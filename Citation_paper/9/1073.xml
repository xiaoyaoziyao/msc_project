<abstract>
<p>In this paper we study the Buckley-James estimator of accelerated failure time models with auxiliary covariates. Instead of postulating distributional assumptions on the auxiliary covariates, we use a local polynomial approximation method to accommodate them into the Buckley-James estimating equations. The regression parameters are obtained iteratively by minimizing a consecutive distance of the estimates. Asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator are investigated. Simulation studies show that the efficiency gain of using auxiliary information is remarkable when compared to just using the validation sample. The method is applied to the PBC data from the Mayo Clinic trial in primary biliary cirrhosis as an illustration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is not uncommon to have one or more missing or mismeasured covariates in large cohort epidemiological studies. There are always cases in medical studies, where it is difficult to obtain an accurate measurement for all patients due to a procedure being too expensive or invasive. Alternatively, some auxiliary measurements which are less precise, but highly related to the target procedure, can be easily collected. In some situations, all of the measurements are error prone, while in other cases, a validation subsample, where the measurements are all accurately taken, is made available.</p>
<p>The former is a pure measurement error problem. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the inference of the latter cases in a failure time setting. In some cases, the validation sample could be large enough on its own, so one could choose to ignore all data from subjects that have missing or mismeasured values for any of the covariates, with just a minor efficiency loss. However, if the validation sample is relatively small, utilizing the auxiliary information will lead to remarkable efficiency gain, as our simulation results will show.</p>
<p>The literature on statistical inference of missing or mismeasured data of failure time regression models is abundant. Ignoring the measurement errors in modeling could lead to severe estimation bias, depending on the magnitude of the measurement error, hence invalidate the whole inference procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-Prentice1">[1]</xref> Prentice, 1982). See also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-Rubin1">[2]</xref> (Rubin, 1976), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-Fuller1">[3]</xref> (Fuller, 1987), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-Carrol1">[4]</xref> (Carrol et al., 1995), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-Wang1">[5]</xref> (Wang et al., 1998) among others. The negative influence of mismeasured or missing covariates is largely understood for the Cox proportional hazards model. But the same cannot be said of accelerated failure time models. Details about the Cox model can be seen in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-Cox1">[6]</xref> (Cox, 1972), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-Cox2">[7]</xref> (Cox and Oakes, 1984), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-Kalbfleisch1">[8]</xref> (Kalbfleisch and Prentice, 2002), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-Hu1">[9]</xref> (Hu et al., 1998), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-Hu2">[10]</xref> (Hu and Lin, 2002), and the references therein. See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-Zhou1">[11]</xref> (Zhou and Pepe, 1995), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-Zhou2">[12]</xref> (Zhou and Wang, 2000), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-Liu1">[13]</xref> (Liu, Zhou and Cai, 2009), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-Fan1">[14]</xref> (Fan and Wang, 2009), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-Liu2">[15]</xref> (Liu, Wu and Zhou, 2010) censored survival models with auxiliary covariates.</p>
<p>However, due to the direct physical interpretation of the AFT models, and the fact that AFT models are robust to model misspecification in the sense that ignoring a covariate will not lead to much bias in estimating the remaining regression coefficients, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-Cox2">[7]</xref> (Cox and Oakes, 1984), the biasing effect of covariate measurement error on AFT models deserves further investigation. A recent work on the subject of measurement error in AFT models was done by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-He1">[16]</xref> (He et al., 2007), using a simulation and extrapolation approach. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-Yu1">[17]</xref> (Yu and Nan 2010) studied the regression calibration approach within the semiparametric framework, assuming a known parametric relationship between the accurately measured covariates and their auxiliaries, up to a few unknown nuisance parameters. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-Granville1">[18]</xref> (Granville and Fan, 2012) studied the parametric AFT models with auxiliary covariates based on maximum likelihood method.</p>
<p>In this paper, we study the Buckley-James estimator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-Buckley1">[19]</xref> (Buckley and James, 1979) of AFT models with auxiliary covariates. The Buckley-James estimator was shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-Jin1">[20]</xref> (Jin et al., 2006) to be consistent and asymptotically normal when using a consistent estimator as the initial value, due to its asymptotic linearity. Some other insights about the consistency and asymptotic theory of this estimator has been investigated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-James1">[21]</xref> (James and Smith, 1984) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-Lai1">[22]</xref> (Lai and Ying,1991), among others. We propose a local polynomial approximation method to handle the missing or mismeasured covariates, through the estimation of the conditional expectation of the unobservable estimating functions. This approach makes neither distributional assumptions about the model error term <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, beyond it having mean zero and a finite variance, nor parametric assumptions on the relationship between the correctly measured covariates and their auxiliary variables. The proposed approach will be introduced through a kernel smoothing method, a special case of the local polynomial approximation, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-Fan1">[14]</xref> (Fan and Wang, 2009), mainly due to the ease of presentation. See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-Nadaraya1">[23]</xref> (Nadaraya, 1964), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-Watson1">[24]</xref> (Watson, 1964), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-Wand1">[25]</xref> (Wand and Jones, 1995) for details of kernel smoothing. Intensive simulation studies were conducted to investigate the small sample performance of our proposed method. The results show a remarkable efficiency gain over the method which ignores the auxiliary information.</p>
<p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the second Section, we introduce Buckley-James estimator for the accelerated failure time model and present our estimation method. Then we investigate the asymptotic properties of our proposed estimator. The Section thereafter contains the results and discussion of our numerical studies, including simulations and the PBC data illustration. In the last Section, we put forth some concluding remarks. The proofs for Theorems were deferred to the appendix.</p>

<title>Inference Methods of Accelerated Failure Time Model</title>
<p>Let <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> be the failure and censoring times for the <italic>i</italic>th subject in a large study cohort. Due to the censoring, we observe <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as well as a failure indicator <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Let <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denote the covariate vector where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the component which is only observed in the validation set and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the component that is available for the full study cohort. Let <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> be the auxiliary covariate to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Hence the data consists of the validation sample <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and the nonvalidation sample <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In this paper we assume that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is scalar, mainly because of the simplicity of the presentation, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> may be either a scalar or a vector. In practice, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> could also be closely correlated with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. A special case is the classical measurement error model <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the error encountered when measuring <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. It is assumed that the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s are independent and identically distributed random normal variables, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> observations, the validation sample contains <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> observations, and the non-validation sample contains <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> observations.</p>
<p>The accelerated failure time model based solely on the validation sample, can be expressed as<disp-formula id="pone.0104817.e026"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e026" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a vector of unknown regression coefficients and the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s are independent and identically distributed with an unspecified distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> which has mean zero and finite variance. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0104817.e026">Equation (1</xref>) assumes automatically that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> provides no additional information about the failure time, given <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>Without making any assumption to the distribution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the Buckley-James least squares procedure (Buckley and James, 1979) estimates the regression parameters through the minimization of<disp-formula id="pone.0104817.e033"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>The least squares estimates of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are such that<disp-formula id="pone.0104817.e036"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e036" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>and<disp-formula id="pone.0104817.e037"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e037" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>In order to deal with censoring, let <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Then <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, so <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula></p>
<p>The estimators <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> then satisfy<disp-formula id="pone.0104817.e045"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e045" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula>and<disp-formula id="pone.0104817.e046"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e046" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>However, the distribution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is unknown. The distribution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and consequently, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are both unknown. The censored observations are hence replaced by<disp-formula id="pone.0104817.e050"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the residuals, and<disp-formula id="pone.0104817.e053"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>is the Kaplan-Meier Product Limit estimator of the distribution function of the residuals, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a discrete function which will not tend to 1 as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> increases if the largest residual is censored. Therefore, following the convention of Buckley and James, the largest residual is redefined as uncensored for all calculations, if necessary.</p>
<p>Let <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The estimator for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the solution of the following equation,<disp-formula id="pone.0104817.e059"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e059" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>It should be noted that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> depends on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e061" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which is available only for the validation sample. For the non-validation sample we can substitute the estimates of their conditional expectations given the auxiliary and other available covariates. The local polynomial approximation approach can be applied for this purpose, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-Fan1">[14]</xref> (Fan and Wang, 2009). For the simplicity of the presentation, we use the kernel smoothing method to estimate the conditional expectation of the unobserved covariates given the auxiliary information.</p>
<p>Note that this simplification does not necessarily lead to efficiency loss. Since the direct estimation of the conditional expectation of the estimating function depends also on the Kaplan-Meier estimation of the survival function of the regression residuals, it could also introduce additional instability into the inference, as compared with imputing the estimated conditional expectation of the mismeasured covariate. Our simulation also revealed this observation (results not included).</p>
<p>The conditional expectation of the mis-measured covariate, denoted by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e062" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, can be estimated as<disp-formula id="pone.0104817.e063"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e063" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(7)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the kernel function and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the chosen vector of bandwidth. Using these <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s in place of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> missing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s, we may solve (6) for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> using a numerical method, like Broyden's method. Note that, Broyden's method requires two initial values, while the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-James1">[21]</xref> (James and Smith, 1984) only requires a single initial value. In this function, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the value of (6) when calculated using <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. A very natural selection of the initial value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the least squares regression estimator calculated from the validation sample.</p>
<p>The standard deviation of these estimators is estimated using bootstrapping. For <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> replicates, a simple random sample with replacement of the full sample size is taken from the observed data and the above estimation method for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is repeated on each replicate. A sample standard deviation is then calculated to estimate the true standard deviation of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> estimators.</p>
<p><bold>Remark 1</bold> <italic>In order to retain the same quality of information among the replicated estimations, an alternative method of resampling was attempted to keep the proportion of censored observations constant in each replication. We defined <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to be the total number of observations with uncensored failure times. For <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> replicates, a simple random sample with replacement of size <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was taken from these uncensored observations, and a simple random sample with replacement of size <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was taken from the remaining censored observations. However this alternative method was found to underestimate the true standard deviations and resulted in coverage probabilities that were lower than the nominal level. The reason of this outcome is mostly due to the fact that the independence of the censoring mechanism was broken by the sampling method.</italic></p>

<title>Defining a Solution</title>
<p>In order to solve the estimating equations for the regression parameters, we use the iterative scheme of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. However, as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-Buckley1">[19]</xref> (Buckley and James, 1979) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-James1">[21]</xref> (James and Smith, 1984), these iterations need not converge. The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> function is discontinuous and piecewise linear in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> so an exact solution may not exist. When this is the case, the iterations can oscillate between two values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We define a possible alternate solution which is closest to satisfying <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. If <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is oscillating between two points due to the lack of an exact solution, we define the alternate solution as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that minimizes the modulus of this difference,<disp-formula id="pone.0104817.e089"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e089" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(8)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>When the iterations do not converge, a cut-off point has to be determined to stop the iterations. It is advised to select a number of iterations that is slightly greater than the amount required for the convergence when a solution typically does exist. For most of our simulations, we have set this point at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In many cases, our simulations converge in three or four steps. So at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> breaks the loop when checked against <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e094" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for convergence, implying the solution being reached at iteration <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e095" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. If the iteration does not converge, the first ten values are checked and whichever value, after, say 5 steps of iteration, satisfies <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0104817.e089">equation (8</xref>) is selected as a solution.</p>
<p>When dealing with real data, it is advised to choose an arbitrarily large number for the cut-off point to find the best possible solution.</p>

<title>Asymptotics</title>
<p>In this section, we investigate the asymptotic properties of our proposed estimator. For that sake, we rewrite the estimating function and the Kaplan-Meier estimator of the residual survival function in the counting process frame work.

<p>The Buckley-James estimator solves the above equation.</p>
<p>When some of the covariates are accurately recorded only for the validation sample, but with relevant auxiliary information available for the whole study cohort, the estimating functions involved those mis-measured covariates belonging to the nonvalidation sample. We propose to estimate those terms by using the local polynomial approximation approach.

<p>In this section we examine the small sample performance of our proposed estimator. Let <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e240" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denote our proposed estimator of the regression coefficients. Its small sample performance is compared with three alternative estimators: the validation estimator (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e241" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) which is based solely on the validation sample; the naive estimator (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e242" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), which ignores the measurement error by assuming that the unobserved <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e243" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s are equal to the observed <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e244" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s; and the complete case estimator (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e245" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), when we assume that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e246" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are observed for the whole study cohort.</p>
<p>The data for the simulations was generated in the following way. The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e247" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e248" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are generated from a uniform distribution, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e249" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For each <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e250" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the auxiliary covariate is defined as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e251" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e252" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is generated from a normal distribution with mean zero and standard deviation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e253" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e254" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> determines the magnitude of the measurement error. The failure times were then defined as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e255" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e256" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e257" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s were taken to be independent and identically distributed from either a standard normal, standard extreme value, or logistic distribution, respectively.</p>
<p>Various other parameters are controlled over all simulations. Each run calculates 1000 replicates in the bootstrapping to give consistent estimators of the standard deviations. The parameters were chosen as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e258" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Within a simulation, the censoring times are randomly generated from a uniform distribution with lower limit 0 and an appropriate upper limit to ensure an approximate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e259" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e260" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> censor rate. The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e261" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e262" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values are chosen to be either <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e263" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e264" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, having half of the data in the validation set, or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e265" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e266" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, with the validation set containing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e267" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the data. Finally, two values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e268" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are selected, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e269" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e270" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For the kernel smoothing used to calculate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e271" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the Gaussian kernel function is selected, which has an order of 2,<disp-formula id="pone.0104817.e272"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e272" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e273" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

<p>The standard error (SE), standard deviation (SD), and coverage probability (CP) are calculated for each set of simulations. The SE values are the sample standard deviations of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e275" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> estimates, the SD values are the mean standard deviations generated from the bootstrapping in each simulation, and CP is equal to the percentage of simulations that had the true <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e276" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> value within a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e277" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> confidence interval around its estimate when using the result of the bootstrapping for the standard deviation.

<list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item>
<p>Estimators <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e357" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e358" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are performing very well for each of the three error distributions.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>Naive estimator <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e359" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is biased when the measurement error variance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e360" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is large.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e361" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> estimator is more efficient than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e362" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, having standard errors comparable to that of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e363" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>The proposed method removes the estimation bias in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e364" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, both for the regression coefficient of the error-prone covariate and that of the accurately measured covariates.</p>
</list-item><list-item>

<title>Application to PBC Data</title>
<p>To illustrate how to use the smoothing method in practice, we analyze the data from the Mayo Clinic trial in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver. PBC is a chronic liver disease that inflames and slowly destroys the bile ducts in the liver, impairing its ability to function properly. It is believed to be a type of autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the bile ducts. PBC occurs primarily in women, with approximately <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e370" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of patients being women, most often between the ages of 40 and 60. There is currently no known cure for the disease; the only known way to remove PBC is through a liver transplant, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-National1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104817-Primary1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the Mayo Clinic trial, 418 patients were eligible. Of these patients, mostly complete data was obtained from the first 312 patients. The remaining 106 patients were not part of the actual clinical trial but had some basic measurements taken and were followed for survival. The variables we used in our regression on the logarithm of time were <italic>age</italic>, patient's age (in years); <italic>albumin</italic>, serum albumin (in mg/dl); <italic>ast</italic>, aspartate aminotransferase (in U/ml), once referred to as SGOT; <italic>bili</italic>, serum bilirunbin (in mg/dl); <italic>copper</italic>, urine copper (ug/day); <italic>edema</italic>, equal to 0 if no edema, 0.5 if untreated or successfully treated, or 1 if there exists edema despite diuretic therapy; <italic>protime</italic>, standardized blood clotting time. Of these, two cases were examined using either ast or copper for our <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e371" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> covariate to be smoothed due to incomplete data, while the others are mostly complete and thus are included in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e372" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>Edema was split into two categorical variables, <italic>edema05</italic> and <italic>edema1</italic>, defined as<disp-formula id="pone.0104817.e373"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e373" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>and<disp-formula id="pone.0104817.e374"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e374" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>We also took the log transformation of <italic>albumin</italic>, <italic>ast</italic>, <italic>bili</italic>, <italic>copper</italic>, and <italic>protime</italic>, in the interest of making their marginal distributions closer to normal. For the smoothing of the unobserved <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e375" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e376" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e377" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was chosen as the auxiliary covariate for both due to its high correlation (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e378" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) with both variables. The bandwidth <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e379" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was calculated using the sample standard deviation of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e380" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, resulting in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e381" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e382" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> using the same formula as in the numerical simulations, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e383" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Any observations missing a value for either of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e384" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> covariates were removed, leaving both cases with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e385" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> while <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e386" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the model using <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e387" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e388" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the model using <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e389" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>Examining <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0104817-t004">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0104817-t005">5</xref>, we see that both <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e390" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> variables had their estimated standard deviations increase by a small amount due to the error added into the model from smoothing for a missing covariate instead of a mismeasured one. If <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e391" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was of the form <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e392" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> like in the simulations, it could have resulted in a higher correlation between the auxiliary variable, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e393" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e394" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> variable, depending on the magnitude of the measurement error. Despite the small increase in standard deviation the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e395" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> term becomes significant at the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e396" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> confidence level after smoothing, and while <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e397" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was already significant, the p-value did decrease. For the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e398" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> variables, we see that they all have a smaller or approximately equal standard deviation after smoothing, which is expected when using the full sample size without needing smoothing for those variables, except for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e399" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the intercept term which increased.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this paper we proposed the use of the Buckley-James estimator as a nonparametric method of estimating the regression parameters of an accelerated failure time model with auxiliary covariates. Kernel smoothing was applied using the auxiliary covariates to estimate missing or mismeasured covariates. The Buckley-James method is then applied to the whole study cohort for the inference of the covariates effect. The standard deviations of the estimates of the regression coefficients are estimated through bootstrapping. The proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal.</p>
<p>This method was most effective in the case of mis-measured data due to the naturally high correlation between the corresponding <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e406" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e407" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> variables which resulted in the estimator involving the smoothing, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e408" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, being more efficient than the validation estimator, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104817.e409" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, as shown in the numerical simulations. The method should also perform well for the missing variable case given a sufficiently strong correlation. The method was applied to the PBC data as an illustration.</p>
<p>The smoothing model is set up in a general format. In applications, we should only choose those variables which are highly related to the mismeasured one. By doing so we can avoid the situations such as the auxiliary covariates only occupy a narrow region, which could cause instability in the local smoothing, hence the whole model.</p>
<p>Caution should also be taken when the proposed method is applied to a data with extremely small validation sample. A classic measurement error model might be a better option, where one can estimate the measurement error variance using the validation sample.</p>
