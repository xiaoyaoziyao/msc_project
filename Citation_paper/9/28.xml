<abstract>
<p>Antithrombin III (AT) is the main inhibitor of blood coagulation proteases like thrombin and factor Xa. In this study we report the identification and characterization of several variants of AT for the first time in Indian population. We screened 1950 deep vein thrombosis (DVT) patients for AT activity and antigen levels. DNA sequencing was further carried out in patients with low AT activity and/or antigen levels to identify variations in the AT gene. Two families, one with type I and the other with type II AT deficiency were identified. Three members of family I showed an increase in the coagulation rates and recurrent thrombosis in this family was solely attributed to the rs2227589 polymorphism. Four members of family II spanning two generations had normal antigen levels and decreased AT activity. A novel single nucleotide insertion, g.13362_13363insA in this family in addition to g.2603T&gt;C (p.R47C) mutation were identified. AT purified from patient’s plasma on hi-trap heparin column showed a marked decrease in heparin affinity and thrombin inhibition rates. Western blot analysis showed the presence of aggregated AT. We also report a novel point mutation at position g.7549 A&gt;G (p.T280A), that is highly conserved in serpin family. Variant protein isolated from patient plasma indicated loss of regulatory function due to <italic>in-vivo</italic> polymerization. In conclusion this is the first report of AT mutations in SERPINC1 gene in Indo-Aryan population where a novel point mutation p.T280A and a novel single nucleotide insertion g.13362_13363insA are reported in addition to known variants like p.R47C, p.C4-X and polymorphisms of rs2227598, <italic>Pst</italic>I and <italic>Dde</italic>I.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Thrombosis is a complex disease associated with most of the vascular disorders including myocardial infraction, cerebrovascular &amp; peripheral arterial diseases and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Under normal conditions, procoagulant, anticoagulant and fibrinolytic pathways regulate hemostasis to avoid pathological clot formation [<xref rid="pone.0121889.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121889.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, any inadvertent clotting either due to mutation of procoagulant or anticoagulant factors or due to acquired factors may lead to life threatening thromboembolic disorders. Inherited causes of thrombosis include mutations in the genes that encodes for AT, protein C (PC), protein S (PS), factor V and factor II [<xref rid="pone.0121889.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Antithrombin III (AT), a member of serpin (<underline>ser</underline>ine <underline>p</underline>roteinase <underline>in</underline>hibitor) super-family is the most important endogenous anticoagulant. The significance of AT in hemostasis is evident by the fact that its heterozygous deficiency is associated with increased risk of thrombosis whereas homozygous deficiency might be fatal. AT regulates coagulation by inhibiting thrombin, factors IX, Xa and XI of the blood coagulation system. AT has evolved a complex heparin induced conformational change mechanism to efficiently inhibit these proteases. However this has also made AT prone to structural and functional defects [<xref rid="pone.0121889.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. AT gene (SERPINC1) spans 13.4kb of genomic DNA and is located on chromosome 1q23-25 [<xref rid="pone.0121889.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The first mutation linked to AT deficiency was characterized in 1983 [<xref rid="pone.0121889.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. AT deficiency may be either type I, where both the activity and antigen levels in the plasma are reduced or type II, where normal antigen levels are associated with a reduced AT activity level. Variants like AT Murcia (K241E) causing altered glycosylation pattern [<xref rid="pone.0121889.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], AT Rouen-IV &amp; AT London (R24C) [<xref rid="pone.0121889.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121889.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] that leads to abolition and reduction in inhibitory activity, or those like F229L [<xref rid="pone.0121889.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] causing spontaneous <italic>in vivo</italic> polymerization have provided valuable insight into the underlying mechanism of AT deficiency. In addition to point mutations, rs2227589 polymorphism located at 140bp downstream of exon 1 in the AT gene has also been shown to be associated with a high risk of thrombosis. In a study conducted by Bezemer et al. on 19682 SNPs located in 10887 genes, rs2227589 was found to be one of the three polymorphisms associated with a high risk of DVT [<xref rid="pone.0121889.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) for long has been perceived to be less common in Asian population compared to western population [<xref rid="pone.0121889.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, population-based epidemiological study in Asian countries has demonstrated an increasing incidence of VTE in Asians annually [<xref rid="pone.0121889.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and mutations of AT gene in Asian population has been reported [<xref rid="pone.0121889.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0121889.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although the first report of AT deficiency in an Indian family dates back to 1982 [<xref rid="pone.0121889.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], yet no mutation has been identified in Indian population till date.</p>
<p>In the present study we report the first ever analysis of Indian population with DVT for AT deficiency. Mutations and additional thrombotic risk factors in AT gene were studied in 52 unrelated Indian patients with low AT levels. We report two Indian families, one with type I and the other with type II AT deficiency and the genetic defect in AT gene underlying thrombosis within these families and other unrelated individuals. A novel single nucleotide insertion at g.13362_13363insA and a novel point mutation at position g.7549 G&gt;A causing p.T280A substitution were identified as the genetic basis of DVT. Further analysis of the AT variants showed presence of polymerized AT in patients with type II AT deficiency which leads to reduction in the level of AT activity.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>We screened 1950 Doppler-proven DVT patients in the time span of about two years (October 2011-August 2013) for AT deficiency. Only patients with AT based thrombosis were included in the study and patients with surgery, accident, trauma, pregnancy, central venous catheter, malignancy, infection, dehydration, immobility, systemic illness or low anticoagulant levels other than AT were excluded. Family studies were carried out wherever available. All the patients gave written consent to enter the study and ethical clearance was obtained from Institute Ethics Committee of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and Jamia Millia Islamia University, New Delhi, India.</p>

<title>AT assay and other thrombophilic tests</title>
<p>Plasma AT activity levels were determined by amidolytic heparin cofactor assay with chromogenic substrate CBS 61.50 (STA-STACHROM ATIII; Diagnostica stago, France). AT antigen levels were determined by latex immunoassay (LIATEST ATIII; Diagnostica stago, Asnieres, France). Prothrombin time (PT), thromboplastin time (TT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were performed using kits from Diagnostiga STAGO. Plasma levels of PC and PS were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the kits used were Asserachrom sEPCR ELISA from Diagnostica Stago (Asnières, France). Homocysteine (SHO) and Beta-2 glycoprotein (β-2 gp) levels were measured by enzyme immunoassay by using kits from AXIS-SHIELD, Scotland and GA Generic assays GmbH, Germany respectively. All the assays were carried out as per the manufacturer’s protocol.</p>

<title>Structure prediction for g.13362_13363insA in family II</title>
<p>Since, mutated exon 6 bears poor homology with any known structure, so its tertiary structure was predicted using threading based method, I-TASSER [<xref rid="pone.0121889.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Further, MODELLER [<xref rid="pone.0121889.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] was used for the prediction of complete mutant AT bearing mutated exon 6. The template used in MODELLER was native AT (PDB ID: 1E05 chain I) and I-TASSER generated mutant exon 6.

<title>Family I</title>
<p>Three patients in family I were with very low and comparable AT activity and antigen levels (<xref rid="pone.0121889.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0121889.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The proband in family I had a stroke at the age of 18 years and his younger brother was also suffering from thrombosis. Anticoagulant based testing revealed significantly low AT levels in all three. Further, considerably reduced PT indicated a hypercoagulable state due to defects in extrinsic pathway (<xref rid="pone.0121889.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Nucleotide sequencing of the entire protein encoding region of the SERPINC1 gene revealed no changes. Complete sequencing of the introns and promoter region showed variation at position 786 (rs2227589) in the symptomatic proband and his sibling but not in asymptomatic father. The known polymorphism [<xref rid="pone.0121889.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] was confirmed by sequencing of the intron I region from both forward and reverse primers, and sequencing of the region containing the polymorphism was repeated three times with fresh template each time (<xref rid="pone.0121889.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). In addition to family I, rs2227589 polymorphism was also studied in rest of the DVT patients and the allele frequencies were estimated to be G:0.86 and A:0.14 (<xref rid="pone.0121889.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>).</p>

<p>In family II, mother and three of the six siblings in the second generation were presented with low AT activity levels and normal antigen levels (<xref rid="pone.0121889.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The proband II(1)F was a 28 year old Indian female who had recurrent abortions in August 2009, January 2010 and January 2012 and was referred to AIIMS. PC (100%), PS (90%), β-2 gp (1%) and SHO (14μmol/l) levels were found to be normal, while significant reduction was found in AT activity levels with normal antigen levels (57%, 94% respectively). APTT levels were found to be drastically reduced with normal PT and TT levels (<xref rid="pone.0121889.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Blood samples were obtained from family members where available and sequencing of the entire exonic region of SERPINC1 gene was carried out. A previously reported point mutation at position g.2603T&gt;C (p.R47C) [<xref rid="pone.0121889.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] was observed in four members of this family (<xref rid="pone.0121889.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). It has been reported previously that R47 located in the helix-A is involved in interaction with heparin, and the variant (R47C) is known to compromise its heparin binding affinity [<xref rid="pone.0121889.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In addition to R47C variant, we also observed a single nucleotide insertion, g.13362_13363insA in the proband and siblings.

<p>The protein sequence translated from the AT gene sequence of proband revealed a frameshift mutation p.P416SfsX16 that results in the formation of a new C-terminal coding sequence, causing early termination. 22 out of 30 C-terminal residues in mutated exon 6 coded for an entirely new protein sequence. Tertiary structure of mutated AT modelled structure in comparison with the wild type AT revealed a contrasting conformational change in P416-C431 stretch that is coded by mutated exon 6. We observed that residues P416-K432 which are deep seated in wild type become exposed in case of the mutant AT (p.P416SfsX16). Possible orientation of this stretch showed that expulsion of s3B &amp; s4B may have contributed to oligomer formation by loop-sheet mechanism (<xref rid="pone.0121889.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>).

Fractions with polymer like band were pooled &amp; buffer exchanged and run on sephadex G-100 gel filtration column (<xref rid="pone.0121889.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>) and two major peaks, designated as peak 1 and peak 2 were obtained.

Fractions of Peak 1 containing high molecular weight bands were pooled, concentrated and subjected to structural analysis (<xref rid="pone.0121889.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D-5G</xref>). A temperature dependent analysis showed that T<sub>m</sub> (78.13 ± 0.18) of this pooled fraction presumed to contain p.T280A mutant was much higher than the wild type AT (61.06.45 ± 0.08), where the T<sub>m</sub> of wild type was similar as reported earlier (<xref rid="pone.0121889.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0121889.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

Bis-ANS binding to p.T280A (<xref rid="pone.0121889.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>) showed a comprehensive reduction in the surface exposed hydrophobic patches in the variant as compared to the wild type AT.

T280 hydrogen bonding to E271 and R413 in the native state (<xref rid="pone.0121889.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>) may be leading to its destabilization in the variant.</p>

A Dutch study identified rs2227589 along with two other polymorphisms as strong genetic factors contributing to DVT. It was performed on 3 large case control studies, LETS (443 cases and 453 controls; OR: 1.42; p-value: 0.03), MEGA-1 (1398 cases and 1757 controls; OR: 1.24; p-value: 0.01) and MEGA-2 (1314 cases and 2877 controls; OR: 1.29; p-value: &lt;0.001), and indicated that rs2227589 was associated with a modest thrombotic tendency [<xref rid="pone.0121889.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A meta-analysis performed later on 1076 cases and 1239 controls in black population with an aim of replicating the Dutch study confirmed association of rs2227589 with DVT [<xref rid="pone.0121889.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>
<p>In the present study, two families with different defects in AT gene leading to DVT have been identified in Indian population. A flow chart summarizing the features of the study is presented as <xref rid="pone.0121889.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>. The underlying cause of DVT in family I with low AT antigen and activity levels along with drastically reduced PT was found to be rs2227589. The presence of homozygous AA genotype in proband and his younger brother explains the probable cause of DVT. The presence of rs2227589 in absence of any other mutation in protein coding region makes it important to study this polymorphism in cases where no acquired or genetic factor appears to be contributing to DVT. In addition to family I, rs2227589 was also found to be present in other DVT patients with lower AT levels. The frequency of A allele (0.14) in Indian patients was found to be consistent with that reported earlier in Caucasian population, A: 0.12 (The Dutch study) and indeed AA genotype appeared to be associated with lower AT levels and was not found in any of the healthy controls (p value: &lt;0.0001) (<xref rid="pone.0121889.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Pst</italic>I polymorphism was observed in family II and other patients but was found to be only a genetic variation in SERPINC1 gene as reported earlier [<xref rid="pone.0121889.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and was not associated with lower AT levels (p value: 0.4) (<xref rid="pone.0121889.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>).</p>

<p>Type II AT deficiency is known to affect either the reactive site domain, heparin binding site (HBS) or have pleiotropic effects. These changes are caused by single base pair substitutions and only two exceptions are known, where a deletion or insertion has been reported to be associated with type II AT deficiency. One such variant is AT London, which lacks R393 resulting in loss of inhibitory activity [<xref rid="pone.0121889.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and the other is a 24 nucleotide insertion reported in a 51-year old Caucasian male located between strand 3A (s3A) and helix F [<xref rid="pone.0121889.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] that caused severe thrombotic history in the family. In our study the proband in family II was presented with a hypercoagulable state as indicated by reduced APTT and low AT activity levels. The family members were diagnosed with a type II AT deficiency and were found to have a single nucleotide insertion, g.13362_13363insA and a point mutation causing p.R47C substitution (<xref rid="pone.0121889.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Figs. <xref rid="pone.0121889.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> &amp; <xref rid="pone.0121889.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The single insertion g.13362_13363insA was present in three members of the family and resides near s4B and s5B of AT whereas g.2603T&gt;C (p.R47C) mutation present in all the four members resides in the HBS of AT. The single base insertion causes frameshift of amino acids from 416 to 432 (p.P416SfsX16).</p>
<p>Elution profile (<xref rid="pone.0121889.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) showed elution of variant AT at lower ionic strength from Hi-trap heparin column as indicated by shift in the inhibitory activity and appearance of larger peak at much lower ionic strength. Oligomeric bands were observed in the Western blot of the proband but not in the mother who carried only p.R47C variant. This clearly indicates that it is the conformational change associated with insertion g.13362_13363insA which increases the polymer forming ability of variant and p.R47C decreases the heparin binding affinity of variant AT. Previous studies also indicate that mutations in this region lead to a global conformational change abolishing thrombin inhibition and decreasing heparin affinity [<xref rid="pone.0121889.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Mutations affecting this region relay structural changes in the distal HBS by perturbing the B sheet and the core of the molecule [<xref rid="pone.0121889.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and both these findings are supported by our study. Exposure of the mutated region as opposed to deep seated structure in wild type AT as observed by <italic>in silico</italic> study explains the probable mechanism of polymerization. The frame shifted region was modelled beyond residue number 416 using a thread based structure modelling of the 22 C-terminal residues and indicated the maintenance of the sheets. Modelled structure showed expulsion of s3B and s4B (<xref rid="pone.0121889.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). Expulsion of strands of β-sheet B may result in the insertion of RCL of another intact molecule into the sheet B resulting in loop sheet type of polymer formation.</p>
<p>T280 resides on strand 3B in a highly conserved region in serpin superfamily (<xref rid="pone.0121889.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Based on the biochemical and <italic>in silico</italic> studies we can predict the nature of the changes in the conformation of p.T280A as compared to the wild type AT. Indication of abnormal complex on Western blot analysis of AT purified from patient plasma (<xref rid="pone.0121889.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>) and massive increase in T<sub>m</sub> (<xref rid="pone.0121889.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>) indicated high molecular weight polymer like species. Similar observations have been made previously where neuroserpin polymers formed <italic>in vitro</italic> were accompanied by massive increase in T<sub>m</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0121889.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A decrease in the fluorescence emission spectra (<xref rid="pone.0121889.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>), decrease in the overall exposed hydrophobic surfaces (<xref rid="pone.0121889.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>) and alteration in the secondary structure of the variant (<xref rid="pone.0121889.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>) as compared to the wild type indicated the presence of a structure which is quite different from the wild type and is compact like a polymer. T280 is deeply buried (<xref rid="pone.0121889.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>) and is involved in hydrogen bond interactions with R413 and E271 (<xref rid="pone.0121889.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). One plausible mechanism for the presence of high molecular weight band in the Western blot may be that the removal of side chain hydrogen bond with β-strand 2B (E271) and β-strand 4B (R413) might have introduced local destabilization resulting in the opening of sheet B (<xref rid="pone.0121889.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). This may allow insertion of RCL of intact AT into the β-sheet B producing loop sheet type of oligomers (<xref rid="pone.0121889.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). An increase in the high molecular weight polymer bands was observed in the p.T280A variant (peak 1, <xref rid="pone.0121889.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref> inset), run on size exclusion sephadex G-100 column. As previously reported, ATIII Budapest (P429L) and other natural variants in strand 1C (P407L) are in close proximity originating in β-sheet B, and are associated with considerable loss of heparin affinity and protease inhibition ability [<xref rid="pone.0121889.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121889.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Close proximity of this region with RCL influences thrombin binding and leads to loss of heparin affinity that indicates its long range connectivity with HBS. Further, a sheet B variant, G424R at the carboxy terminus has been reported to be associated with presence of polymer like abnormal complex [<xref rid="pone.0121889.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Based on these collective evidences it seems that mutation at position g.7549 A&gt;G (p.T280A) identified in our study causes polymerization of AT <italic>in vivo</italic>, thus resulting in clinical manifestation of disease in the patient with type II AT deficiency. Indication of polymers in G424R variant and in our study and the presence of serine/threonine in equivalent position in highly conserved region in most of the serpin family members (<xref rid="pone.0121889.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>) and observation of an increase in the α-helical content (<xref rid="pone.0121889.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>) in our study warrants more work to resolve the molecular basis of defects associated with this region.</p>
<p>In conclusion, AT as a risk factor for DVT in Indian population is not different from that reported in western population. This is the first Indian study where novel and known variants are identified in AT gene in DVT population. Two families and three individual patients with low AT levels and genetic variations in AT gene were identified. A known polymorphism previously known to be associated with thrombotic risk was found to be the underlying cause of DVT in one family and in another family two independent mutations causing conformational change in AT leading to thrombosis was identified. A novel point mutation (p.T280A) was identified in a highly conserved region and is hypothesized to be involved in polymerization. The detection of mutations and polymorphisms like C-4X, g.13362_13363insA, g.2603T&gt;C (p.R47C), g.7549G&gt;A (p.T280A), rs2227589, <italic>Pst</italic>I and <italic>Dde</italic>I in Indian population warrants a much larger study to understand prevalence and molecular basis in large Indian population (1.3 billion).</p>
