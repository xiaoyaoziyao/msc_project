<abstract>
<p>In an era of biodiversity crisis, arthropods have great potential to inform conservation assessment and test hypotheses about community assembly. This is because their relatively narrow geographic distributions and high diversity offer high-resolution data on landscape-scale patterns of biodiversity. However, a major impediment to the more widespread application of arthropod data to a range of scientific and policy questions is the poor state of modern arthropod taxonomy, especially in the tropics. Inventories of spiders and other megadiverse arthropods from tropical forests are dominated by undescribed species. Such studies typically organize their data using morphospecies codes, which make it difficult for data from independent inventories to be compared and combined. To combat this shortcoming, we offer cyberdiversity, an online community-based approach for reconciling results of independent inventory studies where current taxonomic knowledge is incomplete. Participating scientists can upload images and DNA barcode sequences to dedicated databases and submit occurrence data and links to a web site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.digitalSpiders.org" xlink:type="simple">www.digitalSpiders.org</ext-link>). Taxonomic determinations can be shared with a crowdsourcing comments feature, and researchers can discover specimens of interest available for loan and request aliquots of genomic DNA extract. To demonstrate the value of the cyberdiversity framework, we reconcile data from three rapid structured inventories of spiders conducted in Vietnam with an independent inventory (Doi Inthanon, Thailand) using online image libraries. Species richness and inventory completeness were assessed using non-parametric estimators. Community similarity was evaluated using a novel index based on the Jaccard replacing observed with estimated values to correct for unobserved species. We use a distance-decay framework to demonstrate a rudimentary model of landscape-scale changes in community composition that will become increasingly informative as additional inventories participate. With broader adoption of the cyberdiversity approach, networks of information-sharing taxonomists can more efficiently and effectively address taxonomic impediments while elucidating landscape scale patterns of biodiversity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As biodiversity continues its unabated decline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Butchart1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Barnosky1">[2]</xref>, taxonomic and geographic biases constrain our ability to understand and predict the consequences of these losses and devise effective mitigation strategies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Gaston1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Gaston2">[4]</xref>. In terms of richness and abundance, arthropods dominate animal life, especially in the tropics. Yet vertebrates and vascular plants, both of which have comparatively low diversity, are the dominant study subjects for assessing the biological ramifications of anthropogenic perturbations and establishing conservation priorities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Ferrier1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-DAmen1">[7]</xref>. While vertebrates have been shown to be poor surrogates for arthropod conservation priorities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Ferrier1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-DAmen1">[7]</xref>, the geographic distribution of arthropod species has been found to reliably predict the conservation priorities of vertebrates (i.e., optimizing networks of reserve areas to maximize the persistence of species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Margules1">[8]</xref>). This asymmetry arises largely because the geographic ranges and environmental tolerances of individual arthropod species tend to be more restricted than vertebrates or vascular plants, enabling megadiverse arthropod groups to track ecological gradients at finer spatial resolution. Because of their high richness and sensitivity to environmental variables, arthropods offer some of the finest-grained data with which to assess terrestrial biodiversity at individual localities (alpha [α] diversity) and changes across landscapes (beta [β] diversity) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Ferrier1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Ferrier2">[9]</xref>. However, one of the greatest impediments to the broader use of arthropod communities for studying and maintaining global biodiversity is our current profoundly incomplete and geographically biased data on fundamental taxonomy. Substantial proportions of arthropods, especially those found in tropical regions, have yet to be formally described and lack scientific names <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Cardoso1">[10]</xref>. Yet, names are the mechanism by which data about a species (including geographic distribution) are aggregated. The process of naming and describing species, however, is time-consuming. While online innovations are increasing the pace of species descriptions and improving accessibility to taxonomic data, these advances come at a time when investment and training in taxonomy is declining <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Riedel1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Wheeler1">[12]</xref>. If the fine-grained pattern of arthropod biodiversity is to be broadly integrated into conservation assessment, it is apparent that we need to diminish dependence on formal scientific names. To accommodate this need, an alternative model is emerging designed to share biodiversity data that is not yet ready for formal taxonomic publication so researchers may efficiently and effectively evaluate and integrate that information with other data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Maddison1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Schindel1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>Two technological advances are revolutionizing standard practice in inventories of arthropods (including spiders): (1) the increased accessibility of digital photomicroscopy, and (2) DNA barcoding. Perhaps the most precocious online collection of digital images of a diverse arthropod taxon is AntWeb (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.antweb.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.antweb.org/</ext-link>). At the time of this writing, this global effort offers photos of nearly 16,000 ant species freely available online along with specimen occurrence data. Unidentified ant species referred to only by morphospecies codes (rather than valid Linnaean binomials) in some published studies are also included <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Longino1">[15]</xref>. AntWeb gives independent researchers working in the same region an opportunity to determine which species – including species not yet formally described – are shared between independent studies without the need to physically examine vouchers. Photographs and specimen occurrence records can provide much of the determination power we expect from formal taxonomic literature, even when these resolve to morphospecies codes rather than Linnaean names. DNA barcoding offers an independent method of species identification and classification. This approach involves building a library of sequences from a standard region of the genome to aid species identification and discovery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Ratnasingham1">[16]</xref>. For animals, the ∼648 base pair region of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I has become the dominant barcode marker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Ratnasingham1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Hebert1">[17]</xref>. DNA barcoding as an enterprise has strengths and limitations, and these have been the subject of spirited debate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Song1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Riedel2">[33]</xref>. Within this debate, some have argued convincingly that data from multiple independent sources (e.g., morphology, DNA sequences) should be considered (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Will1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Will2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Dayrat1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Meyer1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Rubinoff3">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Schindel2">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Paquin1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Riedel2">[33]</xref>). Given that classification based on either data source alone fails some of the time, disagreement between approaches indicates the need for focused study to resolve the conflict <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Will1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Will2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Meier1">[34]</xref>. By extension, determining the number of species within and shared between ecological inventories based on a combination of morphological and molecular sequence data is preferable to relying on either method alone. Species-level taxa determined on the basis of combined morphological and DNA sequence data (i.e., without formal names) are referred to as integrated operational taxonomic units (IOTUs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Galimberti1">[35]</xref>.</p>
<p>Spiders are one of the richest orders of life on earth, and structured inventories (i.e., surveys that use replicable sampling protocols with multiple complimentary collecting methods) are fundamental sources of data about species richness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Coddington1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Cardoso2">[38]</xref>. However, inventories in temperate regions have significantly higher proportions of their species identified with scientific names than inventories in tropical regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115750-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). This is perhaps not surprising given the relatively low number of species and high intensity of taxonomic research at temperate latitudes. The consequence of this taxonomic imbalance is that data from temperate inventories may be far more readily integrated with existing knowledge compared to tropical inventories. In regions with relatively undeveloped taxonomic literature, ecological studies typically categorize unidentified species using "morphospecies" concepts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Coddington2">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Erwin1">[41]</xref>. This means using the skills of a morphological taxonomist to classify individuals in the collection without depending on incomplete and fragmentary taxonomic literature. This approach is sufficient for elucidating biodiversity patterns within a particular study, but makes it cumbersome to compare results between independent studies. Conscientious investigators typically deposit voucher specimens in museum or university collections, which means that morphospecies from different studies can be reconciled, but doing so is often prohibitively time consuming. As a consequence, independent biodiversity studies on the same taxa in a single region have limited capacity to build on each other or to document biological patterns beyond the scope of each individual study.</p>

<p>Red portion of each pie chart represents species identified according to formal nomenclature in the original publication; the remaining pink portion represents those identified to morphospecies. Total observed species richness is in yellow. Inset shows significant relationship between distance from the equator (expressed as positivized latitude) and the proportion of identified species (logistic regression; β = 0.113 (β<sub>se</sub> = 0.0488, e<sup>β</sup> = 2.306), <italic>p</italic> = 0.0211, McFadden's R<sup>2</sup> = 0.72). Studies with a high proportion of identified species (which are largely found in temperate regions) are relatively easy to evaluate for community similarity, while studies in regions with more poorly developed taxonomy (e.g., the tropics) may not be as easily reconciled. This roadblock can be bypassed using the cyberdiversity framework, which allows data on the whole community to be made publically available, and can foster reconciliation of independent inventories, including those with high proportions of undescribed species.

<title>The cyberdiversity approach</title>
<p>Cyberdiversity is an online approach to facilitate species recognition regardless of taxonomic determination status. Web-based tools may include collections of digital images, DNA sequences, or ideally both. The cyberdiversity approach engages several recognized impediments to the understanding of fundamental aspects of megadiversity and the wider adoption of arthropod data for conservation assessment. These challenges include (a) the large number of species that remain undescribed, (b) the scientific ignorance concerning the geographic distribution, abundance, and environmental sensitivities of most species, and (c) the lack of awareness of invertebrate conservation issues in the social-political spheres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Cardoso1">[10]</xref>. Photographs and DNA barcodes, organized by persistent unique identifier, allow data on the geographic distribution and abundance of species to be compiled whether or not the species have scientific names <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Maddison1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Schindel1">[14]</xref>. The ready availability of these data through online databases makes the effort visible to a range of stakeholders. Following a central principal of biodiversity informatics, the primary data are formatted according to community standards and digitally exposed in ways that allow them to be aggregated, recombined, and repurposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Peterson1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Thessen1">[44]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here, we introduce a new, expandable cyberdiversity resource: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.digitalSpiders.org" xlink:type="simple">www.digitalSpiders.org</ext-link>, currently populated with data from our three 2009 inventories of Vietnamese spiders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115750-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The web site layout features a three-panel design consisting of (1) a taxonomic navigation tree organized by IOTU within family, (2) species identifier (unique IOTU code, and where available taxonomic name with determination credit), images, records, links to DNA barcode sequences (where available), and user comments, and (3) a map indicating species presence for each inventory location. The three panel design permits simultaneous viewing of morphology and occurrence data, delivering with a single click the most critical information needed to reconcile future inventory data with that currently available on the web site. Unfortunately, the leading collaborative biodiversity data environment, Scratchpads (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scratchpads.eu/" xlink:type="simple">http://scratchpads.eu/</ext-link>), does not currently support such a layout. The digitalSpiders site also makes all records available through Google Earth with markers linked to collections of images on Morphbank. In the Google Earth environment, records can be filtered to display any combination of records or IOTUs. New content can be submitted using the digitalSpiders data template, subject to validation by the site administrator.</p>

<title>Data visualization and schematic data relationships on the digitalSpiders cyberdiversity web site.</title>
<p>(A) The digitalSpiders website is designed around a three-panel layout. The left panel is a taxonomic index to IOTUs. Once an IOTU is selected, the center panel shows the taxonomic name (where available), a collection of images, collection records, and a utility for submitting and viewing public comments. Individual images are linked to higher resolution versions on Morphbank annotated with extensive metadata. The image collection for the IOTU is also linked to a corresponding image collection on Morphbank. Records may be associated with a DNA barcode sequence and linked to the BOLD database. All records can be viewed through Google Earth with markers linked to collections of images on Morphbank. New content can be submitted using the digitalSpiders data template. (B) Data relationships are configured around an IOTU identified by a unique species code. Each IOTU is associated with one or more records. Each of those records is associated with a sample taken at a location. The map is derived from the set of unique locations. All records can be viewed through Google Earth with markers linked to collections of images on Morphbank. Records may be associated with a DNA barcode sequence and linked to the BOLD database. Each IOTU is associated with a collection of one or more images, linked to a corresponding image or image collection on Morphbank. Where an IOTU is associated with a valid taxonomic name, this determination is credited to one or more taxonomists along with their contact information.</p>

<p>Ours is the first structured tropical spider inventory study to include DNA barcode data for most of the sampled community. Fortunately, it is not the first study from the region to make libraries of morphospecies images available online. Images of all morphospecies resulting from a 2003 survey of spiders from Doi Inthanon National Park, Chang Mai Province, Thailand have also been posted online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aracnologia.macn.gov.ar/ThaiPlot/" xlink:type="simple">http://aracnologia.macn.gov.ar/ThaiPlot/</ext-link>). This inventory was conducted in October, the same time of year as our Vietnamese study, by an independent research team. The results of the Doi Inthanon study have not been published in the form of a scientific journal article. Nevertheless, because the leaders of this study chose to post images of their morphospecies online, we were able to rapidly assess characteristics of change in spider communities (β-diversity) across ca. 1,000 km.</p>
<p>The cyberdiversity approach is a call to researchers to share data that facilitate the reconciliation of inventory results across studies, multiplying the number of sites available for analysis. The ultimate goal is to accumulate enough reconciled inventory points to meaningfully model patterns of diversity on regional, continental, and even global scales. With data from only four sites currently available for comparison (three in Vietnam, one in Thailand), we cannot yet provide a definitive analysis of large-scale biodiversity patterns. Instead, we present a series of preliminary analyses to demonstrate the kinds of questions and diversity parameters that can be addressed once more inventories are reconciled.</p>

<title>Modeling horizon: landscape-scale change in megadiverse communities</title>
<p>Once we have assessed community similarity across sites, we can begin to focus on quantifying β-diversity and identifying its geographic and climatic drivers. We present a preliminary demonstration of this in a distance-decay framework <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Nekola1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Soininen1">[46]</xref>, where community change (i.e., pair-wise community similarity) is modeled as exponential decay functions of both the geographic and climatic (WorldClim, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldclim.org/bioclim" xlink:type="simple">http://www.worldclim.org/bioclim</ext-link> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Hijmans1">[47]</xref>) distances between sites. Using this exponential decay framework, we can then estimate the species turnover rate; specifically, the geographic or climatic distance across which half the species are different from one point to another (halving distance; d<sub>0.5</sub>, which is constant across space). We can also estimate the similarity of communities at small distances, specifically the initial similarity (<italic>s</italic><sub>0</sub>), when distance between community samples equals zero. With a sufficient number of sites, variance partitioning can be used to disentangle covariance between geographic and climatic change <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Qian1">[48]</xref>, thought we do not attempt this here. Our preliminary analyses are intended to demonstrate the kinds of questions that are possible to explore with reconciled inventory data.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Our surveys of three study sites in Vietnam yielded 2,009 adult spiders comprising 240 species. Non-parametric species richness estimators (Chao 1, Chao 2, ACE, and ICE) indicate that the Cuc Phuong inventory was the closest to completion (range of mean estimated completeness [hereafter, estimated] 73–82%). The Cuc Phuong inventory yielded the lowest number of observed species (76) and the highest number of individuals (683), so the sampling intensity (the number of individuals per species) was comparatively high (9.0). The Cat Ba inventory was only slightly less complete (estimated 66–73%). The observed species richness in Cat Ba was considerably higher than Cuc Phuong (108) for almost the same number of individuals (680), so the sampling intensity was correspondingly lower (6.3). The Vu Quang inventory was the richest of the three sites with 128 observed species from a sample of only 646 individuals (sampling intensity 5.1). Non-parametric estimators suggest that this inventory was 60–72% complete (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0115750-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115750-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Data include all adult spider specimens collected from one hectare plots in three Vietnamese National Parks: Cat Ba, Cuc Phuong, and Vu Quang. The number of species observed from each inventory, and the number of singletons, unique, doubletons, and duplicates in each inventory are given, as well as four non-parametric estimators of sample completeness: Chao 1, ACE, Chao 2, and ICE (upper 95% confidence intervals provided for Chao 1 and Chao 2). Estimated Inventory completeness is variable, but none are complete. Hence, assessment of community similarity based on these inventories should account for unobserved shared species.</p>

<p>DNA barcode sequences were obtained from 176 of the 240 species in the study (73%).

<p>Intraspecific variation in the barcode sequence was assessed based on 73 species for which more than one individual was successfully sequenced. Of these, within-site variability was assessed using 192 conspecific pairwise comparisons from 63 species, and between-site variability was assessed using 121 conspecific pairwise comparisons from 33 species. Overall, conspecific distances between sites (based on the optimal Felsenstein 1984 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Felsenstein1">[50]</xref> model) were considerably higher than within sites (Mann-Whitney test, U = 3901, z = −9.908, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0001), suggesting geographic population structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115750-g004">Figs. 4A</xref> and S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115750.s001">S1 File</xref>).</p>

<p>We find that community similarity (Chao's estimated proportional similarity) for Southeast Asian spiders is significantly correlated with geographic distance (Mantel test r = 0.99, <italic>p</italic> = 0.042), and that the community halving distance based on all available data is 171 km (Jackknifed mean (mean<sub>J</sub>) and standard error (SE<sub>J</sub>): 192±111 km) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115750-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Initial similarity (i.e., similarity at 0 distance, <italic>s</italic><sub>0</sub>) was 0.43 (mean<sub>J</sub> ± SE<sub>J</sub>: 0.48±0.17). Across the study area, the 19 climatic variables and altitude data are highly correlated, with the first two principal component axes characterizing 99% of the variance (Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115750.s001">S1 File</xref>). Based on a combined distance matrix of those first two principal component axes, we find that Chao's estimated proportional similarity is also significantly correlated with change in climate among sites (Mantel test r = 0.95 <italic>p</italic> = 0.044). Using all available data, initial similarity based on climate was close to that calculated for geographic distance: <italic>s</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.38, but the jackknifed mean and standard error was higher (mean<sub>J</sub> ± SE<sub>J</sub>: 0.68±0.48). The halving distance for climate is d<sub>0.5</sub> = 2.25 (mean<sub>J</sub> ± SE<sub>J</sub>  = 3.00±3.77), which corresponds to a 93.2% (range across ± SE<sub>J</sub>: 80.2–100%) decay in community similarity across the maximum distance of the sampled region. This is within error of the estimated change in community similarity based on the halving distance for geographic change: 96.5% (88–100%).</p>

<p>Cobra analysis (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0115750-t003">Table 3</xref>) revealed both strengths and inefficiencies in our sampling regime. The largest number of sampling hours at all sites were devoted to AEN (searching for spiders in the aerial stratum at night), and this proved to be the most efficient method for species discovery in all cases. In Cat Ba (12 hours), AEN was relatively saturated; in Vu Quang (9 hours), more samples could have been allocated to this method; Cuc Phuong (10 hours) was intermediate. WIN (extraction of arthropods from sifted leaf litter using Winkler traps) ranked second in field hours at all sites (two hours spent sifting leaf litter per sample), and was the second most efficient method in two sites (Cat Ba and Cuc Phuong). WIN at Cat Ba (10 hours) and Vu Quang (8 hours) approached relative saturation, but more WIN samples could have been allocated at Cuc Phuong (8 hours). BED (beating vegetation during the day) ranked third or fourth in efficiency and fourth (or tied for fourth) in effort. BED included moderately to highly efficient samples and more effort could have been usefully allocated here, especially at Cat Ba. LDD (searching for spiders on the ground during the day; 4–6 samples per site) contributed enough unique species to the inventory that it includes some high scores in the Cobra analysis, but most of the species contributed to the inventory using this method would have been collected with fewer samples. LDN (searching for spiders on the ground at night; 6–8 samples per site) was the least efficient method, and included several sample hours at each site that contributed little to the inventory; too much effort was devoted here.</p>

<title>Cyberdiversity takes on the Taxonomic Impediment</title>
<p>Today's urgent need for better biodiversity knowledge is mismatched by the relatively slow pace of taxonomic progress for tropical spiders and other megadiverse groups. Using online databases to increase the recognizability of species regardless of whether they have a scientific name is one way to mitigate this asymmetry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Maddison1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Schindel1">[14]</xref>. For example, on the digitalSpiders web site, each IOTU page features a comments field to facilitate discussion and contribute to taxonomic identification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115750-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Cyberdiversity resources can also serve to stimulate traditional taxonomy; taxonomic specialists can browse the online collection of images and data, find specimens relevant to their research, and request specimen loans and/or aliquots of extracted genomic DNA. With the participation of a broad network of contributors and taxonomists, the cyberdiversity approach can even improve the description rate of the undescribed portion of our global fauna <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Fontaine1">[51]</xref>. In an era of biodiversity crisis, climate change, and other challenges, the scientific and public spheres have common interest in synergies that make research products more responsive to the questions of the day. Thus, practices that make it easier to compare and combine data across different inventory studies are highly desirable for deriving the maximum information value from our research investment. We encourage authors who include specimens and DNA extracts featured on cyberdiversity platforms in their research to follow an open access cybertaxonomic publication model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Miller1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Miller2">[53]</xref>. All data shown on digitalSpiders are protected by a creative commons license, meaning they can be used for third party research provided the original source is cited and derivative works are distributed according to a similar license. A healthy ethic of data sharing can advance research across the community. We ask authors to think carefully about the benefits they derive from shared data and acknowledge accordingly those responsible if they hope to foster this incipient trend.</p>

<title>Sampling strategy and assessment</title>
<p>During structured inventory surveys, a selection of semi-quantitative field sampling methods is typically applied to estimate spider species richness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Coddington1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Coddington2">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Scharff1">[54]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-PinkusRendn1">[67]</xref>. Each sampling method in a structured inventory targets a different portion of the fauna, which may overlap to a greater or lesser extent with other methods. Given that inventories have limited resources, decisions about how to partition effort among the sampling methods can have a major impact on the ultimate completeness of the inventory. To assess and improve sampling design, Cardoso <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Cardoso2">[38]</xref> developed a method for optimizing allocation of sampling effort for spider inventories based on data from three studies conducted in Portugal. His method is based on a <italic>post hoc</italic> randomization analysis of inventory data to determine the optimum allocation of sampling effort by method to maximize species encountered.</p>
<p>Based on results from previous tropical forest inventory studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Coddington2">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Srensen1">[68]</xref>, our structured inventory sampling strategy allocated more time to AEN than any other single collecting method. Cobra analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Cardoso2">[38]</xref> confirmed that AEN was the most efficient method for species discovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115750-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). WIN, which is used in standard inventories of some groups other than spiders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Agosti1">[69]</xref>, was also found to be an efficient method for spiders. These results are in contrast to those found for Portuguese spiders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Cardoso2">[38]</xref>, where pitfall traps and sweeping were the most efficient methods for species accrual and AEN was less crucial. However, direct comparison between Cardoso <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Cardoso2">[38]</xref> and our inventories is complicated due to mismatches in sampling methods: WIN was not included in the Portuguese inventories and neither sweeping nor pitfalls were included in our Vietnamese inventories. Sweeping would seem <italic>a priori</italic> to be a dubious investment in the generally thorny and herb-poor Vietnamese forests, and pitfalls were omitted because of our regrettable failure to locally obtain propylene glycol preservative, which facilitates DNA extraction from pitfall specimens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Vink1">[70]</xref>. Note that the protocol presented by Cardoso <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Cardoso2">[38]</xref> is not intended as a global standard and it is acknowledged that efficient sampling in other regions, including tropical forests, probably requires a different sampling strategy.</p>

<title>Efficiency of sampling methods compared to hours of field time allocated.</title>
<p>Sampling efficiency was scored using the reverse Cobra ranking (see text) for (A) Cat Ba, (B) Cuc Phuong, and (C) Vu Quang. Methods: BED: beating vegetation during the day; AEN: searching for spiders in the aerial stratum at night; LDD: searching for spiders on the ground during the day; LDN: searching for spiders on the ground at night; WIN: extraction of arthropods from sifted leaf litter using Winkler traps. Methods conducted during daylight hours are unfilled, methods conducted during night hours are black-filled. Methods targeting above-ground strata are up-pointing triangles, methods targeting ground strata are down-pointing triangles or a circle (WIN). Each WIN sample required two field hours; samples using all other samples were one hour each. High reversed Cobra scores indicate maximum efficiency of a method for contributing species to the inventory; low scores indicate sampling saturation for that method.</p>

<title>DNA barcodes for species discrimination</title>
<p>Within the BOLD framework, DNA barcode sequences are assigned to species based on cluster analysis and empirically derived interspecific distance thresholds (BIN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Ratnasingham2">[49]</xref>). The distance threshold for animals is typically set at 2–3% sequence divergence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Hebert2">[71]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Hebert3">[72]</xref>. Barrett and Hebert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Barrett1">[73]</xref> reported that a 2% divergence threshold was adequate for discriminating spider species. We found that 2–3% divergence was indeed sufficient to assign most barcodes to species. However, conspecific distances were considerably higher for a few species, especially species shared between sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115750-g004">Figs. 4A</xref> and S1A, C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115750.s001">S1 File</xref>). There are several possible explanations for this, including (a) taxonomic error (some IOTUs in this study may actually represent more than one species), (b) inadvertent amplification of a nuclear pseudogene of mitochondrial origin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Song1">[18]</xref>, and (c) bacterial infection (e.g., <italic>Wolbachia</italic>), which can distort patterns of mitochondrial variation and inheritance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Smith2">[74]</xref>. Alternatively, high conspecific genetic distances may simply reflect variable intra-species divergence, with most species characterized by small (e.g., &lt;2%) divergences and a few species characterized by higher divergences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115750-g004">Figs. 4A</xref> and S1A, C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115750.s001">S1 File</xref>). Species sorting based on integrated analysis of DNA and morphology (IOTUs) found fewer species than the algorithmic approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Ratnasingham2">[49]</xref> based on sequence data alone. Based on IOTU designations and barcode sequences, minimum genetic distances between species were almost always larger than distances within species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115750-g004">Figs. 4B</xref> and S1B, D in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115750.s001">S1 File</xref>). The incongruence between DNA-only (BIN) and the integrated approach (IOTU) is almost certainly attributable to the many rare species that characterize our inventories; without a reasonable estimate of within-species variation, genetic gaps between species can be obscure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Lim1">[75]</xref>. The system of IOTUs presented here is subject to testing and refinement by future studies. Thus, an additional advantage of the cyberdiversity approach is the ability to readily integrate new data with legacy data to test and refine the findings of previous studies. Both IOTU designations and DNA-only BIN codes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Ratnasingham2">[49]</xref> are included in the supporting information to highlight incongruence between the two approaches and facilitate future re-assessment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115750.s002">S1 Appendix</xref>).</p>

<title>Modeling community change</title>
<p>The proportion of shared species is a useful and intuitive concept for comparing two communities. When inventories are nearly complete, the Jaccard index expresses this adequately. But when sampling is incomplete, especially in communities of megadiverse taxa with large proportions of rare species, the Jaccard can underestimate the proportion of shared species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Chao1">[76]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Magurran1">[78]</xref>. Shared rare species present the most significant challenge because they are most likely to be missed in one or both inventories. To account for unobserved shared species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Chao1">[76]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Chao3">[79]</xref>, we replace the observed values in the Jaccard with estimated ones (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">methods</xref>). We use the ACE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Chao4">[80]</xref> to estimate richness of each community because the shared species estimator is an extension of the ACE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Chao2">[77]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Magurran1">[78]</xref>. We call this Chao's estimated proportional similarity. Note that combining estimated values in this way can inflate the variance of the resulting community similarity estimate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Chao3">[79]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Gotelli1">[81]</xref>. Chao's estimated proportional similarity should not be confused with Chao's abundance-based Jaccard index <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Chao1">[76]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Chao3">[79]</xref>, which does not report an estimated proportion of shared species (unless abundances of all species are equal). One reason why we concentrate on presence-absence (as opposed to including relative abundance data) is that inventories of spiders and other diverse arthropods typically employ an assortment of field sampling methods, each targeted to a subset of the fauna. Thus, the relative abundances of species sampled in this way are not expected to be representative of their actual abundances within communities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Longino3">[82]</xref>; random sampling of individuals from ecologically and morphologically diverse species communities in structurally complex habitats is usually not realistic. While species rarity is useful in the context of non-parametric species richness and shared species estimators, diversity measures that rely on community species abundance distributions (e.g., Chao's abundance-based Jaccard index) may be problematic in this context.</p>
<p>Chao's estimated proportional similarity is significantly correlated with both geographic and climatic distances (mantel tests; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). Nevertheless, it is clear that our understanding of regional and comparative β-diversity will greatly profit from an expanded dataset. In addition, future analyses involving more reconciled inventories should use variance partitioning to disentangle contributions of distance and climate to β-diversity pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Qian1">[48]</xref>. While acknowledging the preliminary nature of this analysis, to our knowledge this is the first quantification of the geographic rate of species turnover for tropical spider communities. Future analyses can also test for differences in the root causes of biodiversity structuring across landscapes. For example, data from angiosperms suggest stronger relationships between community similarity and geographic distance (as opposed to climate differences), suggesting a biodiversity pattern largely shaped by dispersal ability and climate history, particularly the Pleistocene glaciation of North America and Europe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Qian1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Qian2">[83]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Fitzpatrick1">[84]</xref>. We are curious if spiders and other megadiverse arthropod groups with comparatively narrow environmental tolerances and fast generation times follow a similar pattern, or if historical relicts such as glaciations are more quickly obliterated in such communities.</p>
<p>Similarly, there is an enduring interest in distinguishing the root causes of the spatial structuring of biodiversity (β-diversity). Concordance between community composition and environmental conditions suggest biodiversity structuring driven by niche-sorting, while concordance with geographic distance invokes dispersal abilities, landscape characteristics, and neutrality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Nekola1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Soininen1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Hubbell1">[85]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Novotny2">[90]</xref>. Whether the β-diversity patterns of spiders and other megadiverse arthropods accord or contrast with other communities of organisms, increased availability and analysis of data based on diverse taxa with fine-grained climatic and spatial structuring will contribute to a richer understanding of these fundamental biological questions. In addition, a more complete understanding of the spatial structure of megadiverse communities, including their geographic, climatic, and latitudinal components, can improve the targeting of conservation priorities and provide quantitative estimates of biodiversity structuring across the globe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-McKnight1">[91]</xref>. The cyberdiversity approach will help us to realize the full complement of scientific and conservation benefits offered by structured inventories of megadiverse taxa in a rapid and rigorous manner.</p>

To compare the optimized sampling strategy to the actual allocation of field hours, we reversed the order of samples (so efficient samples received high values) and plotted this reverse Cobra ranking against the number of actual field hours devoted to each method at each site. High points on the reverse Cobra ranking score indicate the sampling of maximum efficiency for contributing new species to an inventory; low points indicate sampling saturation (i.e., inefficiency for discovering new species). Efficient, unsaturated methods warrant more resources during field sampling.

Upper and lower bounds of the 95% confidence interval for V<sub>12(est)</sub> was used to estimate variability of the similarity measure.</p>

While it is common for distance-decay studies to estimate <italic>s</italic><sub>0</sub> and β using a linear regression of log(<italic>s</italic>) on distance, our dataset includes pairs of sites that have no species in common (<italic>s</italic> = 0), which results in an undefined portion of the regression (log(0) is not defined). While it is possible to add a small value to these zero-points during the calculation (or remove such comparisons from the model) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Nekola1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Soininen1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Qian1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Qian2">[83]</xref>, these manipulations result in meaningful changes to resulting estimates of <italic>s</italic><sub>0</sub> and β <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Millar1">[107]</xref>. Because community similarities range between 0 and 1, to include <italic>s</italic> = 0 site pairs, we, instead, modeled distance-decay as binomial proportions using a generalized linear model with a log link function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Millar1">[107]</xref>.</p>
<p>By parameterizing our exponential diversity-decay model, we gain two pieces of biological insight: (1) an estimate of the similarity of two samples taken from, essentially, the same locality (<italic>s</italic><sub>0</sub>; when <italic>d</italic> = 0), which provides some indication of sample completeness, underlying diversity, and habitat heterogeneity, and (2) the distance across which community similarity decays by half, (the “halving distance”, d<sub>0.5</sub>):<disp-formula id="pone.0115750.e004"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0115750.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>Because of the nature of exponential curves, this halving distance is independent of placement along the curve. Thus, we gain an estimate of a fundamental characteristic of species turnover along any stretch of space or climate across the sampled region.</p>
<p>Because our calculations are conducted on paired-comparisons, traditional estimates of model fit and standard errors of parameter estimates are not valid. Thus, we use a jackknife approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Millar1">[107]</xref> to calculate the standard error of parameter estimates. Our jackknife successively removes each of our <italic>n</italic> sites (not simply site-pairs) and re-runs our analyses <italic>n</italic> - 1 times.

Finally, we use mantel tests (using 10,000 permutations) to calculate the significance of relationships between community similarity and distance (geographic or climatic).</p>
<p>Climate data were obtained from the 30 arc second rasters of 19 bioclimatic variables and a digital elevation model from WorldClim (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldclim.org/current" xlink:type="simple">http://www.worldclim.org/current</ext-link>, generic global grids, version 1.4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115750-Hijmans1">[47]</xref>). While we are fundamentally interested in testing how changes in climate and elevation influence patterns of β-diversity, our current sample size is too small to exhaustively explore their impacts. Additionally, the available 19 BioClim climatic variables are highly autocorrelated (86% of the 190 pair-wise climate and elevation comparisons from Southeast Asian sites have a Pearson correlation greater than 0.5, 60% have correlations greater than or equal to 0.8). To summarize the available climate data into fewer variables, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA; Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115750.s001">S1 File</xref>). Climate data were log-transformed, mean-centered, and scaled prior to analysis. To calculate climatic distances among sites, we then calculated a Euclidean distance matrix using the scores from the first <italic>j</italic> principal component axes that cumulatively summarize more than 95% of the variance. Because geographic and climatic distance are expressed in different units, direct comparisons of d<sub>0.5</sub> are difficult, although comparisons of <italic>s</italic><sub>0</sub> between climate and geographic datasets are not affected.

<p>Logistical support for fieldwork was provided by the Institute of Ecology and Biological Resources, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology. Jan van Tol (Naturalis Biodiversity Center) and Le Xuan Canh (Institute of Ecology and Biological Resources) provided administrative support. We thank expedition participants Khuat Dang Long (Institute of Ecology and Biological Resources), Cees van Achterberg, Rob de Vries, Eric van Nieukerken, Eulàlia Gassó Miracle, and Camiel Doorenweerd (all Naturalis Biodiversity Center), and the staff and administrators of Cat Ba National Park, Cuc Phuong National Park, and Vu Quang National Park. Thanks to the Naturalis DNA barcoding lab (notably Camiel Doorenweerd and Frank Stokvis) for their hard work optimizing the DNA barcode pipeline. University of Leiden student interns Manon de Waard and Rense Schelfhorst generated many of the digital images. Additional DNA sequences were generated by Rense Schelfhorst. Deb Paul and Guillaume Jimenez helped facilitate the upload of images to Morphbank. Special thanks to the members of the Doi Inthanon inventory team, especially Martín Ramírez (Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales) and Facundo Labarque (California Academy of Sciences) for generously sharing their unpublished Doi Inthanon species abundance data, and for taking the initiative to post pictures of their morphospecies online. Thanks to Grace Woo (New Year Designs) for her major contributions to the web site, and to David Kavanaugh (California Academy of Sciences) for encouragement and critical discussions. We extend our appreciation to Martín Ramírez, Facundo Labarque, Peter Michalik (Universität Greifswald), an anonymous reviewer, and especially Pedro Cardoso (University of Helsinki) for constructive comments on manuscript drafts. Finally, we thank, and to Jonathan Coddington (Smithsonian Institution), Wayne Maddison (University of British Columbia), Anne Chao (National Tsing Hua University), Simon Rycroft and Laurence Livermore (The Natural History Museum, London) for helpful advice and discussion.</p>
