          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Helminth infections are proposed to have immunomodulatory activities affecting health outcomes either detrimentally or beneficially. We evaluated the effects of albendazole treatment, every three months for 21 months, on STH, malarial parasitemia and allergy.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods and Findings</title>
          <p>A household-based cluster-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in an area in Indonesia endemic for STH. Using computer-aided block randomization, 481 households (2022 subjects) and 473 households (1982 subjects) were assigned to receive placebo and albendazole, respectively, every three months. The treatment code was concealed from trial investigators and participants. Malarial parasitemia and malaria-like symptoms were assessed in participants older than four years of age while skin prick test (SPT) to allergens as well as reported symptoms of allergy in children aged 5–15 years. The general impact of treatment on STH prevalence and body mass index (BMI) was evaluated. Primary outcomes were prevalence of malarial parasitemia and SPT to any allergen. Analysis was by intention to treat. At 9 and 21 months post-treatment 80.8% and 80.1% of the study subjects were retained, respectively. The intensive treatment regiment resulted in a reduction in the prevalence of STH by 48% in albendazole and 9% in placebo group. Albendazole treatment led to a transient increase in malarial parasitemia at 6 months post treatment (OR 4.16(1.35–12.80)) and no statistically significant increase in SPT reactivity (OR 1.18(0.74–1.86) at 9 months or 1.37 (0.93–2.01) 21 months). No effect of anthelminthic treatment was found on BMI, reported malaria-like- and allergy symptoms. No adverse effects were reported.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>The study indicates that intensive community treatment of 3 monthly albendazole administration for 21 months over two years leads to a reduction in STH. This degree of reduction appears safe without any increased risk of malaria or allergies.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Soil transmitted helminths (STH) (hookworms, <italic>Ascaris lumbricoides</italic> and <italic>Trichuris trichiura</italic>) establish chronic infections in a large proportion of the world population.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Bethony1">[1]</xref> Major intervention programs using mass drug administration (MDA) to control STH have been launched.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Utzinger1">[2]</xref> However, STH infections seem to persist in the targeted populations raising concern over the development of drug resistance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Lustigman1">[3]</xref> It is therefore important to conduct well-designed studies that allow evidence-based decisions to be made to maximize effective STH control toward elimination.</p>
      <p>While there is no doubt that STH are associated with morbidities in billions of people worldwide, there is also increasing awareness that helminth infections might, like bacterial commensals, play an important role in shaping human health.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Allen1">[4]</xref> Helminths may contribute to immunologic and physiologic homeostasis. The immune system is thought to have evolved to operate optimally in the face of helminth-induced immune regulation, and that any disturbance of this long evolutionary co-existence between humans and helminth parasites might be associated with the emergence of pathological conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Maizels1">[5]</xref> possibly involving outcomes of exposure to other pathogens or the development of inflammatory diseases.</p>
      <p>In many parts of the world helminths and malarial parasites are co-endemic raising the question of what impact helminth infections may have on the plasmodial parasites that cause malaria. The results have been conflicting in this regard. In some studies a positive association has been reported between helminths and malarial parasitemia while in others, this has been refuted or in yet others a negative association has been shown between helminths and the severity of the clinical outcomes of malaria (reviewed by Nacher).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Nacher1">[6]</xref></p>
      <p>An increase in the prevalence of allergies has been reported worldwide, in particular in the urban areas of low- to middle-income countries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Bach1">[7]</xref> Although majority of cross-sectional studies have reported inverse associations between helminth infections and allergies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Feary1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Flohr1">[9]</xref>, two randomized trials with albendazole, have shown conflicting results. One in Ecuador, based on school randomization, reported no change in either SPT reactivity to allergens or allergic symptoms after one year of albendazole treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Cooper1">[10]</xref> while another in Vietnam, in which the randomization unit was individual schoolchildren, showed increased SPT reactivity after one year of albendazole treatment, but consistent with the Ecuadorean study, clinical allergy did not change significantly.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Flohr2">[11]</xref> It has been suggested that anthelminthic treatment of longer duration might be needed to reveal the modulatory effect of helminths.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Endara1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Lau1">[13]</xref></p>
      <p>In the light of global deworming initiatives, it is important to assess the effectiveness of and to monitor the risks associated with anthelminthic treatment regiments. There is as yet no report of a household-based cluster-randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of repeated anthelminthic administration in a community that would be expected to more effectively reduce transmission of STH by decreasing household cross-contamination.</p>
      <p>In an area where STH and malaria are co-endemic on Flores Island, Indonesia, we conducted a household cluster-randomized trial of three-monthly albendazole treatment over a two year study period in a whole community to assess benefits and risks associated with this anthelmintic treatment. Specifically we assessed its impact on STH, malarial parasitemia and allergy.</p>

        <title>Study population and design</title>
        <p>This trial was conducted in two villages in the Ende District of Flores Island, Indonesia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057899.s001">Appendix S1</xref>, p2) as described in detail elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Hamid1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Wiria1">[15]</xref> The treatment was based on household and given to all household members except those less than two years old or pregnant (the Indonesian national program guideline). Directly observed treatment was given three monthly during the trial period (June 2008 to July 2010, with treatment starting in Sept 2008). The primary outcomes were prevalence of malarial parasitemia and SPT reactivity to allergens. Additional outcomes were treatment effect on STH and BMI as well as malaria-like and allergy symptoms.</p>
        <p>We measured malaria outcomes in Nangapanda only. Malaria was not endemic in Anaranda. Artemisinin-combination therapy (ACT) treatment and treated bed net distribution were not implemented during our study period.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Harijanto1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Elyazar1">[17]</xref></p>
        <p>Allergy outcomes were measured, in both villages, in school-age children (5–15 years old) as this group is particularly at risk of developing allergy and asthma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Szefler1">[18]</xref> and is the target population of global deworming programs.</p>
        <p>The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Medical Faculty, University of Indonesia (ethical clearance ref: 194/PT02.FK/Etik/2006) and filed by the Committee of Medical Ethics of the Leiden University Medical Center. The trial was registered as clinical trial (Ref: ISRCTN83830814). Prior to the study, written informed consent was obtained from participants or from parents/guardians of children. The study is reported in accordance with the CONSORT guidelines for cluster-randomized studies. The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057899.s002">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057899.s003">Protocol S1</xref>.</p>

        <title>Randomization and masking</title>
        <p>The population was randomized by IA using computer aided block randomization at household level utilising Random Allocation software to receive albendazole (single dose of 400 mg) or a matching placebo (both tablets from PT Indofarma Pharmaceutical, Bandung, Indonesia). The treatment code was concealed from trial investigators and participants. The un-blinding of treatment codes occurred after all laboratory results had been entered into the database (August 2011).</p>

        <title>Procedures</title>
        <p>Trained community workers measured fever, administered monthly malaria-like symptoms questionnaire which was based on WHO definitions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-World1">[19]</xref> and took finger-prick blood for the three-monthly malarial parasitemia survey. Subjects with fever (≥37.5°C) or additional malaria-like symptoms (headache, fatigue and nausea) at the time of visits were referred to the local primary health centre (puskesmas). Thick and thin Giemsa-stained blood smears were read at University of Indonesia. At baseline, 9 months and 21 months after the first round of treatment blood was collected for PCR-based detection of <italic>Plasmodium spp.</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057899.s001">Appendix S1</xref>, p2), a method that is more sensitive than microscopy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Adegnika1">[20]</xref></p>
        <p>Regarding allergy outcomes, skin prick tests (SPT) with allergens were performed on school-age children in Nangapanda and Anaranda and clinical symptoms of allergy were recorded. House dust mite (<italic>Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus</italic> and <italic>D. farinae</italic>; kindly provided by Paul van Rijn from HAL Allergy Laboratories, Leiden, The Netherlands) and cockroach (<italic>Blatella germanica</italic>; Lofarma, Milan, Italy) were used for SPT which was considered positive with 3 mm cut off.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Hamid1">[14]</xref> The SPT was performed by one investigator. IgE with specificity for aeroallergens (<italic>D. pteronyssinus</italic> and <italic>B. germanica</italic>) was measured in plasma using an ImmunoCAP 250 system (Phadia, Uppsala, Sweden) following the manufacturer's instructions. All measurements were conducted in one laboratory in the Netherlands. Symptoms of asthma and atopic dermatitis were recorded using a modified visually-assisted version of the International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire as reported before.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Hamid1">[14]</xref></p>
        <p>Yearly stool samples were collected on a voluntary basis. <italic>Trichuris</italic> was detected by microscopy and a multiplex real-time PCR was used for detection of hookworms (<italic>Ancylostoma duodenale</italic>, <italic>Necator americanus)</italic>, <italic>Ascaris lumbricoides</italic>, and <italic>Strongyloides stercoralis</italic> DNA as detailed before<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Wiria1">[15]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057899.s001">Appendix S1</xref>, p2). Very few subjects were infected with <italic>S. stercoralis</italic> and therefore this infection was not included in analyses.</p>
        <p>Body weight and height were measured using the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute practical guidelines (scale and microtoise from SECA GmBH &amp; Co, Hamburg, Germany).</p>

      <sec id="s2d">
        <title>Power calculation</title>
        <p>Sample size estimation was based on the expected change in primary outcomes taking into account a power of 90% and a significance level of &lt;0.05 with a loss to follow-up of 20%. Based on previous observations we expected to find a decrease in malarial parasitemia prevalence and an increase in SPT reactivity after anthelminthic treatment. Based on a prevalence of about 10% and a risk ratio (RR) of 0.60 we aimed to include 2412 people in the malaria assessments. In a pilot study we found SPT to <italic>D. pteronyssinus</italic> to be around 15%, and expected that due to treatment the prevalence would increase. In order to find a RR of 1.5 we aimed to include at least 1418 children.</p>

        <title>Statistical analyses</title>
        <p>For children ≤19 years, BMI age-standardized z-scores were calculated according to WHO references.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-WHO1">[21]</xref> The IgE data were log-transformed to obtain normally distributed variable. To assess treatment effects generalized linear mixed models were used which provide a flexible and powerful tool to derive valid inference while capturing the data correlations induced by clustering within households and repeated evaluations in time of the same subject. Parameter estimates for treatment effects at 9 and 21 months and 95% confidence intervals are reported. The reported p-values are obtained using likelihood ratio tests by comparing the model with and without the treatment effect. Unless stated otherwise all outcomes were adjusted for area (the two study villages in Ende District: Nangapanda or Anaranda) as covariate in the model. For the continuous outcomes (linear mixed-effects models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Laird1">[22]</xref> were used with three random effects, namely to model clustering within households a random household specific intercept was used and to model correlation within subjects a random subject specific intercept and slope were used. For the binary outcomes a logistic model was used with random household effects and random subject effects. All models were fitted using the lme4 package (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057899.s001">Appendix S1</xref>, p6-7).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Rforge1">[23]</xref> For each fever and additional malaria-like symptoms, total number of events and person months are computed for each treatment arm. Hazard ratios for effect of treatment were calculated with Cox regression with robust SE to allow for within-household clustering (STATA 11).</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>At baseline, 954 households with 4004 subjects were registered. Randomization of households resulted in 1982 people assigned to albendazole treatment and 2022 people to placebo (473 and 481 houses respectively). At baseline 87·3% of the individuals were infected with one or more helminth species. The baseline characteristics were similar between the treatment arms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0057899-t001">table 1</xref>). The overall trial profile is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057899-g001">figure 1</xref>, and figure S1A, S1B, S1C (p13–15) in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057899.s001">Appendix S1</xref> separately for malaria, allergy and helminth outcomes. The analysis was intention-to-treat and involved all participants as assigned randomly at the start of the trial. During the study, in the albendazole arm 61 people moved to a house that was assigned to placebo while in the placebo arm 62 people moved to a house that was assigned to albendazole. The 44 subjects who died during the trial, included 4 people below the age of 20, 3 between 20 and 40 and the rest above 40 years of age, and were equally distributed between the treatment arms. At 9 months post-treatment full compliance was 77.8% for albendazole treatment and 78.0% for placebo. This was 63.1% and 62.5% respectively at 21 months.</p>

      <p>This intensive treatment with albendazole resulted in a reduction but not elimination of STH. There was a decrease both after 9 (OR (95% CI) = 0.07 (0.04–0.11) and 21 months (0.05 (0.03–0.08)) of treatment (p&lt;0.0001). Albendazole had the largest effect on hookworm followed by <italic>Ascaris</italic> while the effect on <italic>Trichuris</italic> was less pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057899-g002">figure 2A</xref> and table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057899.s001">Appendix S1</xref> p8). Treatment also led to statistically significant reduction in the intensity of hookworm and <italic>Ascaris</italic> infection as determined by PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057899-g002">figure 2B</xref>). The fact that the stool sampling was on a voluntary basis could have created a selection bias. Analyzing baseline characteristics of subjects providing stool samples and those who did not at 9 months follow up, showed no differences in helminth prevalence, age and sex. Although at 21 months post treatment, sex and helminth prevalence were not different, age was slightly but significantly higher in subjects who provided stool samples mean age in years (SD) = 29.9 (20.4) vs 24.3 (17.5), p = 0.006)</p>

      <p>The overall percentage of subjects with malarial parasitemia, irrespective of treatment arm, decreased over the trial period (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0057899-t002">table 2</xref>). However, when the data were modelled to assess the effect of albendazole treatment over time, there was a significant (P = 0.0064) increase, which might result from the transient four-fold increased risk of malarial parasitemia (OR 4.16 (1.35–12.80)) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0057899-t003">table 3</xref>) at 6 months after initiation of treatment (after 2 doses of albendazole). The effect of anthelminthic treatment was assessed in those younger than 15 years of age who would be the prime target of the global deworming programs. The transient increase in parasitemia was only seen in the older (&gt;15 years) age group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057899-g003">figure 3</xref>). Malarial parasites were also assessed by PCR, at 9 and 21 months after initiation of treatment and revealed that albendazole had no effect when all <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species were considered together, but when analyzed separately there was a significant increase in the percentage of subjects positive for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> at 9 months post-treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0057899-t004">table 4</xref>).

      <p>The proportion of subjects with SPT reactivity was 353/1364 (25.9%) at baseline. Albendazole treatment had no statistically significant effect on SPT to any allergen (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0057899-t005">table 5</xref>), but it was noted that there was an incremental increase in the risk of being SPT positive to any allergen at 9 months and 21 months post initiation of treatment. Moreover, additional analysis on allergens separately, showed a significantly higher SPT to cockroach at 21 months after treatment (1.63 (1.07–2.50)) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0057899-t006">table 6</xref>). The levels of IgE to allergens showed that albendazole treatment had no effect (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0057899-t006">table 6</xref>). No effect of treatment was seen on symptoms of asthma or atopic dermatitis (table S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057899.s001">Appendix S1</xref> p11).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This household-based clustered-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial shows that administering a total of seven single doses of albendazole, at three-monthly intervals, to a population living in an area of Indonesia where STH are highly prevalent, leads to decreased prevalence of helminth infections which although statistically significant, can be taken as an incomplete reduction. The results show a transient increase in malarial parasitemia in the albendazole- compared with the placebo-treated arm in the first six months after initiation of treatment. Albendazole treatment had no statistically significant effect on the designated co-primary outcome, skin prick test reactivity to allergens.</p>
      <p>The clinical data collected of fever and additional malaria-like symptoms, were not affected by the deworming. Clinical signs of asthma and atopic dermatitis were also not affected by albendazole treatment.</p>
      <p>The prevalence of infection was high (&gt;60%), which reflects the situation in many areas that are being targeted by the global deworming programs. Using a three-monthly treatment regimen which represents an extreme scenario for helminth control strategy, percentage of subjects positive for STH was reduced by 39% compared to placebo. It should be noted that in our study the sensitive PCR method has been used. The reduction in the proportion of subjects infected with hookworm and <italic>Ascaris</italic> was more pronounced than for <italic>Trichuris</italic> infections, confirming the findings using a single dose of albendazole.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Keiser1">[24]</xref> Subjects who provided stool samples at 21 months were slightly but significantly older than those who did not. Given that hookworm infection is more prevalent in older subjects, this may have contributed to the poor deworming achieved by albendazole. The reduction achieved in worm loads, did not have any beneficial effect on BMI. Observational studies have reported that helminth infections affect growth; however randomized trials have not been consistent.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Alderman1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Dickson1">[26]</xref> In this regard, our study would support the outcome of a recent Cochrane review of no beneficial effect of deworming programs on nutritional indicators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-TaylorRobinson1">[27]</xref> even though it can be argued that in our study the suboptimal reduction in the STH would not allow any beneficial effect of anthelmintic in terms of BMI to be seen in the community. Importantly, the fact that the effect of such an intensive deworming strategy in a community is incomplete, needs to be considered in the agenda for the control and elimination of helminth diseases of humans.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Prichard1">[28]</xref></p>
      <p>Most studies on the effect of helminth infections on malarial parasitemia and clinical malaria episodes have used cross-sectional designs and have been inconclusive.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Nacher1">[6]</xref> Longitudinal studies of anthelminthic treatment have also reported conflicting results.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Brutus1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Kirwan1">[30]</xref> A small study conducted in Madagascar<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Brutus1">[29]</xref> has reported an increase in malarial parasitemia in levimasole treated subjects, older than 5 years of age, while in Nigeria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Kirwan1">[30]</xref>, albendazole treatment of pre school children was associated with lower <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection and anemia, however, the lost to follow up in this study was very high. The question whether albendazole treatment during pregnancy could affect health outcomes in the offspring, was addressed in a recent report from Uganda.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Webb1">[31]</xref> It was found that the incidence of malaria up to one years of age was not different in the offspring of mothers born to those treated with albendazole or placebo. Our study, reports the results of a community wide randomized-controlled trial that used three-monthly malarial parasitemia data obtained by microscopy. A significantly higher percentage of subjects positive for malarial parasites in the albendazole compared to the placebo arm was seen but this seemed to be a transient effect and restricted to individuals older than 15 years of age, an age group that is not the main target of the current deworming programs. The question arises as to why this effect was only seen in those &gt;15 years of age. This could be due to the fact that <italic>Ascaris</italic> infection is lower in older age and therefore more easily cleared. It has been suggested that <italic>Ascaris</italic> is the spesies of helminth that has the most effect on malarial parasitemia and diseases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Nacher1">[6]</xref> Therefore by removing <italic>Ascaris</italic> in older age, we might be seeing a more profound effect on malarial parasitemia.</p>
      <p>Using PCR, which enables detection of sub-microscopic infections at species level, it was also concluded that albendazole did not affect overall malarial parasitemia. When malaria species were analyzed separately, the percentage of subjects infected with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> but not with <italic>P. vivax</italic> increased significantly in the first 9 months post-treatment in the albendazole-treated arm, which is contrary to our hypothesis that anthelminthic treatment would reduce prevalence of malarial parasitemia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Specht1">[32]</xref> It was expected that by decreasing STH, the immune hyporesponsiveness would be reversed and this would be associated with stronger immune effector responses to malaria parasites. One of the possible explanations for the enhanced malarial parasitemia would be that with a reduction in STH, there is increased nutrient availability for other co infections and their growth.</p>
      <p>It has been suggested that there are different malaria outcomes with different species of helminths; <italic>Ascaris</italic> being associated with protection regarding parasitemia and severity of malaria while hookworm with higher incidence of malaria.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Nacher1">[6]</xref> Our study was not powered to conduct a stratified analysis, and with the overall gradual decrease in malaria in the study area during our study, the numbers of subjects positive for malaria parasites are too few for an ad hoc analysis.</p>
      <p>The findings concerning allergy outcomes, although not significant, are in line with our hypothesis that anthelminthic treatment would increase SPT reactivity. The risk of SPT reactivity increased incrementally with longer treatment and raises the question whether even longer deworming periods are needed for more pronounced effects on allergic outcomes. In support of this, a recent study reported that 15–17 years of ivermectin treatment for onchocerciasis control in Ecuador led to a significant increase in SPT reactivity to allergens.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Endara1">[12]</xref> In the same country, one year of anthelmintic treatment in schoolchildren did not lead to any change in SPT.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Cooper1">[10]</xref> The question whether different species of helminths might affect allergic outcomes to a different degree, remains unanswered. It is interesting that a one year anthelmintic treatment in Vietnam where hookworm infection was the prominent species, as in our study, resulted in a significant increase in SPT positivity in schoolchildren. This is in contrast to what was seen in Ecuador where <italic>Ascaris lumbricoides</italic> was the most prevalent species. One common feature of the anthelmintic trials seems to be that clinical symptoms of allergy do not change with deworming. However, an important trial in pregnant women in Uganda has shown an increased risk of infantile eczema in infants of mothers treated with anthelminthics compared to those that received placebo.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Mpairwe1">[33]</xref> This could indicate that exposure to worms in early life, might affect allergic outcomes more profoundly than when helminths are removed later in life.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057899-Djuardi1">[34]</xref></p>
      <p>One of the limitations of this trial is the overall decrease in malarial parasitemia during the two year study period, most probably caused by actively referring subjects with malaria-like symptoms to puskesmas. Therefore further studies in areas highly endemic for malaria are needed. Treatment in the trial did result in a significant reduction in percentage of subjects infected with STH, but this reduction was incomplete. It is therefore possible that the community was insufficiently dewormed. However, our primary aim was to measure the possible effect of deworming programmes on malaria or allergy. We conclude that despite transient increase in malarial parasitemia as a result of albendazole treatment, there were no clinically relevant changes to outcome measures 21 months after treatment was initiated.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, an extremely intensive anthelminthic treatment in a community where STH are highly endemic, does not lead to elimination but reduces both prevalence and intensity of helminths. Such MDA regiment appears safe and does not lead to any significant change with respect to malaria infections or allergies. However, it is worrying that such vigorous community treatment does not have a more pronounced effect on STH burden. Better integrated control strategies would be needed to deworm and subsequently assess whether the risk for malaria infections or allergies change.</p>
