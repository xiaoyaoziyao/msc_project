          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Overall, 454 researchers participated. They considered publication bias a problem in animal research (7 (5 to 8)) and thought that about 50% (32‚Äì70) of animal experiments are published. Employees (n‚Ää=‚Ää21) of for-profit organizations estimated that 10% (5 to 50) are published. Lack of statistical significance (4 (4 to 5)), technical problems (4 (3 to 4)), supervisors (4 (3 to 5)) and peer reviewers (4 (3 to 5)) were considered important reasons for non-publication (all on 5-point scales). Respondents thought that mandatory publication of study protocols and results, or the reasons why no results were obtained, may increase scientific progress but expected increased bureaucracy. These opinions did not depend on size of the animal used, seniority of the respondent or type of research.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>Non-publication of ‚Äúnegative‚Äù results appears to be prevalent in laboratory animal research. If statistical significance is indeed a main driver of publication, the collective literature on animal experimentation will be biased. This will impede the performance of valid literature syntheses. Effective, yet efficient systems should be explored to counteract selective reporting of laboratory animal research.</p>

      <p>Publication bias jeopardizes evidence-based medicine through biased literature syntheses of clinical studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-Vedula1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-Turner1">[2]</xref> It is conceivable that non-publication practices affect laboratory animal research too.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-Hackam1">[3]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-Sena1">[6]</xref> In particular, non-reporting of ‚Äúnegative‚Äù research findings may hamper progress in laboratory animal research (LAR) through unnecessary duplications of experiments and may lead to premature first-in-man studies. Data on the extent of non-publication in LAR is scarce.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-Mignini1">[7]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-Korevaar1">[10]</xref> Historically, the outlook on publishing may be different between clinical and laboratory animal research. For example, in his book ‚ÄòIntroduction √† l'√©tude de la medicine experimentale‚Äô, the founding father of experimental physiology, Claude Bernard, argued that ‚Äú<italic>[.] in physiology we must never make average descriptions of experiments because the true relations of phenomena disappear in the average; [.] we must [.] present our most perfect experiment as a type‚Äù</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-Bernard1">[11]</xref> More recently, Lemon and Dunnett, arguing against the use of systematic reviews for LAR, wrote that <italic>‚Äúno mechanism exists for so called negative results to be published. [.]. This is not just an issue of publication bias [.]. Scientific experiments are designed to test for evidence in favour of a particular experimental hypothesis and to abandon it if insufficient evidence is acquired.‚Äù</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-Lemon1">[12]</xref> Against this background, we assessed laboratory animal researchers‚Äô opinions about magnitude, drivers, consequences and potential solutions for publication bias in The Netherlands (575,278 animals used in experiments in 2010) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-MinisterievanEconomischeZakenLandbouwen1">[13]</xref>. We explored the impact of animal size, researcher seniority, working in a for-profit organization and type of research on those opinions.</p>

      <title>Methods</title>
      <p>We approached respondents via a two-step procedure: (i) the Dutch professional association of animal welfare officers, and (ii) all animal welfare officers. In March 2011, we sent a standard letter of invitation to participate by email to all animal welfare officers in the Netherlands via one liaison person (ML) who had access to them through their professional association. Since the animal welfare officers have address lists of all researchers that (had) performed LAR in their institutes, they were asked to send the invitation letter to all their animal researchers. The invitation letters () contained the link to the internet-based survey and explained that confidentiality was guaranteed for the respondent and their institute. In the months prior to the survey‚Äôs launch, two authors (GtR and LH) had secured informal commitment to the survey from animal welfare officers in ten institutes.</p>
      <p>The survey (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043404.s005">Appendix S2</xref>) addressed five background features: (i) field of expertise, (ii) affiliation, (iii) size of the animals used [small (e.g. birds, rodents, fish, amphibians, reptiles) versus large (otherwise) or both], (iv) seniority of the respondent, as expressed by the number of (co-)authored publications, and (v) the type of the research of the respondent, where we defined pre-clinical research as LAR to investigate if a drug, procedure or treatment may have an effect in humans; other research was deemed basic. These background variables were also used in one-way stratified analyses to assess if results varied by these variables. The estimates for the publication rates were analyzed using bootstrapped quantile regression (200 repetitions) to adjust for the simultaneous effects of the four stratification variables. Items were scored on 5 or 10 point scales, in which 1 indicated totally unimportant and 5 or 10 extremely important.</p>
      <p>We used Surveymonkey software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.surveymonkey.com" xlink:type="simple">www.surveymonkey.com</ext-link>) and STATA software (version 10.1). Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests (in combination with Tukey‚Äôs post-hoc test) were used to assess statistical significance (alpha‚Ää=‚Ää0.05). We applied the Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple testing.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>Through the Dutch professional association of animal welfare officers, all animal welfare officers (n‚Ää=‚Ää39) received the invitation letter and an internet link for the survey. We estimate that between 2,000 and 3,500 laboratory animal researchers received the invitation to participate. Between 17 March and 30 July 2011, 474 (between 14‚Äì24%) laboratory animal researchers returned the survey. Fifty-one respondents did not fill in the survey completely. Of these, we excluded 20 because of absence of (at least) their background data. This left 454 participants for the analysis. The variation in the number of respondents across <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0043404-t001">table 1</xref> is caused by the other 31 respondents.</p>

On average, those working in not-for-profit institutes (n‚Ää=‚Ää421) estimated that 50 percent (interquartile range (IQR) 35 to 70) of all conducted laboratory animal experiments are published. Researchers in a for-profit environment (n‚Ää=‚Ää21) estimated that only 10 percent (5 to 50) is published. Researchers in not-for-profit institutes reported that 80 percent (60 to 90) of their own work had been published against 10 percent (5 to 39) of the work of researchers in a for-profit environment. Respondents working only with large animals thought that their own work was published in 90 percent of cases (79 to 100) against 75 percent (50 to 90) for those working with small animals only. Results from the multivariable analyses change these results only slightly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043404.s002">Tables S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043404.s003">S3</xref>). In particular, respondents who had co-authored more than 5 papers estimated publication rates 10 percentage points higher than respondents who had published less (95% CI from 0.8 to 19.1). Respondents working with large animals only estimated the publication rate of work they had been involved in personally 10 percentage points higher (95% CI from 1.1 to 18.9). Statistical non-significance and technical problems are considered to be the main drivers for non-publication. Supervisors, editors, and reviewers were considered responsible for non-publication. As expected, funders were considered more important in a for-profit environment (2 versus 4). Overall, respondents considered publication bias an important problem for LAR (7 (IQR 5‚Äì8)) and for research duplication, literature syntheses and well-timed initiation of phase-1clinical trials in humans in particular. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0043404-t001">Table 1</xref> shows that respondents thought mandatory publication of study protocols or results may help avoid unnecessary duplication, increase validity of literature syntheses and scientific progress, but at the cost of increased bureaucracy. These opinions did not depend on size of the animal used, seniority of the respondent or type of research.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Publication bias is an important problem in laboratory animal research (LAR) according to laboratory animal researchers. We estimate that only fifty percent of LAR is published, but it may be far less in for-profit organizations given that their employees estimated that only ten percent of LAR gets published overall, including their own. Lack of statistical significance, technical problems, the opinions of supervisors and peer reviewers were considered important drivers of non-publication. Respondents thought that mandatory publication of study protocols, research results or the reasons why results could not be obtained may accelerate scientific progress.</p>
      <p>To our knowledge, this is the first survey among laboratory animal researchers focusing on publication bias. This survey has several limitations. First, we estimate the response rate to this survey to be between 14 and 24 percent. We do not know to which extent the results are representative for the Dutch LAR community, let alone for the wider LAR community. The number of laboratory animal researchers in The Netherlands is unknown. We were unable to obtain exact information from the institutes on to the number of E-mail addresses to which the survey had been sent. Another difficulty is that such address lists may not always be fully up to date. In particular, researchers who retire or change jobs may be listed in error. Second, the survey was restricted to one country. Third, only few researchers in for-profit organizations participated. Fourth, our results are reminiscent of the joke about surveys on driving ability in which 90% of respondents think that they belong to the group of people whose driving abilities are above-average. Likewise, it seems somewhat paradoxical that our respondents estimate the publication rate of their own work as much higher (in theory, they could have calculated it) than the overall rate. Another explanation may be that the 50% rate mentioned in the introduction to the survey acted as an anchor that made respondents estimate the overall rates as too low. That would imply that a non-publication rate of 20% is closer to the truth. This issue is related to the next one. Fifth, our study investigated researchers‚Äô opinions, which may not reflect the true rate(s) of non-publication. Sixth, due to the large number of statistical significance tests (n‚Ää=‚Ää121), application of the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (at alpha‚Ää=‚Ää0.05) implies that only p-values below 0.0004 should be considered statistically significant (see also the legend to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043404.s001">Table S1</xref>). The assessment of the effects of the four stratification variables should be considered explorative. Seventh, we were unable to assess the impact of scientific sub-discipline on the results since the free text field (survey item A.1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043404.s005">Appendix S2</xref>) yielded imprecise data with large variation.</p>
      <p>Data on non-publication rates in LAR are scarce. Sena et al, using the statistical ‚Äútrim and fill‚Äù technique on a large number of animal experiments on acute ischemic stroke, estimated the non-publication rate to be 13.6 percent which was associated with a 30% overstatement of efficacy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-Sena1">[6]</xref> Evidence from clinical research on humans suggests that between 46 and 67 percent of studies are not published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-Easterbrook1">[14]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-Rothstein1">[17]</xref>, and that in those published, positive findings are over-emphasized. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-Mathieu1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-Boutron1">[19]</xref> The emergence of trial registration, and the joint statement of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors on publication of randomized trials being conditional on a trial having a public trial registration number may have reduced these numbers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-DeAngelis1">[20]</xref> We agree with Sena et al who argued that ‚Äúnon-publication is unethical since it deprives researchers of the accurate data they need to estimate the potential of novel therapies in clinical trials, but also because the included animals are wasted because they do not contribute to accumulating knowledge. In addition, research syntheses that overstate effects may lead to further unnecessary animal experiments testing poorly founded hypotheses.‚Äù <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-Sena1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Measures against the suppression of ‚Äúnegative‚Äù results can be categorized from the source, via upstream to more downstream measures. Since, in The Netherlands, all experiments must pass a Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) for ethics approval, IACUCs may play a crucial role in the registration of all LAR and prevention of publication bias. A system ensuring periodic follow-up of each experiment‚Äôs fate would reinforce such registration. It may be challenging to build a watertight system that simultaneously minimizes bureaucracy. Application of modern information technology may be crucial. One option to prevent that study results have an effect on the editorial decision is to initially submit manuscripts without any results. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-Greenland1">[21]</xref> Editors and peer reviewers would judge the importance of submissions through the background, hypotheses and methods sections. This would ensure that acceptance is not conditional on the results. More downstream measures include special journals, journal sections or repositories for ‚Äúnegative‚Äù results, such as the Journal of Negative Results in Biomedicine, The All Results Journals and Negative Results in Gynecological Oncology. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-Knight1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-The1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-Journal1">[23]</xref> In addition, two journals, the Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism and Neurobiology of Aging, feature Negative Results sections with a very similar flavor. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-Journal2">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-Neurobiology1">[25]</xref> The Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism describes this section as follows: ‚ÄúNegative Results is intended to provide a forum for data that did not substantiate [.] a difference between the experimental groups, and/or did not reproduce published findings. Since the net effect of a Negative Result is to discourage repetition, the standards for acceptance as a Negative Result will be highly demanding. Typically, Type II error considerations are mandatory.‚Äù <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-Journal2">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Statistical significance testing is probably a main driver of non-publication. This is especially unfortunate given the widespread errors involved in understanding the meaning of p-values.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-Goodman1">[26]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-Goodman3">[28]</xref>.</p>
      <p>What are the implications for further research? As we have learnt from randomized trials in humans, follow-up of cohorts of study protocols may help us understand the magnitude and the causes of publication bias in LAR, which in turn may affect the research community‚Äôs motivation to deal with it. In the meantime, more research into statistical correction of publication bias seems useful.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-Egger1">[29]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-Bennett1">[31]</xref> Specifically, the comparison of various methods to deal with publication bias statistically, such as the trim and fill <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-Duval1">[32]</xref>, regression-based methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-Moreno1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-Moreno2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-Moreno3">[34]</xref>, and capture-recapture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043404-Bennett1">[31]</xref> may be compared in simulation studies to assess their strengths and weaknesses in various situations.</p>
