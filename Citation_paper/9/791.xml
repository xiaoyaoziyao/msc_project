<title>Background</title>
<p>Some conduct-disordered youths have high levels of callous unemotional traits and meet the DSM-5’s “with limited prosocial emotions” (LPE) specifier. These youths often do aggressive, self-benefitting acts that cost others. We previously developed a task, the AlAn’s game, which asks participants to repeatedly decide whether to accept or reject offers in which they will receive money but a planned charity donation will be reduced. In our prior work, more "costly helping" (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., rejecting the offered money and protecting the donation) was associated with lower callous unemotional traits. Here we extend that prior work in a larger sample of adolescent male patients with serious conduct problems and controls, and test whether this association is mediated specifically by a Moral Elevation response (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., a positive emotional response to another’s act of virtue).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The adolescent male participants were: 45 patients (23 with LPE) and 26 controls, who underwent an extensive phenotypic assessment including a measure of Moral Elevation. About 1 week later participants played the AlAn’s game.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Results</title>
<p>All AlAn’s game outcomes demonstrated significant group effects: (1) money taken for self (p = 0.02); (2) money left in the charitable donation (p = 0.03); and, (3) costly helping (p = 0.047). Controls took the least money and did the most costly helping, while patients with LPE took the most money and did the least costly helping. Groups also significantly differed in post-stimulus Moral Elevation scores (p = 0.005). Exploratory analyses supported that the relationship between callous unemotional traits and costly helping on the AlAn’s game may be mediated in part by differences in Moral Elevation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec004">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The AlAn's game provides a standardized behavioral measure associated with callous unemotional traits. Adolescents with high levels of callous unemotional traits engage in fewer costly helping behaviors, and those differences may be related to blunting of positive emotional responses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Conduct disorder, characterized by aggression to people and animals, rule breaking, lying and conning others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref001">1</xref>], is common, affecting about 6–10% of U.S. adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref003">3</xref>]. Youths with conduct disorder are very likely to try alcohol and illicit substances early in life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref004">4</xref>], to develop early-onset substance use disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref005">5</xref>], and to engage in HIV-risk behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref006">6</xref>]. This group has high rates of mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref011">11</xref>], represents a major source of violent behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref013">13</xref>], is likely to be incarcerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref015">15</xref>], and is very costly to society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref016">16</xref>]. However, conduct disorder is a heterogenous phenotype. About 40% of such children will develop an adult diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder, but more than half will not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref017">17</xref>], with some apparently remitting from their problem behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref018">18</xref>]. Given this heterogeneity, several strategies have been employed to subtype conduct-disordered youths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref019">19</xref>], and in recent years a large body of research has focused on callous-unemotional traits. Callous unemotional traits describe individuals who show a callous lack of empathy, who lack remorse or guilt, who are unconcerned about their performance, and who exhibit shallow or deficient affect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref001">1</xref>]. Children with conduct disorder and high callous unemotional traits display more aggressive behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref020">20</xref>], tend to be more refractory to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref022">22</xref>] and have more persistent courses of their antisocial behavior problems[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref020">20</xref>]. Thus, conduct disorder plus high callous unemotional traits may represent an important subtype of conduct disorder, prompting the inclusion of a “with limited prosocial emotions” (LPE) specifier to the conduct disorder diagnosis in DSM-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref001">1</xref>].</p>
<p>Several models have been proposed to explain high rates of aggressive and violent behavior among psychopathic individuals and children with LPE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref024">24</xref>]. One recent influential model by Blair and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref026">26</xref>] proposes that emotional differences undergird behavioral differences. Youths with LPE demonstrate a “deafness” to displays of sadness and fear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref028">28</xref>], are less reactive to pain experienced by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref029">29</xref>], and are less responsive to distress cues of others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref030">30</xref>]. Therefore, when others display fear, sadness, pain and/or distress, those with LPE lack emotional cues that would guide them to restrain aggressive and antisocial behaviors. In contrast, those with conduct disorder without LPE are proposed to exhibit quick and exaggerated emotional responses to perceived perturbations (e.g., threat) that drive reactive aggressive behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref025">25</xref>]. These differences in emotional reactivity then are proposed to mediate the link between conduct disorder, LPE and aggressive antisocial behaviors.</p>
<p>Youths with serious conduct problems also differ in prosocial behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref031">31</xref>]. However, more limited research has been designed to examine these behavioral differences. Nonetheless, Blair's model might be extended to posit that differences in prosocial behaviors are mediated by differences in other emotional domains, such as positive emotions. One likely candidate positive emotion that might influence prosocial behaviors is Moral Elevation. According to Algoe &amp; Haidt, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref032">32</xref>] people may experience a positive response to another’s act “of charity, gratitude, fidelity, generosity or any other strong display of virtue”. This reaction may occur even though the observer is not involved in, and does not benefit from, these positive behaviors. Haidt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref033">33</xref>] carefully outlined a constellation of emotional, physical and psychological aspects of a Moral Elevation response. To date it has been demonstrated that Moral Elevation can be elicited with stimulus stories or videos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref032">32</xref>], that the Moral Elevation response can be measured with questionnaires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref035">35</xref>], and that the experience of Moral Elevation is associated with subsequent prosocial and affiliative behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref032">32</xref>]. Here for the first time, we examine whether reductions in Moral Elevation may characterize the behavior of youth with serious conduct problems and LPE, as compared to youth with serious conduct problems but without LPE, or youth without such problems.</p>
<p>Although many studies use self-reports to examine outcomes of interest (aggressive or prosocial behavior), laboratory-based behavioral measures may have certain advantages, given that conduct disorder is characterized by lying. Considering this, we developed and pilot tested a behavioral measure, the AlAn’s game, and demonstrated that game outcomes are associated with severity of callous unemotional traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref036">36</xref>]. The rationale for the task derived from prior work on costly punishment among other related concepts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref041">41</xref>]. This work has shown that individuals, when asked to consider a benefit to themselves and/or a benefit to another, are not simply driven by self-interest, but instead are willing to impose punishment on “bad actors” even when there is a cost to themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref042">42</xref>]. This common human tendency, called "costly punishment", has been demonstrated worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref043">43</xref>] and has been proposed as an important mechanism of social cooperation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref044">44</xref>]. In contrast, giving is increased when directed toward an agent generally considered to be “deserving” or beneficent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref041">41</xref>]. Drawing from the work of Moll et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref039">39</xref>] we designed the AlAn’s game where the player must simultaneously consider a benefit to themselves and a cost to a charity that is generally considered beneficent. The AlAn’s game makes a series of offers in which players will receive money but a planned charitable donation will be reduced; players must accept or reject each offer. In our prior work most youths, even those with LPE, declined at least some offers, helping the charity at a cost to themselves, a behavior we term "costly helping". But why would youth engage in costly helping and not just maximize self-benefit? We told all participants that how they played the game would be held in strict confidence. Therefore concerns about reputation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref045">45</xref>] were unlikely to drive this behavior. Likewise, participants knew this charity, the Red Cross, would never be informed how large a donation each player left while playing the game, reducing concerns that hopes for reciprocal altruism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref046">46</xref>] drove choices in the game. When individuals must consider reward to self and cost to another simultaneously, they appear to sublimate drive for self and consider the characteristics of the other and “good actors” are helped (costly helping), at a cost to oneself. But people differ in the extent of costly helping they exhibit. Our prior work suggests that LPE is associated with lower levels of costly helping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref036">36</xref>]. Here we seek to confirm the negative association between LPE and this prosocial behavior, costly helping.</p>
<p>In this study we sought to (1) replicate our prior work showing that LPE (i.e. high callous unemotional traits) reduces costly helping, (2) extend that prior work by testing the prediction that costly helping will not be reduced in individuals with serious conduct problems but without LPE, (3) test whether groups (controls, conduct problems, conduct problems with LPE) differ in Moral Elevation and (4) test whether differences in Moral Elevation mediate the link between callous unemotional traits and costly helping. Given that this study is the first (to our knowledge) to examine Moral Elevation and costly helping in youth with conduct problems and LPE, we sought to avoid a potential confound of sex differences in our design by limiting it to males only. For example, conduct disorder has a male:female ratio of about 2–4:1, but early-onset conduct disorder that persists into adulthood has a ratio of 10–15:1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref050">50</xref>]. Similarly sex differences in self-reported empathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref051">51</xref>], prosocial reasoning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref052">52</xref>] and level of callous unemotional traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref053">53</xref>] have been demonstrated. As males predominately commit violent criminal behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref054">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref055">55</xref>], our sample was limited to them.</p>

<title>Meeting 2</title>
<p>Approximately 7 days after the first assessment, adolescent participants were transported via taxi to the Brain Imaging Center of the University of Colorado Denver on the Anschutz Medical Campus. They then submitted a urine test for drugs and a saliva test for alcohol, and a trained research assistant administered a structured interview about any recent caffeine or nicotine consumption, alcohol and drug use, and current nicotine or caffeine withdrawal symptoms. In a quiet, private research-dedicated testing room participants viewed a 90-second investigator-produced Power Point slide presentation with pre-recorded messages and pictures showing good things the Red Cross does. Participants then indicated how much good they feel the Red Cross does by marking on a 100mm line anchored by the terms “No good at all” and “Lots of good” (Red Cross Visual Analogue Scale). Participants were then trained to play the AlAn’s game. Another automated Power Point presentation with pre-recorded audio explained the game’s instructions; participants then answered 2 questions about specific trials of the game to ensure comprehension of instructions, and played a short practice version of the game (with dollar amounts not found in the real game) on a laptop to acclimatize to the game timing and format. Participants were reminded that research data would be held in strict confidence by the researchers and that parents/treatment program staff would not be told the choices they made while playing the game. Participants were given the opportunity to ask questions and to replay the practice game as needed. Participants then were taken to our mock scanner where they could acclimatize to the MRI environment. They played the short practice version of the game while lying in the mock scanner and listened to recorded MRI machine sounds through earphones. Then participants played the AlAn’s game while in the MRI scanner (manuscripts detailing the MRI findings are in preparation). Participants were reimbursed $80 at the end of the MRI session and could earn (and keep) up to approximately 16 additional dollars while playing the AlAn’s game if they chose to accept all trials where they could benefit even if the Red Cross donation would be reduced. Parents were also reimbursed $10 for completing questionnaires about their child.</p>

<title>Description of the AlAn’s Game</title>
<p>The AlAn’s (<bold>Al</bold>triusm/<bold>An</bold>tisocial) game requires participants to make decisions to accept or reject real-money offers in which they will benefit, but at a cost to another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref036">36</xref>]. A planned, real donation to the Red Cross starts at $16 but can decline due to choices made by the participant playing the game; participants start with no money. We told participants that we would give the Red Cross the value of the charity donation remaining at the end of playing the game (we donated $612.36 to the Red Cross at the end of the study). There are 144 choices (“trials”) in the AlAn’s game. During each trial participants 1) view and consider the offer, 2) press an “accept” key or a “reject” key, 3) observe the outcome of the choice. Analogue “thermometers” and digital counters show how much money the participant has accrued and the current remaining value of the charity donation. There are 3 trial types in the AlAn’s game (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151678.g001">Fig 1</xref>): <underline><bold>Active Trials</bold></underline> present the amount that the participant will gain (range in different trials 2–64 cents) and amount the Red Cross will lose (same range but usually different amount). Participants accept or reject each choice; after rejected choices neither counter changes. <underline><bold>Attentional Control Trials</bold></underline> have a predictable response. Participants should be motivated to reject all trials in which both they and the Red Cross will lose money (hereafter referred to as Logically-Reject Trials) and conversely, should be motivated to accept all choices in which they will get money but the Red Cross donation will not be reduced (hereafter referred to as Logically-Accept Trials). <underline><bold>Calculation Trials</bold></underline> assess whether patients and controls can understand the relative numerical values in the time allotted. They present one positive number for the participant and another for the Red Cross and the participant is asked to determine, “Is the YOU number bigger?” Participants press the YES button to indicate that the participant’s number is bigger than the Red Cross’ number. Calculation Trials use the same matrix of numbers used in the Active Trials. As an incentive, if subjects correctly answered at least 75% of the 60 Calculation Trials, they received an additional 25 cents.</p>

<title>Two Patient Groups</title>
<p>By design, we sought to recruit adolescent patients with serious conduct problems and divide them into two groups: those meeting the LPE specifier and those not meeting this specifier. Therefore, patients recruited for the study were divided into those meeting and not meeting this specifier by utilizing questions 3, 5, 6, and 8 from the ICU, following our prior procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref036">36</xref>]. Based on our prior work, we expected that while using these procedures about half of the patient sample would meet the LPE and that these two groups would be very similar for substance use disorder severity. It is important to note that we utilize the LPE categorization method from the ICU described in the supporting document of the DSM-5 revision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref065">65</xref>], and this is the same procedure we used in our prior work on the AlAn’s game [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref036">36</xref>], but others in the research literature have used other symptoms sets or other thresholds for item endorsement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref066">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref067">67</xref>].</p>

<title>Main Outcome Measures</title>
<p>For the AlAn’s game, we had 3 <italic>a priori</italic> outcome measures of interest: (1) the amount of money taken for self while playing the game, (2) the amount of money remaining in the Red Cross donation after playing the game and (3) the number of times participants did not take the Active Trials. The game automatically produces the number of accepted Active + Attention Control Trials. Therefore, this third variable was calculated by the following formula (= 72-(number of total trials accepted—the number of accepted Attention Control Trials). This final outcome served as our measure of “costly helping.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec014">
<title>Analytic Plan</title>
<p>We compared patients with LPE, patients without LPE and controls for demographics (age, race, ethnicity, SES), estimated IQ, clinical and diagnostic measures (substance use disorders, conduct disorder severity, peak aggression) and callous unemotional traits severity, utilizing chi square and Fisher Exact Tests for categorical and ANOVA or Kruskal Wallis tests for dimensional variables. Next we compared groups with ANOVA or Kruskal Wallis on our 3 AlAn’s game outcome measures, and the Red Cross VAS (i.e. “How much good does the Red Cross do?”); if the group effect was significant, we evaluated all 2-way group comparisons (e.g., using Tukey’s post hoc tests). We also calculated the percent of Logically-Accept Trials accepted, percent of Logically-Reject Trials rejected, and the percent of Calculation Trials correctly answered. We then completed Spearman rank order correlations between our 3 AlAn’s game outcomes, ICU total score, conduct disorder symptom count and parent-reported CBCL and adolescent-reported YSR conduct problems scale raw scores and the attention-deficit hyperactivity problems raw scores 1) across all groups (n = 71), 2) across patient groups (n = 45) and 3) within controls (n = 26). Finally, we calculated the percent of Active Trials accepted by trial type for each groups.</p>
<p>To address our hypotheses that Moral Elevation would differ between the groups, we first calculated pre-stimulus (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., prior to viewing the video), and separately post-stimulus, scores for the four Moral Elevation domains: desire to be a better person, view of humanity, elevating emotions, and physical symptoms (each with a range of 0–4, questions available upon request from the corresponding author) and summed them to create a total Moral Elevation score (range 0–16) following the general procedures outlined by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref035">35</xref>]. We tested for group differences in pre-stimulus total Moral Elevation using ANOVA (and post hoc Tukey comparisons, when group effect was significant). This procedure allowed us to evaluate whether groups differed significantly in Moral Elevation scores at baseline. Our design was such that had groups differed in Moral Elevation scores at baseline, we planned to use change from pre-stimulus to post-stimulus to estimate Moral Elevation response to the stimulus, adjusting for baseline differences. Because groups did not differ in Moral Elevation scores at baseline, we used post-stimulus Moral Elevation scores as our outcome and tested whether groups differed with ANOVA and post-hoc 2-group comparisons. Next, we tested within group, whether Moral Elevation scores significantly increased from pre-stimulus to post-stimulus, using paired t-tests. Finally, we conducted exploratory mediational analyses. We utilized the Preacher &amp; Hayes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref068">68</xref>] approach to mediational analyses using the Indirect Macro (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.afhayes.com/index.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.afhayes.com/index.html</ext-link>) with total ICU score as the independent variable, costly helping on the AlAn’s game as the dependent variable and post-stimulus total Moral Elevation as the mediator, covarying group (patient vs. control), completing 5,000 bootstrap iterations and calculating the 95% confidence interval.</p>

<title>Sample Description</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0151678.t001">Table 1</xref> presents demographics, IQ measures and diagnostic or clinical measures for patients with LPE (n = 23), patients without LPE (n = 22) and controls (n = 26). Patients without LPE were slightly older (17.2 years) than patients with LPE and controls (both 16.5 years). Groups did not differ significantly in terms of race (p = 0.15), ethnicity (p = 0.18) or parent socioeconomic status (p = 0.10). Groups differed significantly in IQ (p = 0.047) with controls (mean estimated IQ 106.5) having the highest scores (patients with LPE 100.3 and patients without LPE 100.9) but all three post-hoc two-group comparisons were non-significant. As expected from our sampling strategy, no controls met criteria for conduct disorder or any substance use disorder but the two patient groups had similar rates of self-reported conduct and substance use disorder diagnoses. Thus, as expected from prior work (Sakai et al., in review), the two patient groups were quite similar overall for co-morbidity at the diagnostic level. However, patients with LPE averaged 6.6 lifetime conduct disorder symptoms, while patients without LPE averaged 5.0 and controls 0.3 (p&lt;0.001). Patients with LPE also had the highest peak aggression scores (6.3; p&lt;0.001) and ICU total scores (p&lt;0.001), followed by patients without LPE and controls.</p>

<title>Testing for Group Differences in AlAn’s Game Outcome Measures</title>
<p>Patients with LPE, patients without LPE and controls differed significantly in the amount of money taken for self while playing the game ($13.91, $12.26, $11.64, respectively; Kruskal Wallis test p = 0.02), the amount of money left in the Red Cross donation at the end of the game ($6.81, $8.49, $10.34, respectively; F = 3.66, p = 0.03) and number of Active Trials not taken, our measure of costly helping (19.5, 28.5, 32.4, respectively; F = 3.20, p = 0.047). Because all 3-group analyses were significant, post-hoc 2-group comparisons were completed and showed that controls vs. patients with LPE differed significantly for all 3 AlAn’s outcome measures; other 2-group comparisons were non-significant at the post-hoc corrected threshold.

<title>AlAn’s Game Performance Measures</title>
<p>Patients with LPE, patients without LPE and controls had similar results on the Red Cross VAS “How much good does the Red Cross do?” (86.5, 91.8, 87.6, respectively, where 0 = “No good at all” and 100 = “Lots of good”; p = 0.20), suggesting that on average they viewed the Red Cross quite positively. Patients with LPE, patients without LPE and controls also accepted a high percentage of Logically-Accept Trials (95.7%, 93.9% and 97.4%, respectively; p = 0.64), rejected a high rate of Logically-Reject Trials (92.8%, 93.9% and 95.5%, respectively; p = 0.27), and correctly answered a high percentage of the 60 Calculation Trials (95%, 89.5%, 94.7% and respectively; p = 0.96).</p>

Path “c” shows a significant relationship between total score on the Inventory of Callous Unemotional traits and costly helping. Path “a” shows a significant relationship between callous unemotional traits and Moral Elevation and path “b” shows that Moral Elevation has a unique effect on costly helping.

After bootstrapping (5000 iterations), the 95% confidence interval testing for mediation effects of Moral Elevation excludes zero (95% CI -0.53 to -0.06), supporting a significant mediational effect (Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008).

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="sec022">
<title>Replicating and Extending Prior Work on the Link between AlAn’s Game and Callous Unemotional Traits</title>
<p>We replicated our prior work showing that a game of costly helping significantly discriminates patients with LPE from controls. Our findings are remarkably similar to our preliminary work (see two panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151678.g002">Fig 2</xref>), suggesting a robust association while utilizing the same procedures. Examination of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0151678.s001">S1 Fig</xref> supports that the game operated as expected. Moving from left to right, we see that, while holding gain-to-self constant and increasing loss to the Red Cross, acceptance rates generally decline. Similarly, as we move from the top of each column to the bottom, we see that as the loss to the Red Cross is held constant and gain-to-self increases, the acceptance rates generally increase. Thus although the amount of money in individual trials is small (range 2–64 cents), participants’ behavior supports the idea that the amounts were motivating. In addition, similar performance between groups on Calculations trials supports the idea that groups could assess the relative values presented in the Active Trials in the time allotted. The high acceptance rates of Logically-Accept Trials and the high rates of rejection of the Logically-Reject Trials support that all groups behaved logically when unambiguous trials were presented. It also supports that subjects generally assessed trial content, instead of simply falling into a pattern of always accepting, or rejecting trials.</p>
<p>Just as in our preliminary work, we controlled for several confounds that might have influenced our results. Participants were monitored for substance use and were 30 days substance free per self-report and at least 1-week substance free by urine/saliva monitoring. Thus, recent substance use did not drive decision-making during the game. The game is also designed to provide concrete offers, rather than assessment of probabilities. Therefore, risk-assessment or risk-taking are eliminated from the game, which is important given patients with conduct disorder/substance use disorder have increased risk-taking propensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref069">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref070">70</xref>]. Because patients also tend to act impulsively, the game requires that participants wait 5 seconds prior to making a choice. This delay was instituted to reduce impulsive decision making; such delays have been shown to normalize response reversal learning in adults with ASPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref071">71</xref>]. In addition, our correlational analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0151678.s003">S2 Table</xref>) show that ADHD scores (parent- and child-reported) were not significantly related to AlAn’s game outcomes, suggesting that inattention and impulsivity did not drive behavior in the game.</p>
<p>This study also extends our prior work in one notable and important way. In our prior work we had relatively few patients without LPE and therefore did not include results on that group in our published work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref036">36</xref>] but here we collected data on 22 patients without LPE. We predicted that patients without LPE would behave similarly to controls on the AlAn’s game, but instead demonstrate that the behavior of patients without LPE is intermediate between patients with LPE and controls on our three AlAn’s game outcomes of interest. This pattern was true even though patients without LPE had dimensional scores for callous unemotional traits similar to controls (see bottom row of <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0151678.t001">Table 1</xref>). This finding suggests that although behavior on the AlAn’s game is associated with levels of callous unemotional traits, conduct disorder itself may convey some additional effect that reduces the propensity to engage in costly helping. For example, conduct disorder <italic>severity</italic> is associated with behavior on the game (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0151678.s003">S2 Table</xref>). Future work is needed to explore this possibility.</p>
<p>Clinical implications: The AlAn’s game provides a standardized behavioral measure reflecting “limited prosocial emotions”. This simple game may be useful in multiple research settings where confidentiality is assured, including studies that attempt to search for biological markers of callous-unemotional traits, such as MRI studies. Unfortunately, we do not anticipate that AlAn’s game would be useful in clinical settings where patients had incentive to dissemble (e.g., court-ordered evaluations). We suspect that with incentive, players could easily alter behavior on the game.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec023">
<title>Explaining the Link Between Callous Unemotional Traits and AlAn’s Game Behavior</title>
<p>One important question is, “Why do groups differ in their behavior on the AlAn’s game?” One possibility is that groups differ in their moral judgments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref072">72</xref>]. Unfortunately, we did not measure moral judgments or reasoning here but do show that all three groups viewed the Red Cross equally favorably, consistent with our past work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref036">36</xref>]. Future studies might measure whether participants think the Red Cross “ought” to be helped and explicitly measure moral judgments and reasoning to test for associations with costly helping. Although there are very important exceptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref072">72</xref>], prior work supports that adults with psychopathy may make similar moral judgments to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref073">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref074">74</xref>] while still differing in their behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref075">75</xref>]. If true, one logical question emerges: why would individuals with psychopathy, despite having similar moral judgments or beliefs, exhibit behaviors that do not align with those beliefs? In an attempt to answer this question, we turned to the influential model proposed by Blair et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref026">26</xref>] which suggests that individuals with LPE lack an ability to interpret emotional cues, which are important to restraining aggressive and antisocial behavior. Here we sought to extend that model to help explain the linkage between callous unemotional traits and costly helping as being mediated by Moral Elevation.</p>
<p>We present several novel findings regarding Moral Elevation. For example, we demonstrate that a Moral Elevation response is a fairly universal phenomenon. Patients in treatment for serious antisocial behavior and substance problems who also have high levels of callous-unemotional traits (and meet the LPE specifier) do exhibit a significant Moral Elevation response (pre-stimulus to post-stimulus increase in Moral Elevation scores). But there are group differences in the magnitude of that response. Controls show the strongest Moral Elevation, patients without LPE show the next highest and patients with LPE show the weakest Moral Elevation response. Next, using the Preacher &amp; Hayes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref068">68</xref>] method, we demonstrated that Moral Elevation mediates the link between callous-unemotional traits and costly helping in this sample. Taken together these results support that patients with LPE may experience a blunted response to emotional cues, which means they are lacking an immediate motivator toward prosocial behavior. Individuals with a blunted Moral Elevation response may require greater vigilance and top-down cognitive control to ensure their actions match their moral beliefs. Although from Blair’s model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref026">26</xref>] we might expect that patients without LPE would function similarly to controls or inhibit prosocial behaviors mainly in the setting of exaggerated self-focused emotionality (e.g., anxiety and personal distress), patients without LPE fell between controls and patients with LPE in their Moral Elevation response and costly helping behaviors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec024">
<title>Implications for Conservation of Human Altruism</title>
<p>Finally, although our main focus has been on patients with LPE, our results may have a broader set of implications. Most participants while playing AlAn’s game made at least some choices to not take offers where they would have received money but at a cost to the charity donation. Why not just maximize gains for self? Here, we propose that when an actor is seen as beneficent, as a “good” actor, individuals engage in costly helping, where they give up a benefit to self to aid a beneficent other. Our data suggest most youths, even many patients with LPE, engage in some level of costly helping, which is a subset of altruistic behaviors. All costly helping is altruism but not all altruistic acts are costly helping. For example, altruistic acts may be directed randomly or based on need of the recipient, not based on whether the recipient is a “good” actor. Instead costly helping, by the definition proposed here, is directed at a good actor. Costly helping then is directed at altruists and based on our initial studies, most individuals engage in at least some costly helping. If it could be shown that costly helping, similar to costly punishment, is a human attribute common across human societies, this could have implications for the promotion of cooperation within social groups and the evolutionary conservation of human altruism.</p>

<sec id="sec025">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Our work has several important limitations. First, we selected a male-only sample. Thus, whether our results can be extrapolated to females is an open question. However, the traits of interest (e.g., conduct problems, callous-unemotional traits) are more prevalent in males, prompting our male focus in this initial study. Second, we focus on adolescents. It is unclear whether the AlAn’s game would function similarly to assess costly helping among younger children or adults. Third, our mediational analyses should be viewed as preliminary. Ideally others might utilize general population sampling strategies rather than our selected patient-control group approach. In addition, the term mediation implies a causal relationship, where variables may be measured across time in the order proposed by the hypothesized model. Our study was not longitudinal, though we measured Moral Elevation about 1 week before playing the AlAn’s game and our independent variable, callous unemotional traits, is generally considered a stable trait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref076">76</xref>]. Ideally the independent variable also might be manipulated (e.g., treatment vs. no treatment) allowing control of unmeasured confounders through randomization. Thus, we cannot be certain about a causal relationship in our mediational analyses. Still, despite these limitations, we hope that our work will motivate others to explore this interesting observation. Fourth, as noted above, we did not measure moral beliefs and judgments, making it impossible to rule out that differences in moral decision making explained behavioral differences in patients with LPE. Fifth, there are certainly other domains of interest which may mediate the link between callous unemotional trait and costly helping. For example, reward dominance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151678.ref077">77</xref>] has been previously linked with antisocial behavior problems and could be tested in social (e.g., reputation) and non-social contexts. We did not measure these constructs here. Future research might explore such links. Sixth, we did not debrief subjects after they played the game to allow them to explain their behaviors. Therefore, we cannot comment on the participants’ reasoning behind various behavioral patterns. Seventh, our sample is relatively modest in size and our results therefore should be replicated in larger samples.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We recruited three groups of male adolescents: patients with serious conduct and substance problems and LPE, patients with serious antisocial behavior problems but without LPE, and controls. We replicated our prior finding that the AlAn’s game significantly discriminates patients with LPE and controls in their behavior, showed that self-reported post-stimulus Moral Elevation strongly discriminates groups and in our exploratory analyses demonstrated that Moral Elevation mediated the link between callous-unemotional traits and costly helping behaviors in this sample. However, our sample size is relatively modest in size and our results require independent replication. Therefore, we now make the AlAn’s game E-Prime<sup>®</sup> (Psychology Software Tools, Sharpsburg, PA) program available to other laboratories with the hopes that new groups may attempt to replicate this association between callous unemotional traits and costly helping among adolescents (game may be obtained by contacting authors Sakai or Dalwani).</p>
