      <abstract>
        <p>High-dimensional datasets with large amounts of redundant information are nowadays available for <italic>hypothesis-free</italic> exploration of scientific questions. A particular case is genome-wide association analysis, where variations in the genome are searched for effects on disease or other traits. Bayesian variable selection has been demonstrated as a possible analysis approach, which can account for the multifactorial nature of the genetic effects in a linear regression model.</p>
        <p>Yet, the computation presents a challenge and application to large-scale data is not routine. Here, we study aspects of the computation using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for the variable selection: finite adaptation of the proposal distributions, multistep moves for changing the inclusion state of multiple variables in a single proposal and multistep move size adaptation. We also experiment with a delayed rejection step for the multistep moves. Results on simulated and real data show increase in the sampling efficiency. We also demonstrate that with application specific proposals, the approach can overcome a specific mixing problem in real data with 3822 individuals and 1,051,811 single nucleotide polymorphisms and uncover a variant pair with synergistic effect on the studied trait. Moreover, we illustrate multimodality in the real dataset related to a restrictive prior distribution on the genetic effect sizes and advocate a more flexible alternative.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The progress in high-throughput measurement technologies has allowed application specialists to gather extensive datasets with often large amounts of redundant information for the addressed scientific question. This is particularly true in (human) genetics, where it has become cost-effective to measure individual genetic variation at the scale of millions of polymorphic sites in the DNA. Numerous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been published during the last decade linking the genetic variation to disease and other traits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Hindorff1">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>However, such data analysis is not without problems. The primary association analyses in GWAS are mainly conducted by testing each polymorphic site, usually single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), for association independently and then correcting for multiple hypothesis testing. This simplification is computationally convenient, but does not acknowledge the hypothesis of multifactorial genetic background for many common diseases and traits. Alternatives, which consider all of the genetic variants simultaneously, include penalized multivariate regression and variable selection methods (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Hoggart1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Guan1">[3]</xref>).</p>
      <p>In this work, we focus on the computation of the Bayesian linear regression model with variable selection using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The variable selection is a natural fit for the main task in GWAS of searching for the genetic variants showing association to a phenotype of interest, and such models have been recently applied successfully to various sizes of genetic datasets including full GWAS scale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Guan1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Peltola1">[4]</xref>. These models introduce latent binary indicator variables <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to specify the inclusion status of each genetic variant (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) in the regression model. The expected sparsity is encoded into the prior distribution of the indicators. The relevant posterior quantities are then obtained through model averaging (where model refers to a configuration of the indicator vector <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). However, the computation can be challenging as the Markov chains may suffer from long autocorrelation.</p>
      <p>A general approach to the variable selection in this framework is the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (MH) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Metropolis1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Hastings1">[6]</xref>, where to generate samples from the posterior distribution, changes to the state of the indicator vector <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are proposed from a proposal distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and then accepted as the new state or rejected (duplicating the previous state in the MCMC chain) according to the MH acceptance probability:<disp-formula id="pone.0049445.e007"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e007" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the current and the proposed state and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the posterior probability.</p>
      <p>Here, we study the following ideas in formulating the proposal distribution <italic>q</italic>: 1) finite adaptation of the proposal distributions for adding and removing variables from the model, 2) adding and removing multiple variables in a single proposal (multistep move) with finite adaptation of the move size (the number of additions/removals proposed) and 3) delayed rejection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Mira1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Green1">[8]</xref>, which re-utilizes some of the computations leading to a rejected proposal in making a second proposal from a larger set of states. The resulting sampling algorithms are studied on simulated data and a real GWAS dataset with nearly four thousand individuals and over one million SNPs (analyzed previously in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Peltola1">[4]</xref>) with a focus on the efficiency of the sampling. We further describe additional proposals tailored to the genetic data, which help against specific convergence and mixing problems encountered in the real data, and demonstrate in the real data that a prior, which is flexible to having few large effect sizes among many small, may be desirable.</p>
      <p>The motivation for adapting the proposal distributions stems from the <italic>small n, large p</italic> property of the data with most of the <italic>p</italic> variables being irrelevant. Proposing updates to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> uniformly from the large set of variables may waste lots of computation time on rejecting poor proposals and be slow to find high posterior probability models. Here, the marginal inclusion probabilities of the variables will be used to form the proposal distributions, which are adapted during an initial phase in the sampling before collecting samples for posterior inference (finite adaptation). This is similar to the (full) adaptive sampler of Nott and Kohn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Nott1">[9]</xref>. The Bayesian adaptive sampling algorithm (BAS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Clyde1">[10]</xref> also uses the marginal inclusion probabilities for sampling. It differs from the above mentioned in that it samples models without replacement (and is not an MCMC method). Our previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Peltola1">[4]</xref> included finite adaptation of the proposal distribution for (single) additions, while Guan and Stephens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Guan1">[3]</xref> have used statistics from single variable analyses to form the proposal distribution for additions. The latter two articles do not study the efficiency of the samplers.</p>
      <p>Multistep moves have been used in GWAS setting by Guan and Stephens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Guan1">[3]</xref>, but they provide little details beyond the mention of generating them as combinations of single additions and removals. As the multistep proposals for updating <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> do not come from a uniform distribution, some care is required in formulating <italic>q</italic> in a proper way. Here, the sequential Metropolis-Hastings proposal framework of Storvik <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Storvik1">[11]</xref> will be utilized to provide theoretical validity of the resulting Markov chain. Lamnisos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Lamnisos1">[12]</xref> discuss the adaptation of the move size in multistep moves with uniform proposal distribution for variable inclusion updates. They use acceptance rate coercion to adapt the move size proposal distribution, which relies on the knowledge or estimate of optimal acceptance rate. An alternative approach is provided by Pasarica and Gelman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Pasarica1">[13]</xref>, who maximize the expected jump distance of the Markov chain (corresponding to minimizing the first autocorrelation), and is here introduced in the variable selection context. This has the advantage of not relying on the availability of the knowledge of the optimal acceptance rate.</p>
      <p>We also experiment with a novel delayed rejection step, which re-utilizes some of the computations leading to a rejected multistep proposal. In the delayed rejection algorithm if the first proposal is rejected, another proposal may be made. Here, assuming a <italic>k</italic>-step proposal, which is rejected, the full set of posterior probabilities of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> models available from changes to the inclusion status of the <italic>k</italic> variables can be computed using relatively cheap updates to the likelihood of the full model (particularly, the Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix), which is available fully or in part from the rejected proposal. A second proposal is then made from this set of models utilizing the computed posterior probabilities.</p>
      <p>An open source C++ implementation of the samplers presented here is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://becs.aalto.fi/en/research/bayes/bmagwa/" xlink:type="simple">http://becs.aalto.fi/en/research/bayes/bmagwa/</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/to-mi/" xlink:type="simple">https://github.com/to-mi/</ext-link>. It has been specifically developed for GWA analysis allowing for fast and memory-efficient handling of large datasets.</p>

        <p>The model mapping from genotypes (values of the explanatory variables) to a phenotype (the target variable) is briefly introduced here. This is essentially the same as in our previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Peltola1">[4]</xref>, except here we consider only additive formulation for the genetic effects and introduce a more flexible prior for the variance of the effect sizes.

        <p>The parameters of the proposal distribution may be adapted during an initial phase in the sampling (giving a total of six different samplers; three adaptive and three non-adaptive). The parameters are then fixed before collecting posterior samples (finite adaptation). Non-adaptive algorithms employ uniform distribution to generate the proposals (expect that move size adaptation is allowed here for all multistep samplers to avoid trial-and-error in finding a good proposal distribution). Brief descriptions of the sampling and adaptation are given below. Details are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0049445.s012">Text S1</xref>.</p>

          <title>Sequential proposal for variable inclusion updates</title>
          <p>Given the move size, additions and removals are proposed in a sequence with probability 0.5 (unless there are no variables to add or remove). Denoting the sequence of proposed changes using auxiliary variables <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the proposal distribution can be written as a product <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is taken as the empty sequence. The individual proposal distributions <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for selecting the variables to add or remove are formed according to the estimates of the marginal inclusion probabilities <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the variables, which are continuously updated during the adaptive phase of sampling using the Rao-Blackwellization method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Guan1">[3]</xref>. The proposals for variables to add are generated by sampling variables proportional to the estimated inclusion probabilities (with bounding away from zero using a preset minimum value) unless the variable has already been proposed to be added in this round. Variables to remove are sampled identically except for the sampling probabilities being proportional to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
          <p>Alternatively, the usual MCMC estimates of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> could be used in the adaptation with a smaller computational cost than the Rao-Blackwellization, but the latter provides more robust estimates especially at the beginning of the sampling and when the number of variables is large.</p>
          <p>The above sampling scheme is here cast into the form of Storvik <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Storvik1">[11]</xref> (with some differences in notation) to write the acceptance probability and show the validity of the scheme. The full proposal distribution is written as<disp-formula id="pone.0049445.e130"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e130" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula></p>
          <p>In this, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the model derived from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with the operations specified by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e134" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and zero otherwise. In order to be able to calculate the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probability, the sequence of auxiliary variables related to the reverse proposal must be specified. To this end, a distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e135" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is introduced. The distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e136" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> places unit probability to a single sequence of auxiliary variables which is obtained from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e137" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e138" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> using a specific deterministic procedure (see below). Given these distributions, the acceptance probability for the proposal is<disp-formula id="pone.0049445.e139"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e139" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(7)</label></disp-formula>which, according to Proposition 2 of Storvik <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Storvik1">[11]</xref>, leads to samples from the correct target distribution with proper convergence and ergodicity results when the Markov chain is irreducible. For some insight, the move may be viewed as an iteration of an MCMC for sampling from the joint distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e140" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which has the correct marginal for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e141" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The iteration consists of a Gibbs step updating <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e142" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e143" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, followed by a Metropolis-Hastings step with the specified acceptance probability during which <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e144" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is proposed to be replaced by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e145" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

          <p>Regarding <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, a simple approach would be to take <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e149" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the reverse of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (i.e., additions become removals with the sampling order reversed and vice versa) and zero otherwise. However, to be consistent with the delayed rejection implementation, a slightly more complex deterministic procedure is chosen here (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0049445.s012">Text S1</xref>).</p>
          <p>An alternative to introducing the sampling order to the acceptance probability would be to sum over the different orderings of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e152" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

          <title>Example 1</title>
          <p>Here we illustrate the notation and behavior of the sampling algorithm using a concrete, albeit overly simplistic, example. Suppose the total number of SNPs in data is equal to 5 and let the current state of the algorithm be <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e153" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, i.e., the second SNP is currently included in the model. Note that here, for shortcut, we represent <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e154" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, actually a vector of indicators, as a set of non-zero indicators. The sampling then proceeds as follows. 1) The number of updates, <italic>k</italic>, is drawn. Suppose that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e155" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is selected. 2) The type of update (addition/removal) and the SNP involved is determined in turn for each update. Suppose this results in the sequence of auxiliary variables <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e156" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, meaning that SNPs 3 and 4 are proposed to be added to the model. This, in turn, fixes the proposed new state to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e157" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Furthermore, this fixes the sequence of auxiliary variables in the reverse proposal to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e158" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Recall that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e159" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is determined using the distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e160" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which places a unit mass on a single sequence of auxiliary variables using the deterministic procedure, as described earlier. Also note that applying <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e161" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e162" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> would change the state back to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e163" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> again, as required. 3) Finally, the acceptance probability specified in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0049445.e139">Equation 7</xref> is used to decide whether to change the current state from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e164" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e165" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

          <p>Delayed rejection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Mira1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Green1">[8]</xref> builds on the result of Peskun <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Peskun1">[17]</xref>, which states that given two transition probability matrices of Markov chains, the one with greater off-diagonal elements has lower asymptotic variance for the MCMC estimate of an expectation of a function. Whereas the MH sampling algorithm replicates the old state on rejection and proceeds to the next iteration, the delayed rejection algorithm makes a second proposal (and possibly more), which is then considered for acceptance. The acceptance probability is constructed to preserve the reversibility of the Markov chain. The algorithm can only increase the off-diagonal mass in the transition matrix as the acceptance probability of the first proposal is not affected.</p>
          <p>An essential feature of delayed rejection is that the second proposal may depend on the first. Here, this is taken advantage of by re-utilizing the computations performed for the first proposal. Note that the time complexity of computing the likelihood after the first proposal has been made is dominated by the updates to the Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix of the predictors (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e166" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and computation of the covariances when variables are added (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e167" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with <italic>q</italic> the number of variables in the model and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e168" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the number of new variables). Now, following a proposal from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e169" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e170" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> through auxiliary variable <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e171" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> which is to be rejected, another proposal is made instead. The second proposal is sampled from the set of models, which can be constructed by flipping elements of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e172" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with the flips restricted to the variables indicated by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e173" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. There are <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e174" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> such models, where <italic>k</italic> is the move size of the first proposal.

This overhead is often small compared to making a completely new proposal, when <italic>q</italic> or <italic>n</italic> are large relative to <italic>k</italic> and allows the sampling to use the knowledge of the posterior probabilities of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e176" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> models.</p>

          <title>Example 2</title>
          <p>Here we illustrate the delayed rejection part of the sampling algorithm by continuing from Example 1 and assuming that the suggested move from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e184" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e185" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was rejected. Recall also that the sequence of auxiliary variables related to the first proposal was <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e186" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Thus, in the first proposal, SNPs 3 and 4 were proposed to be added to the model. The big picture here is that starting from the rejected first proposal we make a second proposal. To calculate the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probability of this <italic>two-step forward proposal</italic>, a corresponding <italic>two-step backward proposal</italic> must be specified. In our approach, the backward route is fixed deterministically such that the second step of the forward proposal is always accepted.</p>
          <p>The delayed rejection part of the algorithm proceeds by sampling the second (forward) proposal from the set of all models which can be reached from the initial state <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e187" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by applying any subset of operations in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e188" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Here, we will denote this set of models by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e189" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Consequently, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e190" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e191" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The models are sampled from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e192" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> using a distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e193" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> which is selected such that it cancels the terms <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e194" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e195" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e196" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the numerator of the acceptance probability given in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0049445.e177">Equation 8</xref>. Suppose the model proposed is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e197" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Note that no auxiliary variables are related to this second proposal, as the model itself is sampled directly.</p>
          <p>Now, the two-step backward proposal is determined as follows: first, auxiliary variables related to the <italic>first step in the backward proposal</italic> are deterministically set to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e198" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> corresponding to proposing the model <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e199" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This follows, because it is required that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e200" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, i.e. that the second proposals in both forward and backward moves are sampled from the same set of models. To calculate the acceptance probability of this first step in the backward proposal, the reversed sequence <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e201" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of auxiliary variables is required similarly to the first step in the forward proposal (see Example 1), yielding <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e202" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
          <p>After rejection of the first step in the backward proposal, the second step must change the state back to the original model <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e203" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. With these specifications at hand, the acceptance probability of the second step in the forward proposal can be evaluated using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0049445.e177">Equation 8</xref>, and is found to be equal to unity. In summary, the only variables that were sampled during the whole MCMC step are: 1) the sequence of auxiliary variables sampled in the first step of the forward proposal, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e204" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and 2) the model sampled in the second step of the forward proposal, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e205" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. All other variables required when calculating the acceptance probability follow deterministically from these two along with the initial state <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e206" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

          <title>Additional moves for SNP data</title>
          <p>Two additional moves are introduced specifically for genetic data, where the variables can be ordered linearly (corresponding to their locations in the genome) and neighboring variables may have block-like correlation structure (linkage disequilibrium), which may complicate the mixing of the Markov chain.</p>
          <p>The first move type proceeds by selecting one variable in the model (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e207" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) randomly to be swapped with a variable which is located in its neighborhood (defined by a cutoff in the distance of the linear indices) and is not in the model (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e208" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). A similar move is also considered by Guan and Stephens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Guan1">[3]</xref>. The second move type begins identically by randomly selecting one variable in the model (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e209" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Then, an update to a randomly selected neighboring variable (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e210" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) is proposed. For both of these move types, multiple updates of the same type may be incorporated into a single proposal. Further, delayed rejection is allowed for the latter move type (i.e., we allow reverting some of the proposed updates in a multistep proposal similarly to the delayed rejection described above, but with simpler acceptance probability as the updates are proposed from a uniform distribution).</p>

        <p>A dataset of 3895 individuals with quality controlled, measured or imputed genotypes at 1,051,811 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is used to test the sampling algorithms. High- (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, for 3822 individuals) phenotype data were available for analysis. Moreover, 20 simulated datasets were generated for four simulation configurations using the genotypes of the first chromosome (85,331 SNPs) for 2002 of the individuals and a linear model for the phenotype. The simulated data had either 30 or 100 SNPs randomly selected as causal with additive genetic effects, whose sizes were generated from a double exponential distribution. Normally distributed noise was added to the phenotypes to set the proportion of variance explained (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e217" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) by the causal SNPs to 0.2 or 0.5.

        <p>The efficiencies of the samplers were tested on the simulated datasets. The samplers are abbreviated as SS for single-step sampler, MS for multistep sampler, MS-DR for multistep sampler with delayed rejection, NK for Nott-Kohn and KSC for Kohn-Smith-Chan. Maximum move size in the multistep samplers is 20 and delayed rejection is restricted to moves with size of 10 or less. The (finite) adaptivity of SS, MS and MS-DR samplers refers to the tuning of the proposal probabilities of which variables to add or remove. Non-adaptive samplers employ discrete uniform distribution for this. All MS and MS-DR samplers use move size proposal adaptation. NK and KSC samplers were run with block sizes 1, 5 and 10. Three independent MCMC chains were run for 20,000,000 (KSC and NK) or 2,000,000 (others) iterations of the third step in the Computation and thinned by taking every 100th (KSC and NK) or every 10th (others) sample. The KSC and NK algorithms were run for ten times longer as they have cheaper iterations and showed convergence problems with shorter runs. First halves of all chains are discarded as burnin. Prior parameters are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0049445.s013">Text S2</xref>.</p>
        <p>The effective sample size (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e218" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e219" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> samples forms the basis of the comparisons.

The adaptive samplers have greater efficiency in all configurations of the simulations, while KSC shows the poorest performance in these datasets. Multistep moves and delayed rejection increase the efficiency especially in the simulations with 30 causal SNPs, but only in combination with the proposal distribution adaptation. The ESSs are also increased in the non-adaptive samplers with multistep moves, but less so relative to the increase in the sampling time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0049445.s008">Table S2</xref>).

        <p>The move size proposal distribution adaptation was validated by running the adaptive MS and MS-DR samplers with fixed move size proposal distributions for six parameter configurations (giving mean move sizes from 2 to 7) for the 20 simulated datasets with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e224" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and 30 causal SNPs. The results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0049445.s009">Table S3</xref>) indicate that the move size adaptation maximizes the realized jump distance and minimizes the first autocorrelation as intended. However, it seems that the effect of other autocorrelations on ESS is notable and, for this set of parameters and simulations, the larger the proposed move size, the larger the ESS. The differences in relative efficiencies are small (within a factor of 1.2) for the six parameter configurations.</p>
        <p>We further note that the multistep moves and delayed rejection do not necessarily increase the efficiency of moving between different model sizes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0049445.s005">Figure S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0049445.s008">Table S2</xref> show the relative efficiencies when the autocorrelation time is computed for model size samples). A possible explanation is that larger moves reduce the acceptance rate and a notable proportion of the moves jump between models of same size (e.g., 18% of the moves that change the model in the adaptive MS-DR sampler in the simulations with 30 causal SNPs and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e225" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are such, while obviously none are such for the SS sampler; this comparison excludes the additional SNP switch move).

        <title>HDL-C and LDL-C Data</title>
        <p>Only the adaptive samplers proposed here were run for the HDL-C and LDL-C data as the others would be expected to perform worse with the large increase in the number of variables relative to the simulations. Twelve independent chains of length 8,000,000 iterations were run with each sampler and dataset and thinned by taking every tenth sample. Effective sample sizes and sampling times were computed as in the simulations. Here, results are presented as ESS/time rather than as relative efficiencies as there is no additional variation due to multiple datasets (HDL-C and LDL-C results are shown separately). Prior parameters are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0049445.s013">Text S2</xref>.</p>
        <p>Convergence analysis did not indicate problems with the HDL-C dataset. The inferences regarding posterior inclusion probabilities and the proportion of variance explained did not change from the previous analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Peltola1">[4]</xref>, whereas the posterior distribution of model size is here wider reflecting the change in the effect size prior (results not shown). However, the different sampling algorithms did not converge to the same posterior distribution for the LDL-C dataset. Thus, comparisons for sampling efficiency between the samplers are not valid for the LDL-C data. On the other hand, analysis of the convergence problem is interesting.</p>
        <p>The source of the problem is a pair of correlated (Pearsonâ€™s correlation 0.91) SNPs in the <italic>PVRL2</italic> gene, which have weak effects individually but a strong effect together (and preferably in combination with a third near-by SNP, which has a strong individual association). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049445-g004">Figure 4</xref> shows the MCMC traces for these three SNPs in all of the sampled chains. The adaptive SS sampler does not find the pair at all in these 12 chains. Most chains of the adaptive MS sampler include the pair at least at some point, but seem to mix poorly, while mixing is clearly better when delayed rejection is used. All of the samplers picked up the pair, when the dataset was reduced to contain only the SNPs in chromosome 19 (results not shown). The posterior inclusion probability for the pair is 0.79 with the MS-DR sampler. For independent evidence, a p-value of less than 0.000001 for the pair was found by computing Bayes factors using BIMBAM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Guan2">[23]</xref> and a million permutations of the phenotype (after adjusting for the third SNP using linear regression). Similarly computed single-SNP p-values were 0.09 and 0.15 for the two SNPs. The <italic>PVRL2</italic> gene is located near a region with known associations to LDL-C (e.g., the <italic>APOE</italic> gene) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Teslovich1">[24]</xref>.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Several aspects related to the use of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (MH) in Bayesian variable selection in the context of genome-wide association studies were studied here. Specifically, the focus was on the (finite) adaptation of the proposal distributions for additions and removals of variables, multistep proposals (batching of additions and removals) with move size adaptation and using a delayed rejection step in the multistep proposal. A more flexible prior formulation for the effect sizes and additional MH moves tailored to genetic data were also introduced.</p>
      <p>The effect of the adaptation of the proposal distributions was studied on simulated datasets with 85,331 SNPs. The results suggest that the adaptation is beneficial in regard to the sampling efficiency. This is not surprising as similar ideas have been used previously in sampling from high-dimensional model spaces for variable selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Guan1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Peltola1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Nott1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Clyde1">[10]</xref>. The results on simulated data and on the HDL-C dataset imply also that the multistep moves and delayed rejection (DR) are beneficial for the sampling efficiency. The DR step is similar to a block Gibbs update and it allows for oversized multistep moves, where the second stage proposal trims poor updates out. The acceptance rates for MH algorithms in large model spaces are often high and, in such cases, the DR step may also be seen to provide a short-cut relative to full Gibbs moves. The proposed algorithms were also compared to random scan versions of Nott-Kohn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Nott1">[9]</xref> and Kohn-Smith-Chan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Kohn1">[18]</xref> samplers. These seemed to have problems especially in moving along the model size distribution and showed worse performance than the proposed finitely adaptive algorithms in all configurations of the simulated data.</p>
      <p>The expected jump distance optimization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Pasarica1">[13]</xref>, used here for adapting the move size proposals, provides an alternative to relying on the knowledge of an optimal acceptance rate. However, it has two caveats: the optimization does not account for the increase in computational effort for larger move sizes (there is no such problem with a Gaussian proposal distribution) and, in our limited experiments, minimizing the first autocorrelation did not lead to a minimum of the autocorrelation time. The acceptance rates of the multistep moves (without DR) fell in 0.30â€“0.42 for all experiments in this work, which corresponds well with the empirical optimal range of 0.25â€“0.40 found by Lamnisos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Lamnisos2">[25]</xref> in the case of variable selection for probit regression.</p>
      <p>Problems in the mixing of the samplers were found in the LDL-C data. This was identified being related to a pair of SNPs, which are required to be together in the model to have notable contribution. The interpretation of the SNP pair is unclear to us (e.g., haplotype tag or false positive), but it is plausible that such combinations could be found in other datasets also and that they are probably missed in single-SNP analyses. Multistep moves may help in finding such SNP pairs, but it is still improbable that one move would happen to propose the correct pair amongst all possible. We introduced a specific MH move to alleviate the problem of finding such local SNP combinations. Together with the delayed rejection, which allows for some misspecification of move size, this seemed to improve the mixing for the SNP pair markedly.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the prior distribution of the effect sizes was changed to have more probability mass near the axes for the regression coefficients (through having SNP specific <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e241" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> parameters), which may be more appropriate in cases where there are large differences in the effect sizes of associated variables. This seems desirable in genome-wide association analysis. Having a shared <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e242" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> parameter led to multimodal posterior distributions for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0049445.e243" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and model size in the LDL-C data. Such behavior was not observed with the more flexible prior. However, the issue highlights the potential sensitivity of the model size posterior to the prior specification, which has been long acknowledged in the literature on Bayesian varying dimensional models (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049445-Richardson1">[26]</xref>).</p>
      <p>We acknowledge that comparisons for sampling efficiency may be sensitive to the implementation, sampling parameters and the computer environment, where the experiments are run. To this end, all experiments here were run on a cluster computer, where the nodes have almost identical configurations (most importantly, the same CPU model and software libraries for linear algebra; for HDL-C, and similarly for LDL-C, a single node was used to run all experiments) and the same sampling parameters were used for all algorithms (where applicable). Moreover, the third step in the Gibbs scheme, the variable inclusion update, was timed separately and was used to compute the efficiencies. Thus, the time spent in the other steps, which may account for a significant portion of the total time (especially the Rao-Blackwellization), was excluded. All of the algorithms were implemented by the first author and most of the source code is shared between them. A set of unit tests (including checks for likelihood computations and sampling on small test data, among others) was used to increase confidence in the correctness of the implementation and is available with the source code.</p>
      <p>The results may also be expected to vary with the specifics of the data (e.g., scale, number of significant associations, effect size distribution and correlation structure) as seen to some extent between the different simulation configurations. Our experiments were specifically in the context of genome-wide association analysis, but many of the ideas are applicable to other types of high-dimensional data. However, the sampling algorithms used here may need to be combined with other means of tackling potential multimodality for general use.</p>
