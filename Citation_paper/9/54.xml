        <p>Many types of epigenetic profiling have been used to classify stem cells, stages of cellular differentiation, and cancer subtypes. Existing methods focus on local chromatin features such as DNA methylation and histone modifications that require extensive analysis for genome-wide coverage. Replication timing has emerged as a highly stable cell type-specific epigenetic feature that is regulated at the megabase-level and is easily and comprehensively analyzed genome-wide. Here, we describe a cell classification method using 67 individual replication profiles from 34 mouse and human cell lines and stem cell-derived tissues, including new data for mesendoderm, definitive endoderm, mesoderm and smooth muscle. Using a Monte-Carlo approach for selecting features of replication profiles conserved in each cell type, we identify “replication timing fingerprints” unique to each cell type and apply a k nearest neighbor approach to predict known and unknown cell types. Our method correctly classifies 67/67 independent replication-timing profiles, including those derived from closely related intermediate stages. We also apply this method to derive fingerprints for pluripotency in human and mouse cells. Interestingly, the mouse pluripotency fingerprint overlaps almost completely with previously identified genomic segments that switch from early to late replication as pluripotency is lost. Thereafter, replication timing and transcription within these regions become difficult to reprogram back to pluripotency, suggesting these regions highlight an epigenetic barrier to reprogramming. In addition, the major histone cluster Hist1 consistently becomes later replicating in committed cell types, and several histone H1 genes in this cluster are downregulated during differentiation, suggesting a possible instrument for the chromatin compaction observed during differentiation. Finally, we demonstrate that unknown samples can be classified independently using site-specific PCR against fingerprint regions. In sum, replication fingerprints provide a comprehensive means for cell characterization and are a promising tool for identifying regions with cell type-specific organization.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>While continued advances in stem cell and cancer biology have uncovered a growing list of clinical applications for stem cell technology, errors in indentifying cell lines have undermined a number of recent studies, highlighting a growing need for improvements in cell typing methods for both basic biological and clinical applications of stem cells. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)—adult cells reprogrammed to a pluripotent state—show great promise for patient-specific stem cell treatments, but more efficient derivation of iPSCs depends on a more comprehensive understanding of pluripotency. Here, we describe a method to identify sets of regions that replicate at unique times in any given cell type (replication timing fingerprints) using pluripotent stem cells as an example, and show that genes in the pluripotency fingerprint belong to a class previously shown to be resistant to reprogramming in iPSCs, identifying potential new target genes for more efficient iPSC production. We propose that the order in which DNA is replicated (replication timing) provides a novel means for classifying cell types, and can reveal cell type specific features of genome organization.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In mammals, replication of the genome occurs in large, coordinately firing regions called replication domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Yaffe1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Desprat1">[7]</xref>. These domains are typically one to several megabases, roughly align to genomic features such as isochores, and are closely tied to subnuclear position, with transitions to the nuclear interior often coupled to earlier replication, and transitions to the periphery to later replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Hiratani1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Hiratani2">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Yokochi1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Berezney1">[9]</xref>. Given their connections to subnuclear position and remarkably strong correlation to chromatin interaction maps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Ryba1">[3]</xref>, replication profiles provide a window into large-scale genome organization changes important for establishing cellular identity. The organization of replication domains is cell-type specific, and a larger number of smaller replication domains is a property of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Ryba1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Hiratani2">[5]</xref>. Importantly, in both humans and mice, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) reprogrammed from fibroblasts display a timing profile almost indistinguishable from ESCs, suggesting that replication profiles may also be used to measure cellular potency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Ryba1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Hiratani2">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>While a wide-range of cell classification methods are actively used, the most common practice for verifying identity is to monitor a handful of molecular markers, some of which are shared with other cell types. Genome-wide classification of features such as DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Marsit1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Baron1">[12]</xref>, transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Sotiriou1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Hou1">[14]</xref> and histone modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Elsheikh1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Barlsi1">[16]</xref> have in principle more potential to accurately distinguish specific cell types. However, these features of chromatin are highly dynamic at any given genomic site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Voss1">[17]</xref>, and most measurements require high-resolution arrays and costly antibodies. Moreover, recent reports highlight the unstable nature of transcription and related epigenetic marks in multiple embryonic stem cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Chang1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Efroni1">[19]</xref>. By contrast, since replication is regulated at the level of large domains, replication profiles are considerably less complex to generate and interpret than other molecular profiles. Timing changes occurring during differentiation are on the order of several hundred kilobases and are highly reproducible between various stem cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Ryba1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Hiratani2">[5]</xref>. They are also robust to changes in individual chromatin modifications, retaining their normal developmental pattern in G9a(−/−) cells despite strong upregulation of G9a target genes and near-complete loss of H3K9me2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Yokochi1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here, we describe a method for classifying cell types—replication fingerprinting—based on genome-wide replication timing patterns in mouse and human ESCs and other cell types. We applied the method to 67 (36 mouse and 31 human) whole-genome replication timing datasets to demonstrate the feasibility of classifying cell types using a minimal set of cell type-specific regions. After identification, these regions were used to classify two independent samples using site-specific PCR. We also demonstrate that loss of pluripotency is accompanied by consistent changes in replication timing, implicating the replication program as an important factor in maintaining pluripotency and revealing a novel fingerprint for pluripotent stem cells.</p>

        <title>Generation of replication profiles</title>
        <p>In addition to our previously reported replication profiles, BG02 hESCs were differentiated to mesendoderm and definitive endoderm as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-McLean1">[20]</xref>, as well as ISL+ mesoderm and smooth muscle cultured in defined medium (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), and profiled for replication. Replication profiles were generated as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Ryba1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Hiratani2">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Schbeler1">[21]</xref>. In brief, nascent DNA fractions were collected in early and late S-phase, differentially labeled, and co-hybridized to a whole-genome CGH microarray. The ratio of early and late fraction abundance for each probe—“replication timing ratio”—represents its relative time of replication. Values from individual probes are then smoothed using LOESS (a locally weighted smoothing function), and plotted on log scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002225-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

        <title>Generation of replication fingerprints</title>
        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002225-g001">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the basic concept of replication fingerprinting. Two exemplary profiles each for D3 embryonic stem cells (ESCs; blue) and D3 ESC-derived neural precursor cells (NPCs; green) are overlaid. Given that most of the genome is conserved in replication timing between any two cell types (e.g. 80% conserved between ESCs and NPCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Hiratani1">[4]</xref>), the first challenge is to choose genomic regions that are differentially replicated within a set of cell types. We define a “replication fingerprint” of a cell type as a set of genomic regions useful for classification, along with their associated replication timing values. For a simplified example, we show exemplary fingerprint regions for a segment of chromosome 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002225-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, gray bars). Note that the four regions change dramatically upon differentiation to neural precursors (e.g., ESC2 vs. NPC1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002225-g001">Figure 1A,B</xref>), but have replication timing values that are well conserved between replicate experiments (e.g., ESC1 vs. ESC2). We and others have observed similarly widespread changes in replication profiles between any two different cell types profiled to date <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Yaffe1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Ryba1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Hiratani2">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Desprat1">[7]</xref>.</p>
        <p>As classification methods require a measure of distance between samples, we defined the distance between replication profiles as the sum of absolute differences in replication timing in fingerprinting regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002225-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). To select an optimal set of fingerprinting regions we maximize a “distance ratio,” representing the ratio of the average distance between unlike cell types to the average distance between equivalent cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002225-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This ratio is maximized by selecting regions that are consistently different in replication timing between different cell types, but consistently similar between equivalent types. Importantly, the assignment of unlike vs. equivalent cell types is user-defined and flexible, allowing selection of features that best distinguish any group of cells from any other, such as ESCs from NPCs, normal from disease-related cells, or pluripotent from committed cells.</p>
        <p>While <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002225-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows a simplified example of four regions distinguishing ESCs from NPCs, real-world classification requires the ability to make distinctions genome-wide between many cell types, making manual selection of regions impractical. Therefore, to make the method generally applicable, we developed an automated algorithm based on Monte Carlo sampling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Hastings1">[23]</xref> to select regions that best distinguish between all available cell types in genome-wide replication datasets. Alternative approaches evaluated for feature selection and classification included Bayesian networks, nearest neighbor methods, decision trees and SVMs, which were comparably successful only for smaller collections of cell types. We chose to explicitly maximize distances between cell types in the method described here in anticipation of translating cell classification to more convenient empirical assays with a limited number of features, because larger timing differences are easier to verify empirically and are more robust to experimental and biological variation.</p>

        <title>Monte Carlo optimization of fingerprint regions</title>
        <p>In practice, replication fingerprinting is a feature selection problem. Although most genome-wide approaches are both simple and comprehensive, we found that genome-wide correlations and distances, while a good first approximation of the relatedness between cell types, are not ideal for classification as the small amount of noise in regions with conserved replication timing is compounded over this relatively large fraction of the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002225.s001">Figure S1</xref>). We therefore wish to exclude domains that are noisy (having high technical or biological variability), irrelevant (conserved in all cell types), or redundant (containing overlapping information). To achieve this, we first remove regions with conserved replication timing between cell types, resulting in a set of informative regions that can be further optimized by a Monte Carlo selection algorithm.</p>
        <p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002225.s002">Figure S2</xref> depicts the Monte Carlo algorithm. To reduce noise from individual probe measurements, replication profiles are first averaged into nonoverlapping windows of approximately 200 kb. This window size represents a balance between sizes of the regions that change replication timing during development (400–800 kb), and the number of probes needed for timing changes to be deemed statistically significant (35–180 probes are contained in each window depending on the probe density of the array platform; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002225.s015">Table S2</xref>). An initial set of regions with the highest replication timing changes in the set of replication profiles are chosen to exclude regions with conserved replication timing, and half of these starting regions are randomly selected to calculate initial distances between cell types. At each iteration of the algorithm, a region can be added to the set of fingerprint regions, removed from the set, or swapped with an unused region. Using a Metropolis-Hastings criterion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Hastings1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Metropolis1">[24]</xref>, moves that improve the overall distance ratio are accepted with higher probability than those that do not; after 20,000 or more such moves, a final set of fingerprinting regions is selected.</p>
        <p>As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002225-g002">Figure 2</xref>, the fingerprinting algorithm selects domains with large and reproducible replication timing differences between cell types, discarding those with minimal or variable changes. Before selecting optimal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002225-g002">Figure 2A,C</xref>), the average distance between “like” and “unlike” cell types are similar, translating into classification errors for randomly selected domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002225-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) as well as the whole genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002225.s001">Figure S1</xref>, red shading). After selection, the separation in distances between like and unlike types becomes very distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002225-g002">Figure 2B, D</xref>), even for closely related cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002225-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

        <p>Since Monte Carlo selection is stochastic, different sets of fingerprinting regions can be selected in different runs. To evaluate the stability of regions included in replication fingerprints, we applied the algorithm 100 times for each type of human and mouse fingerprint constructed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002225.s013">Figure S13</xref>). Results demonstrate that fingerprinting regions are well-conserved among multiple rounds of selection, with the top 10–14 regions selected in 100/100 trials in each case. For all subsequent classification, we used regions included in at least 75/100 fingerprinting runs.</p>
        <p>As the distances between profiles derive from either the same or different cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002225-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), their distributions can be used to create a general classifier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002225-g002">Figure 2C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002225-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), with an error rate proportional to the overlap in distances shared by “like” and “unlike” cell type comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002225-g002">Figure 2C,D</xref>, blue shading). This allows us to state a level of confidence for a given prediction, as well as estimate the similarity of a cell type to others. To refine this classification, we applied the k-nearest-neighbor rule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Cover1">[25]</xref> (kNN; k = 3) to assign cell types according to the three most similar profiles in the training set. Distances below the threshold – θ = 2.4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002225-g002">Figure 2D</xref> – are hypothesized to derive from similar cell types, and are used with kNN to classify profiles according to the closest profiles in the training set. Distances above the threshold are presumed to derive from different cell types, preventing kNN from classifying highly divergent RT profiles as the cell type of the most similar known profile.</p>

        <p>To test the ability of our method to select suitable regions for classification, we applied it to predict the known identity of 9 mouse and 7 human cell types with 36 and 31 total experimental replicates, respectively.

Strikingly, even closely related cell types could be reliably distinguished using this method, such as mouse ESCs and early primitive ectoderm-like stem cells (EPL/EBM3), and two day intermediates of human ESC differentiation into endomesoderm (DE2; day 2) and definitive endoderm (DE4; day 4).

        <title>Confirmation and generalizability of replication fingerprints</title>
        <p>The use of all experimental data in a selection algorithm often results in overfitting the model to a limited set of observations. For this reason, machine-learning algorithms are commonly trained and tested on different subsets of data (termed cross-validation). To determine whether overfitting is occurring in our selection method and assess the degree to which fingerprinting domains are generally cell type-specific, we performed leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) with each of the available experiments by constructing fingerprints using all but one experimental replicate, and testing classification on the remaining replicate. In all cases (31/31 human, 36/36 mouse), correct predictions in the excluded profile confirmed that fingerprinting regions remained consistent with cell type, and that most cell-line-specific differences were discarded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002225-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, LOOCV column). This was also true for a cell line with only one replicate (mouse 46C neural precursor cells), implying that most of the regions of differential replication timing useful for classification are shared between cell lines.</p>
        <p>To simulate the classification of a cell type not yet encountered in the training set, we tested predictions after selecting fingerprinting regions with all replicates of a given cell type excluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002225-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, LCTO column). This confirmed that most cell types not yet encountered were correctly classified as “Unseen” (7/7 cell types in human, 7/9 in mouse). However, two cases in which profiles were ambiguous were between neural precursors (NPCs) and mouse epiblast-like stem cells (EpiSCs, EBM6), suggesting that closely related cell types are more accurately distinguished when examples of each type are included in the training set.</p>

        <title>A replication fingerprint for pluripotency</title>
        <p>One of the most striking features of replication timing is its widespread consolidation into larger replication domains during neural differentiation, concomitant with global compaction of chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Ryba1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Hiratani1">[4]</xref>. This consolidation, along with recovery of ESC replication timing by induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), suggested that replication patterns in specific regions of the genome are associated with the pluripotent state. Further, if certain timing changes are a stable property of cellular commitment, they may provide a unique opportunity to evaluate differentiation capacity using replication-timing patterns. To explore this, we analyzed the differences in replication profiles between collections of pluripotent/reversible (ESCs, iPSCs, EBM3) and committed cell types in 13 human and 21 mouse cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002225-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In each case, we created a stringent consensus fingerprint for classification consisting of regions found in &gt;75/100 runs (18 regions each in mouse and human), and examined genes in the top 200 fingerprint regions (∼2% of the genome) to characterize a more inclusive sample.

        <p>Strikingly, several regions displayed conserved, significant differences in timing between all pluripotent and committed cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002225-g004">Figures 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002225.s010">S10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002225.s012">S12</xref>). As with general fingerprints, classification into pluripotent or committed types could be performed unambiguously (36/36 cases in mouse, 31/31 in human), even with regions selected with the test profile excluded (LOOCV column). Several of the genes consistently switching to later replication in mouse and human pluripotency fingerprints have known roles in maintaining pluripotency (for instance, Dppa2 and Dppa4 in both species, and DKK1 in human; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002225.s017">Tables S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002225.s019">S6</xref>). In addition, two classes of genes stood out from this analysis that showed significant switches to later replication in both species: a large cluster of protocadherins (PCDs), and the majority of the Hist1 cluster of core histone genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002225.s020">Table S7</xref>). The former are developmentally regulated genes with broad involvement in neural development and cell-cell signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Sano1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Angst1">[27]</xref>, and switch to later replication in all committed mouse and human cell types. The latter Hist1 cluster was later replicating in 8/8 committed cell types in mouse and 5/6 in human (not lymphoblasts), and includes several core histone genes that were downregulated up to 2.5-fold in NPCs. These results are intriguing in light of previous reports of histone downregulation during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Gerbaulet1">[28]</xref>, as well as a hyperdynamic chromatin phenotype in ESCs that involves higher exchange rates of histone H1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Meshorer1">[29]</xref> and is required for efficient somatic cell nuclear reprogramming in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Jullien1">[30]</xref>. Importantly, all of the histone H1 genes are found in this cluster, suggesting that regulation of global H1 abundance may provide a mechanism for the overall chromatin compaction and consolidation of replication timing observed during neural differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Ryba1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Hiratani2">[5]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To characterize the genes included in the mouse pluripotency fingerprint, we compared them to a previous class of genes that showed lineage-independent switches to later replication in mouse ESC differentiation, and failed to revert to ESC-like expression in three separately derived samples of partial iPSCs (clusters 15 and 16 in Figure 7 of Hiratani et al., 2010). Remarkably, 200 out of 217 genes in the top 100 mouse pluripotency regions belonged to this class, despite very different methods for deriving them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002225-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). All of the fingerprint genes switched to later replication, and at the transition between early and late epiblast stages where cell fates become restricted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Hiratani2">[5]</xref>. Most genes also had reduced expression in late epiblast and neural progenitor stages (average 1.66-fold reduction in transcription from ESC/EBM3 to EBM6/NPCs). Thus, some of these genes may make prime candidates for improving the efficiency of iPSC production, or for reverting human ESCs to a more naive, mouse ESC-like state. However, the overlap between human and mouse pluripotency fingerprint genes, while significant, was much lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002225-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), and this was true even when comparing human ESCs to developmentally analogous mouse EpiSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Ryba1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Tesar1">[31]</xref>. Therefore, many pluripotency-associated genes and loci may be species-specific, consistent with recent studies that underscore considerable differences between mouse and human pluripotency networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Ginis1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Heng1">[33]</xref>. This low alignment is also accounted for by a general drop in overall alignment in regions with the greatest developmental switches in replication timing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002225-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), which are those preferentially selected by the fingerprinting algorithm.</p>

        <p>One potential application of replication fingerprints is in the development of PCR kits for epigenetic classification, particularly for cell types or disease samples with no known aberrations in transcription or sequence. To confirm that fingerprint regions can be translated into a classification scheme using site-specific PCR, we classified two unknown samples representing cell types that were analyzed previously, but that were derived from different cell lines than the original set used for training. The experiment was performed in a blind manner in which the experimenter had no prior knowledge of the regions or cell types being tested. Primers were assembled against sequences within 10–20 kb from the center of each fingerprint region, and the replication times of each region were quantified as the “relative early S phase abundance” (relative abundance of a sequence in nascent strands from early S phase), as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Hiratani3">[35]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002225-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).

        <title>Advantages and caveats of replication profiles for cell typing</title>
        <p>Our method for cell typing through replication fingerprinting addresses a well-recognized need for comprehensive methods to assess cellular identity and differentiation potential in stem cell biology. Unlike other molecular markers, replication is regulated at the level of large, multi-megabase domains, making comprehensive, genome-wide profiles relatively simple to generate and interpret <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Pope1">[36]</xref>. In particular, the robust stability of replication timing profiles in stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Yokochi1">[8]</xref>, and wide divergence between cell types make them a promising candidate for classification.</p>
        <p>While the functional role for the replication program is not yet understood, its conservation between human and mouse cell culture models of development support its functional significance. We and others have shown a substantial correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.42–0.53) in replication patterns between mouse and human cell types, with timing patterns of embryonic stem cells, neural precursor cells, and lymphoblastoid cells most closely aligned to their cognate in the other species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Yaffe1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Ryba1">[3]</xref>. The important role for replication is further corroborated by its remarkably strong link to genome organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Ryba1">[3]</xref>, and its ability to confirm the mouse epiblast identity of human ESCs genome-wide and with an epigenetic property <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Ryba1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Tesar1">[31]</xref>.</p>
        <p>By comparison, methods for cell typing using DNA methylation, gene expression, histone modifications or protein markers are well suited to some applications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Marsit1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Barlsi1">[16]</xref>, but may not be informative for certain fractions of the genome, or may rely on genome features that cannot distinguish between similar cell states. We therefore envision replication fingerprinting as a complement to existing cell typing strategies that may be used for samples unsuitable for traditional methods, or for additional confidence in assessing cell identity in cases where this is critical, such as regenerative medicine. One caveat to consider in these applications is that replication profiles, similar to other genome-wide methods, are an ensemble aggregate from many cells, making measurement of homogeneity difficult. In addition, as with other supervised classification approaches, the method is informative only for cell types (classes) available during training. However, our fingerprinting method is in principle applicable to any data type, and may be modified to select discriminating features in other epigenetic profiles.</p>
        <p>A major advantage of our fingerprinting method is in selection of a minimal set of regions that allow for classification with a straightforward PCR-based timing assay and a reasonably small set of primers, particularly if only cell-type specific regions are examined. Our results suggest that a standard set of 20 fingerprint loci can be effective for classification, but the number of regions queried can be adjusted based on the confidence level required. The sole requirement for replication profiling is the collection of a sufficient number of proliferating cells for sorting on a flow cytometer. Consistently, just as replication fingerprints can be generated for particular cell types or general categories of cells, features of replication profiles allow for the creation of disease-specific fingerprints, which may be valuable for prognosis.</p>

        <title>Consistent timing changes between pluripotent and committed cell types</title>
        <p>In addition to cell typing applications, replication profiling is informative for basic biological questions. Here, we have identified regions that may undergo important organizational changes upon differentiation, which include a class of gene that fail to reverse expression in partial iPSCs, and the majority of mouse and human histone H1 genes. Human lymphoblasts retained early replication in H1 genes, which may be explained by their high rate of proliferation. Since highly developmentally plastic regions (including pluripotency fingerprint regions) are poorly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002225-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) the evolutionary conservation of cell-type specific timing patterns must be driven by the moderately changing majority of the genome.</p>
        <p>The recent derivation of mouse ESC-like human stem cells with various methods raises an intriguing question <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Hanna1">[37]</xref>: will naïve hESCs align better to mESCs than to mEpiSCs for replication timing as they have for transcription? Although pluripotency is currently assessed by marker gene expression or laborious complementation experiments, replication timing assays in regions uniquely early or late replicating in pluripotent cells provide a tractable method to predict the pluripotency of various cell types, as well as insights into conserved genome organizational changes during differentiation.</p>

Crossvalidation was performed to select an appropriate value for k, with k = 3 chosen as the smallest value that yielded 100% classification accuracy after leave-one-out crossvalidation (LOOCV) to allow classification of cell types with fewer replicates. For LOOCV results, each experiment was sequentially left out during Monte Carlo selection, and the resulting regions were used to predict the identity of the excluded experiment. To test prediction on cell types not yet encountered, all profiles for a given cell type were left out during region selection (LCTO), and cell type was predicted using the resulting regions.

        <p>PCR reactions were set up using 1.25 ng genomic DNA and 1 uM each of forward and reverse primers in 12.5 uL scaled according to the instructions of Crimson Taq DNA Polymerase (NEB). Thirty six cycles of PCR (empirically determined to be unsaturated for amplification) were performed according to manufacturer's conditions with annealing temperature of 62°C. One-third of the reaction was analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. The gel was scanned by Typhoon Trio (GE Healthcare) and band intensity was quantified by Image Quant TL (GE Healthcare). After the background was subtracted, signal intensity from the early S fraction was divided by the sum of those from early S and late S fractions from each sample, as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002225-Hiratani3">[35]</xref>. PCR timing values were converted to array RT scale (equivalent root-mean-square) using the scale function in R, and distances were calculated against other cell types as previously performed.</p>

          <p><bold>The Monte Carlo optimization algorithm.</bold> A. Regions used in replication fingerprints are selected using a two step algorithm. First, 200 kb segments with significant changes in replication timing between any two cell types are isolated. Next, a random set of these segments are sampled to calculate a distance ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002225-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) representing the starting separation between cell types, and an iterative algorithm randomly selects between one of three moves: 1) include an unused region in the fingerprint, 2) remove a region from the fingerprint, or 3) swap regions between fingerprint and unused lists. By the Metropolis-Hastings criterion, moves that improve the separation between cell types (increase the distance ratio criterion) are accepted with a higher probability than those that do not. B. Maximization of the distance ratio (left) as domain number (right) decreases to a predetermined minimum (here, n = 20).</p>
