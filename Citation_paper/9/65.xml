Here we develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for estimating epidemiological parameters of the 2001 outbreak for a range of simple transmission models. We make the simplifying assumption that infectious farms were completely observed in 2001, equivalent to assuming that farms that were proactively culled but not diagnosed with FMD were not infectious, even if some were infected. We estimate how transmission parameters varied through time, highlighting the impact of the control measures on the progression of the epidemic. We demonstrate statistically significant evidence for assortative contact patterns between animals of the same species. Predictive risk maps of the transmission potential in different geographic areas of GB are presented for the fitted models.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Department of Environmental and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), UK BBRSC, UK</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The 2001 FMD epidemic in the UK had a substantial cost in human, animal health and economic terms (Alexandersen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-Alexandersen1">[1]</xref>, Kao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-Kao1">[2]</xref>). Understanding the risk factors underlying the transmission dynamics of that epidemic and evaluating the effectiveness of the control measures are essential to minimise the scale and cost of any future outbreak.

Modelling now has a ‘peace-time’ contingency planning role.</p><p>One weakness of the modelling studies undertaken in 2001 was the relatively ad-hoc nature of the parameter estimation methods employed. In their first paper, Ferguson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-Ferguson2">[4]</xref> used maximum likelihood methods to fit to the observed incidence time series, but did not attempt to fit to the spatio-temporal pattern of spread. In their later work, the same authors developed a more robust method for estimating species-specific susceptibility and infectiousness parameters and spatial kernel parameters (see Supplementary Information to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-Ferguson1">[3]</xref>), but at the time the statistical basis for the methods developed was lacking. In retrospect, the methods developed turned out to be closely related to those developed during the SARS epidemic by Wallinga and Teunis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-Wallinga1">[11]</xref>, although the earlier work incorporated population denominator data to allow for spatial- and species-based heterogeneity in disease transmission. Nevertheless, the methods employed had the limitation of not being fully parametric, meaning they could not be extended to fit arbitrary transmission models to the observed data. Keeling et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-Keeling1">[5]</xref> used maximum likelihood methods to estimate transmission parameters, but it was also supplemented by more ad hoc least-squares matching to regional incidence time series.</p><p>Therefore there remains a need to develop rigorous modern statistical approaches for parameter estimation of non-linear models for the 2001 FMD outbreak. Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques are the best established such methods and have been successfully employed in the analysis of a range of spatiotemporal outbreak data in the past <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-Gibson1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-Gibson3">[14]</xref>, as well as to purely temporal incidence data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-Finkenstadt1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-ONeill1">[16]</xref>. Here we develop MCMC-based inference models for the 2001 FMD epidemic in GB. The models examine: the extent to which transmission was spatially localised and the temporal variation in transmission, species-specific variation in susceptibility, infectiousness and heterogeneity in contact rates between and within species.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Data</title><p>We take the farm as the unit of our study and ignore the possible impact of within-farm epidemic dynamics. Thus we implicitly assume disease spread within a farm is so rapid as to be practically instantaneous, with all animals on a farm becoming infectious at the same time.</p><p>Our data consists of information on all the farms in the UK listed in the 2000 agricultural census [see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/footandmouth/cases/index.htm" xlink:type="simple">http://www.defra.gov.uk/footandmouth/cases/index.htm</ext-link> ]. There were a total of 134,986 farms listed in that dataset and uniquely identified by their County/Parish/Holding (CPH) number. Their spatial coordinates are provided together with the number of animals by species within each farm. A partition of all GB farms according to the animal types represented is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000502-g001">Figure 1a</xref>. Their geographical distribution is represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000502-g001">Figure 1b</xref> as the number of farms per 5×5 km. Notice the high density areas in the North West (Cumbria), South West (Devon), Wales and Scotland where the main epidemic foci developed. There is also an area of high density in the Shetland Islands corresponding to very small crofter smallholdings. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000502-g001">Figure 1c and d</xref> show the numbers of sheep and cattle kept per 5×5 km square.</p><fig id="pone-0000502-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000502.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>GB livestock population in 2000.</title><p>(a) GB livestock farms partitioned according to the animal species kept.

The IP dataset contains, for each farm, the estimated date of infection (determined by a clinical evaluation of the age of lesions on affected animals), and the dates of disease reporting, confirmation and culling.</p><p>A total of 7457 other (non-IP) farms were also culled – mostly as <italic>contiguous premises</italic> (CPs, about 3103) or <italic>dangerous contacts</italic> (DCs, about 1287), but some under other local culling policies used in Cumbria and Scotland. For instance about 1846 (79%) out of a total of 2342 sheep farms in Cumbria had all sheep culled under the “local 3 km radial sheep cull” policy adopted there. Some of the farms (about 30) were recorded both as DCs and CPs. Multiple records per farm were often found in the disease control management system dataset, and it was often unclear whether this was due to data entry errors or as a result of sequential species-specific culls on the same farm. In our analysis we therefore considered the whole farm to be culled at the last recorded date of culling.</p><p>The most frequent species are cattle and sheep (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000502-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). There are less than 3% farms with pigs only and only 10 farms with just pigs were diagnosed as IPs in 2001 (less than 1% of all the IPs). This indicates a-priori that pigs contributed far less to the 2001 outbreak than many other FMD outbreaks (despite their high levels of shedding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-Alexandersen1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-Howard1">[17]</xref>), and we therefore decided to discard pigs-only farms from the current study to simplify the analysis. The Sensitivity Analysis section shows that this simplification does not significantly affect estimates of other epidemiological parameters. We discarded another three IPs due to missing information or possible mistakes regarding their location or number of animals, leaving a total of 2013 IPs in our analysed dataset.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Model formulation</title><p>We model the epidemic as a space-time survival process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-Cressie1">[18]</xref>. The total observation time <italic>T</italic> is the 240 days between 7<sup>th</sup> February and 5<sup>th</sup> October 2001. Each farm <italic>i</italic> at the location (<italic>x<sub>i</sub></italic>, <italic>y<sub>i</sub></italic>) is associated with an infection time <italic>t<sub>i</sub></italic> (if infected), a removal time <italic>r<sub>i</sub></italic> (if slaughtered) and two integers <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000502.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000502.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> representing, respectively, the number of cattle and sheep on the farm. <italic>S<sub>c</sub></italic> and <italic>S<sub>s</sub></italic> represent per-capita cattle and sheep susceptibility, respectively, while <italic>I<sub>c</sub></italic> and <italic>I<sub>s</sub></italic> represent per capita cattle and sheep infectivity. The susceptibility is a relative measure of animal sensitivity to the disease whereas infectivity represents the infectious risk posed by an animal to others. We use a continuous kernel to describe how the probability of contact between farms scaled with distance. Transmission is naturally assumed to decrease with the distance between farms according to the power law<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000502.e003" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>d<sub>ij</sub></italic> represents the Euclidian distance between the infected farm <italic>i</italic> and the susceptible farm <italic>j</italic>. The parameters <italic>a</italic> (kernel offset) and γ (kernel power) are to be estimated. The kernel captures all forms of movement and contact between farms and as such, the use of a simple 2 parameter function is inevitably a highly simplified representation of the true complexity of inter-farm contacts. We examined other functional forms for the kernel (such as those used in some other analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-Diggle1">[19]</xref>) but the resulting model fits were much poorer than found using the power-law kernel above.</p><p>Given the susceptibility and infectiousness parameters and the kernel, the infection hazard from an infected farm <italic>j</italic> to a susceptible farm <italic>i</italic> is then quantified by<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000502.e004" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>This model is over-specified as stated, so we arbitrarily assume <italic>S<sub>s</sub></italic> = 1 throughout, meaning <italic>S<sub>c</sub></italic> represents the ratio of cattle-to-sheep susceptibility. For a constant (distance-independent) kernel this is just a mass-action closed epidemic model with heterogeneous susceptibility and infectiousness. This model assumes susceptibility and infectiousness parameters scale linearly with the number of animals of different species on the farm, a relatively strong assumption imposed for model parsimony reasons. The mixing matrix embedded in (2) quantifies the 4 species-specific mixing rates between animals on different farms: cattle-to-cattle (<italic>S<sub>c</sub>I<sub>c</sub></italic>) sheep-to-cattle (<italic>S<sub>c</sub>I<sub>s</sub></italic>), cattle-to-sheep (<italic>S<sub>s</sub>I<sub>c</sub></italic>) and sheep-to-sheep (<italic>S<sub>s</sub>I<sub>s</sub></italic>). This model formulation is identical to that used by Keeling et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-Keeling1">[5]</xref>, except for the functional form of kernel used.</p><p>The <italic>force of infection</italic> on a <italic>susceptible</italic> farm <italic>i</italic> at time <italic>t</italic> depends on the whole history of events and is just<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000502.e005" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>where<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000502.e006" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula>By default, we assume a latent period of 1 day (latency is represented within the function <italic>L</italic>); i.e. farms are infectious the day after they are infected. However, we test the sensitivity of our estimates to the assumption by also examining latent periods of 2 and 3 days.</p><p>The probability density function that farm <italic>i</italic> is infected at time <italic>t</italic> is then given by<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000502.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>Hence, the contribution that a farm <italic>i</italic>, observed to be infected at time <italic>t</italic>, makes to the log likelihood is just:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000502.e008" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula>A farm which is not infected contributes to the overall likelihood the probability that it escapes infection during the observation period, i.e. until the time it is culled (<italic>r<sub>i</sub></italic>) or for the duration of the epidemic <italic>T</italic>, whichever is shorter.

The parameter ρ quantifies the degree to which mixing between species is assortative – with ρ&lt;1 representing assortative mixing and ρ&gt;1 disassortative mixing. The interaction model still assumes constant parameters with respect to time along the whole observation period <italic>T</italic>. The mixing matrix defined in equation (2) becomes<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000502.e011" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(8)</label></disp-formula>where we again fix <italic>S<sub>s</sub></italic> to be 1 to avoid model over specification. The force of infection (3) and model log likelihood equation (7) change accordingly.</p><p>Assuming transmission parameters were constant in time throughout the epidemic is obviously a crude simplification. However, allowing infectivity to vary continuously in time results in an over-specified model and problems of parameter identification and confounding. We therefore examined two sets of models in which changes in transmission parameter were restricted to 2 significant points in time denoted by <italic>T<sub>cut</sub></italic>, namely 23<sup>rd</sup> February (when the national ban on animal movements was introduced) and 31<sup>st</sup> March (when control measures were intensified and the so called 24/48 hour IP/CP culling policy was introduced). Models were respectively fitted to the individual case data from the start of the epidemic (conditioning on the first infection) or from after 23rd February (conditioning on the 54 farms that were already infected by that date). A detailed history of the epidemic is given by Kao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-Kao2">[9]</xref>.</p><p>We separately fitted model variants which assumed a discrete change in parameters on 23<sup>rd</sup> February and on 31<sup>st</sup> March. Confounding meant that only a very limited number of parameters could be varied in time, so we examined the effect of varying infectiousness and kernel parameters separately. We fitted four separate time-varying model variants: (i) varying the cattle infectivity by a factor and keeping sheep infectivity constant through time (Cattle Infectivity model); (ii) varying sheep infectivity by a factor but not cattle infectivity (Sheep Infectivity model); (iii) varying both cattle and sheep infectivity by the same ratio (Cattle &amp; Sheep Infectivity model); (iv) varying the kernel parameters (Time Varying Kernel model). For the last model variant we also fitted a version which includes non-assortative mixing between species (see equation (8)). Hence the most general mathematical expression of the transmission model is:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000502.e012" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(9)</label></disp-formula>where<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000502.e013" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(10)</label></disp-formula>The scripts <italic>pre</italic> and <italic>post</italic> are self-explanatory for time varying parameters. When fitting models with time varying infectivity parameters we actually fit <italic>I<sup>post</sup></italic> and the ratio μ = <italic>I<sup>pre</sup>/I<sup>post</sup></italic> we called infectivity factor. This is a within species ratio, a parameter directly fitted by the models, unlike the between species infectivity ratio additionally calculated as explained later in the text (see Parameter estimates section).</p><p>Note that all models above treat the epidemic as fully observed, i.e. infection times are assumed to be known (when in fact only estimated infection times are known – see Sensitivity Analysis section), and only IPs are assumed to be infectious.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Statistical inference and model comparison</title><p>We adopt a Bayesian framework for statistical inference and use MCMC methods for fitting the model to individual case data. This is not strictly necessary, given our simplifying assumption that the epidemic was completely observed, but it provides a more consistent and robust framework within which to relax that assumption in future work.</p><p>We obtained parameter estimates and equal-tailed 95% credible intervals from the marginal posterior distributions of the fitted parameters. For the basic model for instance we estimated the relative cattle susceptibility, <italic>S<sub>c</sub></italic>, two infectivity parameters (<italic>I<sub>c</sub></italic>(<italic>t</italic>)≡<italic>I<sub>c</sub></italic> and <italic>I<sub>s</sub></italic>(<italic>t</italic>)≡<italic>I<sub>s</sub></italic> for all <italic>t</italic>) and two kernel parameters (γ(<italic>t</italic>)≡γ<italic><sup>post</sup></italic>≡γ<italic><sup>pre</sup></italic>≡γ and <italic>a</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)≡<italic>a<sup>post</sup></italic>≡<italic>a<sup>pre</sup></italic>≡<italic>a</italic> for all <italic>t</italic>).</p><p>We used the posterior mean deviance as a Bayesian measure of fit or model adequacy as defined by Spiegelhalter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-Spiegelhalter1">[20]</xref>. The posterior density deviance is defined as:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000502.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where log{<italic>P</italic>(<italic>y</italic>|<bold>θ</bold>)} is the log-likelihood function for the observed data vector <italic>y</italic> given the parameter vector <bold>θ</bold> and <italic>C</italic> is a constant which does not need to be known for model-comparison purposes (being a function of the data alone). The smaller the mean posterior deviance, the better the corresponding model fits the data.</p><p>If the posterior deviance distributions for two different models overlap significantly, it is necessary to use additional criteria to compare model fit – namely a comparison of the relative complexity of the models. The Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) is perhaps the most general of such methods, being a generalisation of the Akaike information criterion for Bayesian hierarchical models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-Spiegelhalter1">[20]</xref>. We define the complexity of a model by its effective number of parameters, <italic>p<sub>D</sub></italic>, defined as<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000502.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where E[ ] represents taking expectations (the posterior average). The DIC is then defined as<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000502.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p><p>A lower value of DIC corresponds to a better model. This criterion offers flexibility for comparing non-nested models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-Spiegelhalter1">[20]</xref> and it is straightforwardly computed within an MCMC algorithm.</p><p>We applied the classic random walk Metropolis Hastings algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-Hastings1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-Metropolis1">[22]</xref> and a block-sampling of parameters due to the computationally expensive form of the likelihood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-Gelman1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-Gilks1">[24]</xref>. A log scale has been used for sampling as the parameters were all positive definite and were expected to potentially vary by orders of magnitude. However, linear scale sampling yielded similar results. The convergence of the chains was also very much improved (see Robert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-Robert1">[25]</xref> for more on perfect sampling and reparameterization issues) compared with sampling on a linear scale. The model was coded in C and parallelized using OpenMP 2.0.</p><p>The MCMC sampler was allowed to equilibrate with convergence being evaluated visually from the likelihood and parameter traces. For the simpler models, 5,000 iterations were sufficient for equilibration, while this increased to 20,000 for the most complex models. Also, using log scale sampling, we verified that the chains were able to converge even if started with initial parameter values far from the final posterior mean values. Posterior distributions were estimated from 100,000 iterations. The rate of the acceptance varies from model to model. For the baseline model we achieved a 25% rate of acceptance and for the most complex model (8 parameters), a rate of approx 10%. These values compare well with the “golden” acceptance rate for Random Walk Metropolis Hastings of 23% (Roberts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-Roberts1">[26]</xref>).</p><p>We did not encounter common problems in MCMC estimation like slow convergence and slow mixing (O'Neill <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-ONeill2">[27]</xref>). There were some correlations between parameters, mostly having biological explanations (cattle and sheep infectivity for instance), but a careful parameterization lowers them. We verified parameter estimates were not dependent on parameterization choices – e.g. no difference was seen whether we fitted species infectivity individually, or just fitted sheep infectivity and then the ratio of cattle-to-sheep infectivity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Parameter estimates</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000502-t001">Table 1</xref> lists the parameter estimates we obtained for a set of fitted models conditioned only on the first infection whereas <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000502-t002">Table 2</xref> presents the estimates for models conditioned on infections occurring up to 23<sup>rd</sup> February.

slightly better fit than varying sheep infectivity or both. However, of the models with parameters which vary on 23<sup>rd</sup> February, the model variants which allow the 2 kernel parameters to vary at that time point fit substantially better (by both deviance and DIC criteria, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000502-t001">Table 1</xref>) than those which just allow a species-specific variation in infectivity. This is encouraging for the inference procedure, as the main control measure initiated on that date was the banning of all animal movements – which would be expected to have a major impact on the spatial component of the transmission. We found strong evidence for the kernel decaying much more rapidly with distance after 23<sup>rd</sup> February, with γ<italic><sup>pre</sup></italic> = 1.72 (1.54, 1.93) before 23<sup>rd</sup> February and γ<italic><sup>post</sup></italic> = 2.68 (2.58, 2.78) after that date (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000502-g003">Figure 3a and Figure 3b</xref>). The parameter estimates are less precise before 23<sup>rd</sup> February (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000502-t001">Table 1</xref>) due to the relatively small number of IPs (about 57) before that date.</p><p>Looking at the most complex model (namely the interaction model with time varying kernel), cattle were estimated to be 5.7-fold (4.6, 6.8) more susceptible than sheep (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000502-g003">Figure 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000502-t001">Table 1</xref>). Rather than mentioning animals' specific infectivity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000502-g003">Figure 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000502-t001">Table 1</xref>), it is more informative to comment on the cattle∶sheep infectivity ratio parameter for the most complex fit (this ratio does dot appear in the tables as it is not a model parameter). We calculated it within the MCMC algorithm as the ratio of the two species infectiousness for each sampled parameter point. The most complex model suggests that cattle are 5.95-fold (4.54, 7.63) more infectious than sheep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000502-g003">Figure 3e</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0000502-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000502.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Posterior densities for the estimated parameters from the most complex models conditioned on the first infection allowing for parameter changes on 23<sup>rd</sup> Feb and interaction.</title><p>(a) Spatial kernel powers γ pre and post 23<sup>rd</sup> February.

This is a reasonable assumption for all proactively culled farms except for DCs (which by definition had been identified by veterinarian as having had a high risk of exposure) but our method may underestimate the infection rate.

We found that cattle∶sheep susceptibility ratio is 6.8 (sd 0.44), 95% CI (5.99, 7.72). Cattle and sheep infectivity estimates are 8.44 (sd 0.1) 95%CI (6.68, 10.6) and 1.38 (sd 0.18) 95% CI (1.08, 1.77) respectively (the last two are scaled by a factor of 10<sup>8</sup>). The kernel estimates are 2.58 (sd 0.05) 95%CI (2.49, 2.67) and 1186 (sd 100) 95% (999, 1392) for power and offset, respectively. We learned from this model that pigs are less susceptible than sheep, i.e. pigs∶sheep susceptibility ratio is estimated at 0.27 (sd 0.09) 95%CI (0.14, 0.48). Also, cattle are more infective than pigs by a factor of 1.89 (sd 0.49) 95%CI (1.18, 3.07), but pigs are more infective than sheep by a factor of 3.43 (sd 0.85) 95%CI (1.95, 5.27). A quick comparison with <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000502-t001">Table 1</xref> shows parameter estimates for cattle and sheep are largely unaffected by ignoring the pig population, with none of the estimates from the two analyses being significantly different. We conclude that including pigs would not change the conclusions presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000502-t001">Table 1</xref> regarding cattle and sheep (given the very small number of IPs which had pigs) but it would decrease the power of the analysis and increase model complexity.</p><p>To understand to what extent our estimates are affected by the assumption that the infection dates have been accurately observed, we randomized the estimated infection dates by adding a Gaussian noise with zero mean and a standard deviation of 2 days.

The values are within the 95%CI presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000502-t002">Table 2</xref>. We assessed a sensitivity analysis for the estimated proportion of infections in proactively culled farms (see the previous section) with respect to infection times. Using the predicted parameters for each dataset, we calculated the average proportions across all of them, for each category of proactively culled farms. The average proportion of infections between DC farms is 1.37% (2%, 0.78% and 0.72% for each period of time, respectively). For CP farms, the same quantities evaluate to 1.9% with 1.8%, 1.3% and 1.98%, respectively. Overall proactively culled farms, we obtained an average percentage of 1.25% with 1.64%, 0.81% and 1.6% for each considered period of time.

We tested the sensitivity of parameter estimates to this assumption by examining latent periods of 2 and 3 days. Overall, we would expect infectiousness parameters to increase to compensate for the shorter infectious period, and thus slightly increased generation time (namely the mean time from infection of one case and the time of infection of the cases that case generates). Interestingly, however, it is the kernel parameter estimates which are altered as the latent period is varied with the kernel becoming slightly less local with increasing latent period. For two and three days latent period, pre 23<sup>rd</sup> February, the values of γ dropped from 1.69 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000502-t001">Table 1</xref>) to 1.51 and 1.46 respectively. After this date the same parameter estimate dropped from 2.67 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000502-t001">Table 1</xref>) to 2.64 and 2.59 respectively. This may reflect the fact that increasing the latent period decreases the prevalence and therefore density of infectious farms, thereby increasing the expected mean distance over which infection events occur.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This paper has presented a statistical analysis of the spatiotemporal evolution of the 2001 foot and mouth outbreak in GB. Qualitatively, the results agree with those obtained by Keeling et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-Keeling1">[5]</xref> in identifying cattle as being the key species in the 2001 epidemic. Using the interaction model conditioned on 23<sup>rd</sup> February with time varying cattle infectivity, we estimated that 88% of IPs between 23<sup>rd</sup> Feb–31<sup>st</sup> March were infected by cattle and only 12% by sheep. Sheep-to-sheep transmission only accounts for 3.1% of IPs in that period. After 31<sup>st</sup> March (when we estimated that cattle infectivity increased slightly, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000502-t002">Table 2</xref>) 91% of the IPs were infected by cattle and 8.9% by sheep, with sheep-to-sheep transmission accounting for only 2.3% of infections. While these levels of transmission from sheep farms are even smaller than previously thought <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-Keeling1">[5]</xref>, they are consistent with the results of experimental analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-Streftaris1">[28]</xref> which indicate sheep cannot sustain an epidemic of the Pan O Asian strain of FMD virus.</p><p>Allowing for non-random mixing between species indicates contacts between farms are assortative on the basis of species composition of the farm; i.e. like species mix with like. This agrees with intuition about the nature of farming practices (e.g. sharing of personnel and equipment is likely to be more common if 2 farms have the same livestock species). The implications of the moderate degree of assortativity we found for control measures remains to be explored.</p><p>We did not use data collected during the epidemic on traced contacts between farms to fix the spatial kernel function in our analysis, since in the final version of the FMD epidemic data warehouse [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/footandmouth/cases/index.htm" xlink:type="simple">http://www.defra.gov.uk/footandmouth/cases/index.htm</ext-link>] very few of the contacts apparently identified early in the epidemic remain confirmed. Also we shared the concern of earlier work that the distribution of contact distances in traced contacts may well be biased <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-Ferguson1">[3]</xref>. We therefore estimated the kernel function, using an offset power-law functional form. The higher value of the kernel power parameter we estimated after 23<sup>rd</sup> February (2.67 vs. 1.70 before – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000502-g003">Figure 3a</xref>) is consistent with the expected dramatic shortening in the typical contact distance following the national movement ban. This localized spread together with the higher estimated level of infectivity in cattle after 31<sup>st</sup> March explains the long tail of the epidemic seen in 2001.</p><p>In estimating the transmission risk between farms, we assumed a dependence on the Euclidian distance between them. In reality, other metrics (e.g. the time required to travel between two farms) might be more reasonable, and should be examined in future work. We also did not include information on landscape (e.g. height above sea-level, location of rivers, trees etc).</p><p>The estimated risk maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000502-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000502-g005">Figure 5</xref>) match the areas of the country where highest case incidence rates were seen – with the notable exception of Wales. The discrepancy between the high predicted risk in Wales and the small number of cases observed may reflect inaccuracies in the input data set - Keeling et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-Keeling1">[5]</xref> reduced farm-level sheep population numbers by 30% in Wales and obtained a better geographic match to the data (Matt Keeling, personal communication). However, the discrepancy may also reflect model inadequacy. We have not here allowed for other farm-level risk factors, such as the farm fragmentation index considered by Ferguson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000502-Ferguson1">[3]</xref>. We have not explored more complex non-linear models of the dependence of susceptibility and infectiousness on the number of animals on a farm or relaxed our implicit assumption that contact rates between farms scale linearly with the local density of farms. All these assumptions are being relaxed in ongoing work.</p><p>The most important issue to be revised in future work is to allow for proactively culled farms which were not diagnosed as IPs to be potentially infected and infectious to other farms. This requires modification of the inference model used to allow for an arbitrary number of unobserved infections. The very low numbers of proactively culled farms we estimated as infected suggested that the effect of this model refinement may be limited. It should be noted though that these infection prevalence estimates are in part a result of the relatively non-local kernel estimated simultaneously. If kernel estimates change in a refined analysis – and if DCs were attributed a much higher risk of infection than estimated here due to their status – then it is possible that estimated infection rates in DCs and other proactively culled farms may increase somewhat.</p><p>However, even if these factors increased our estimated infection prevalence among proactively culled farms 5 fold (which seems unlikely from ongoing work), it would still mean that only a small proportion (&lt;10%) of DCs and CPs culled were infected. This does not imply that proactive culling had no effect on the epidemic – as the largest expected effect of such culling is via the targeted depletion of susceptible animals. In this regard, proactive culling has the same epidemiological impact as vaccination. Future work will revisit past estimates of exactly how important such culling was for the control of the 2001 FMD epidemic.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Christl Donnelly for useful discussions.
