        <p>Seagrasses, a unique group of submerged flowering plants, profoundly influence the physical, chemical and biological environments of coastal waters through their high primary productivity and nutrient recycling ability. They provide habitat for aquatic life, alter water flow, stabilize the ground and mitigate the impact of nutrient pollution. at the coast region. Although on a global scale seagrasses represent less than 0.1% of the angiosperm taxa, the taxonomical ambiguity in delineating seagrass species is high. Thus, the taxonomy of several genera is unsolved. While seagrasses are capable of performing both, sexual and asexual reproduction, vegetative reproduction is common and sexual progenies are always short lived and epimeral in nature. This makes species differentiation often difficult, especially for non-taxonomists since the flower as a distinct morphological trait is missing. Our goal is to develop a DNA barcoding system assisting also non-taxonomists to identify regional seagrass species. The results will be corroborated by publicly available sequence data. The main focus is on the 14 described seagrass species of India, supplemented with seagrasses from temperate regions. According to the recommendations of the Consortium for the Barcoding of Life (CBOL) <italic>rbcL</italic> and <italic>matK</italic> were used in this study. After optimization of the DNA extraction method from preserved seagrass material, the respective sequences were amplified from all species analyzed. Tree- and character-based approaches demonstrate that the <italic>rbcL</italic> sequence fragment is capable of resolving up to family and genus level. Only <italic>matK</italic> sequences were reliable in resolving species and partially the ecotype level. Additionally, a plastidic gene spacer was included in the analysis to confirm the identification level. Although the analysis of these three loci solved several nodes, a few complexes remained unsolved, even when constructing a combined tree for all three loci. Our approaches contribute to the understanding of the morphological plasticity of seagrasses versus genetic differentiation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Seagrasses are higher plants capable to complete their life cycle under submerged conditions in the marine environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-denHartog1">[1]</xref>. They evolved independently at least three times between 75 and 17 million years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Bremer1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Kato1">[4]</xref>; hence, seagrasses form a paraphyletic group including four core families (Cymodoceaceae, Hydrocharitaceae, Posidoniaceae, and Zosteraceae). These marine plants cover large geographic ranges worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Les1">[5]</xref>, surviving most diverse environmental conditions. They have fundamental roles in the ecology of coastal areas, e.g. as breeding and nursery ground for a variety of marine organisms, coastal stabilizers or coast protectors next to coral reefs and mangroves. Decline in seagrass species and cover were observed throughout the world and the recent estimates indicate that these resources are gradually disappearing at the rate of 110 km<sup>2</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup> since 1980 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Waycott1">[6]</xref>. Main factors for the loss of seagrasses are eutrophication and high turbidity due to natural and human influences. Furthermore seagrasses contain highly valuable secondary compounds such as phenolic acids used for traditional medicine and biotechnological purposes (e.g. rosmarinic acid as antioxidant or zosteric acid as an effective antifouling agent).</p>
      <p>Due to the similar lifestyle, morphology of seagrasses is reduced and shares a number of similarities e.g. strap-like leaves in case of Posidoniaceae, Cymododoceaceae and Zosteraceae. In addition, seagrasses predominantly propagate by vegetative growth in units, so called ramets. Sexual reproduction occurs rarely due to irregular and seldom flowering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Reusch1">[7]</xref>. Another phenomenon is the ‘trait’ of morphological plasticity within the same species, hypothesized to enable survival in different ecological niches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Bricker1">[8]</xref>. All these factors make correct assignment of species based alone on conventional identification keys difficult or even impossible. For these reasons, closely related species e.g. <italic>Halophila</italic> ssp. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-denHartog2">[9]</xref> still form a taxonomically unresolved complex without correct assignment of species and subspecies. Even molecular phylogenies using <italic>matK</italic>, <italic>rbcL</italic>, and <italic>trnK</italic> and ITS spacer regions yielded in different results resolving the genus complexes. Moreover, only Australian, Southeast Asian and Mediterranean species are included in the molecular databases. At present, no molecular data exist to elucidate Indian seagrass communities.</p>
      <p>The accelerating decrease of seagrass meadows in India and other parts of the world, as well as lack of traditional conservation approaches (e.g. cultivation in botanical gardens) were the main reasons to invest in a seagrass barcoding system.</p>
      <p>DNA barcoding is defined as: Methods for identifying species by using short orthologous DNA sequences, known as “DNA barcodes”, that have been proposed and initiated to facilitate biodiversity studies, identify juveniles, associate sexes, and enhance forensic analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-vonCrutlein1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Kress1">[11]</xref>. The criteria for the development of reliable barcode data was defined by the Consortium for the Barcoding of Life (CBOL) as follows: Candidate loci should be suitable for a wide range of taxa, show a high variation between species, but should be conserved within species, so that the intra-specific variation will be insignificant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Hollingsworth1">[12]</xref>. Ideal barcodes should be routinely retrievable with a single primer pair, be amenable to bidirectional sequencing with little requirement for manual editing of sequence traces and be short enough to ease PCR amplification. Alignment and analysis of the resulting sequences ought to be straightforward, allowing a fast identification without profound prior knowledge about bioinformatics.</p>
      <p>Short standard regions that enable cost-effective species identification are preferable, such as cytochrome C oxidase (COI) for most animal species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-vonCrutlein1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Vijayan1">[13]</xref>. Within 2 h the express barcode system can be successfully recognize and identify certain animal species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Hebert1">[14]</xref>, coming close to the goal of fast and cheap identification. However, so far there is no generally accepted DNA barcode standard for the plant kingdom although a number of recommendations by the CBOL plant working group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Hollingsworth1">[12]</xref> and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Chase1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Shaw2">[20]</xref> exists. The performance of different loci combinations remains insufficient among different plant families <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Roy1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Seberg1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Spooner1">[22]</xref>. Some researchers solved it by designing family specific primers and came closer to accepted phylogeny using this approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Wang1">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Sequences in the plant chondriom evolve too slowly; therefore they cannot be used for discrimination. The nuclear genes contain introns and frequent recombination is observed. Prior knowledge about copy number and linkage groups is needed to perform a neutral analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Pillon1">[24]</xref>. Therefore genes from the plastid genome are the most promising candidate genes for plant DNA barcoding. The plastid genome is uniparentally inherited, non-recombining, and a structurally stable genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Kress1">[11]</xref>. Plastid regions with raw sequence differences ≥2% were categorized as the most variable segments, and therefore the most promising of the plastid genome for DNA barcoding when normalized for length of 300 to 800 bp. Current results indicate that at least two plastid genes, better a multi-locus code, are necessary to specify a reliable plant DNA barcode, one as a “robust and basic” gene like <italic>rbcL</italic> and one a more “variable” like an internal spacer (e.g. <italic>rps16</italic>, <italic>trnH-psbA</italic>) or <italic>matK</italic>. Resulting barcodes of the “robust” gene <italic>rbcL</italic> could be identified using BLAST and resolve to genus and family level, while the “variable” part of the code is for species verification. So far, most promising combinations are <italic>rbcL/matK</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Hollingsworth1">[12]</xref> and <italic>rbcL/psbA-trnH</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Kress1">[11]</xref>. Single-locus barcodes for plants are not advisable, although proposed for <italic>matK</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Fazekas1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Lahaye1">[25]</xref> but clearly lacking the feature of universal amplification. In this approach, we followed the CBOL recommendations and expanded the two-locus system by incorporation of the <italic>trnH-psbA</italic> spacer as a third locus. This spacer region tends to be more variable and might enhance discrimination power of the two-locus system.</p>
      <p>Besides identification of suitable DNA barcoding sequences, reliable searching algorithm and specialized barcode databases are currently missing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Kress3">[26]</xref>. So far, barcoding is relying on methods used in phylogeny although goals are different: (1) fast identification of an operating taxonomic unit, (2) screening of diversity hot spots (3) and no compulsory resolution of relationships across complete families including hybrids and introgression.</p>
      <p>It is well known that tools for tree-based analysis methods have several disadvantages concerning their application on DNA barcoding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Goldstein1">[27]</xref>. Therefore, a character-based method such as the Character Attribute Organization System (CAOS, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-DeSalle1">[28]</xref>) is a promising approach to combine all kinds of data sets goaling at a comprehensive barcoding platform. Additional to these methods, verification of the species using BLAST algorithm based on the data deposited on NCBI was tried. Up to date the CBOL database is only supporting search with <italic>matK</italic> and <italic>rbcL</italic> as barcodes, based on a small dataset which was not supporting seagrasses or related plant families.</p>
      <p>Seagrasses comprise a limited number of species. Several genera are monospecific or show small species representation and their genetic plasticity is limited. Moreover hydrophilic pollination limits the gene flow across the water bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Barrett1">[29]</xref>. On the contrary, recent comparisons of ITS sequences from Chinese and Australian material of <italic>Enhalus</italic>, a monospecific genus, show that they are quite distinct. This warrants the possibility of the existence of additional new species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Waycott1">[6]</xref>. Though different markers were used for different species (<italic>rbcL</italic> and <italic>matK</italic> of the Hydrocharitaceae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Tanaka1">[30]</xref>, nuclear (18SrRNA, ITS) and other cpDNA (<italic>trnL</italic>) loci in <italic>Thalassia</italic>, nuclear (ITS) and cpDNA (<italic>rbcL</italic>, <italic>trnL</italic>) in <italic>Halodule</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Les1">[5]</xref>, chloroplast <italic>trnL</italic> intron and <italic>rbcL</italic> of several seagrasses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Procaccini1">[31]</xref>, nuclear (ITS) and cpDNA (<italic>rbcL</italic>, <italic>trnL</italic>) loci of <italic>Posidonia</italic>, nuclear ITS of <italic>Halophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Waycott2">[32]</xref>, ITS (ITS-1 and ITS-2 regions including the 5.8S rDNA gene), <italic>trnK</italic> introns and <italic>rbcL</italic> of <italic>Zostera</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Les2">[33]</xref>, <italic>rbcL</italic> and <italic>matK</italic> of <italic>Zostera</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Kato1">[4]</xref>, ITS1, 5.8S rDNA and ITS2 of <italic>Halophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Uchimura1">[34]</xref>, and ITS1, 5.8S rDNA and ITS2 of <italic>Halophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Short1">[35]</xref>) there is no generally agreed consensus on conserved molecular region useful for seagrass taxonomy.</p>
      <p>The International Union for Conservation of Nature provides a criterion giving equal importance to conserve both: genetic diversity and ecosystem diversity. Spielman et al. (2004) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Spielman1">[36]</xref> emphasized that most species are not driven to extinction before genetic factors impact them and thus ecological, demographic and genetic processes must be considered together. Therefore a clear understanding of genetic diversity of the seagrass species becomes important by considering the global seagrass decline. But Jones et al. (2008) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Jones1">[37]</xref> alerted that the genetic similarity was highest within each of the seagrass beds indicating a low degree of gene flow from one population to another at different sites and suggested that future restoration and conservation projects should use only local eco-sourced materials rather than using populations of different regions.</p>
      <p>Despite several studies on molecular taxonomy of seagrasses, there is no seagrass sequence in the CBOL database. Therefore, a barcoding system for seagrasses has to be developed based on the experiences with related species. Hence the present study was carried out with the aim to develop a simple but efficient DNA barcoding system for seagrasses, especially for sampling in the tropics. The primer universality for seagrasses was tested. The number of loci for species discrimination and the percentage that can be discriminated was determined by analysing the combination of different loci.</p>

        <p>Several methods including shade-drying, immersion in high NaCl/cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) buffer or freezing in liquid nitrogen were applied to preserve the plant material for DNA extraction. In general, the plants were dug out and cleaned in seawater to remove debris and epiphytes. Clean seagrass leaf samples were directly submerged in CTAB buffer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Storchova1">[38]</xref>. Others were dried overnight at a dry and dark place. The material was grinded to a fine powder at 22 Hz for 2 min using a bead mill (Retsch, Haan, Germany). Then the material was stored at −80°C until analysis. The DNA was extracted from 5 to 10 mg plant material by using the Nucleo Spin Plant Kit II (Machery &amp; Nagel, Düren, Germany) with slight modifications. The first step, incubation time in CTAB buffer, was prolonged to 30 min. The concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (Synergy MX, BioTek Instruments, Bad Friedrichshall, Germany) and analyzed for its intactness by agarose gel electrophoresis.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>After optimization of the DNA extraction method from seagrasses, amplicons for almost all species and primer pairs could be produced in the PCR reactions. Especially for dried herbarium samples the extracted DNA was often degraded and the amplification of large fragments difficult. The recommended primer pairs for the amplification of <italic>rbcL</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Hollingsworth1">[12]</xref> worked well in case of <italic>rbcL</italic> after PCR optimization. For the <italic>matK locus</italic>, another primer pair as recommended by Ford et al. (2009) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Ford1">[39]</xref> lead to successful and reproducible amplification although the primers deviate only slightly. In trials with the CBOL recommended pair reverse-reverse primer 840 bp-fragments were observed in some seagrass species. The best working combination was primer pair 608 and 647 at a wide range of annealing temperatures. The primer universality is summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029987.s005">Table S2</xref>. For the larger fragments - <italic>matK</italic> and <italic>rbcL</italic> - sequence identity was verified by bidirectional sequencing, with less than 0.01% error rates. For the short <italic>trnH-psbA</italic> spacer region bidirectional sequencing was always accurate. Consequently, <italic>trnH-psbA</italic> was only sequenced in one direction for the rest of the analysis.</p>
      <p>Since BLAST can be used as a rapid identification tool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-vonCrutlein1">[10]</xref>, its performance was tested on the seagrass sequences. Over 80% of the taxa used in this study were deposited on NCBI taxonomy. In 62% of all taxa the <italic>rbcL</italic> sequence could be used for direct comparison, but less for <italic>matK</italic> and <italic>trnH-psbA</italic> (37% each). Sequence overlap was generally close to 99%. Only in the case of <italic>H. uninervis</italic> the support was lowered to 86% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029987.s004">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029987.s006">S3</xref>). The BLAST identification level was analyzed for all species, taking the first five BLAST hits into account. Based on this, nearly all species could be identified to genus level. For these with a corresponding sequence often species level was reached.</p>
      <p>The complete sequence sets of <italic>rbcL</italic> and <italic>matK</italic> were analyzed first by tree-based methods focussing on resolution and topology. Exemplary trees obtained by NJ analysis (1,000 Bootstrap replicates) of both sequences were constructed and compared using TreeJuxtaposer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Munzner1">[51]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029987.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The species resolution and topology analysis underlines the need of a two-locus barcode, since species identification was not reliable using a single-locus system. The lines and taxa indicated in red (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029987.s001">Figure S1</xref>) reveal different topologies among the trees indicating that both sequence sets reflect different relationships. The resolution is not satisfying, in particular for the <italic>Halophila</italic> complex and the <italic>Halodule</italic> species. The other algorithms, ML, MP, and Bayesian analysis, used for tree generation resulted in similar conclusions. The DNA barcoding would be of highest benefit to distinguish between the <italic>Halophila</italic> species because of their morphological similarity.</p>
      <p>Testing different combinations of two-loci barcodes revealed higher resolution as well as decreased statistical errors when comparing the different algorithms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029987-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029987-g002">2</xref>). The resolution obtained by distance-based methods like NJ and MP was always higher compared to phylogeny model-based algorithms like Bayesian analysis and ML. In the beginning of the project species resolution obtained by a two-locus barcode was poor, resulting in the need of a third locus. However, during the project the number of sampled taxa was increased and higher number of samples also improved results obtained by the two-locus barcode. Moreover <italic>matK</italic> amplification was also tested on herbarium samples, ranging from 100- to five-year-old material, without any satisfying result. Since shortness and high variability (e.g. <italic>trnH-psbA</italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029987.s002">Figure S2</xref>) are crucial parameters a spacer region was chosen for further analysis. Based on literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Vijayan1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Hollingsworth2">[54]</xref> it was decided to test three spacer fragments from the plastid and the nuclear genome: <italic>trnH-psbA</italic>, <italic>rps16-trnQ</italic> and ITS.

      <p>Gel-based analysis of <italic>trnH-psbA</italic> amplicons showed an optimal result concerning length and its variability. Furthermore this spacer was successfully included in several hot spot barcoding projects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Kress4">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Schreeg1">[56]</xref>. ITS was less variable focused on length, and <italic>rps16-trnQ</italic> resulted in sizes inapplicable for barcoding purposes.</p>
      <p>Since the number of parsimony informative characters (PIC) in a sequence set is one of the basic parameters, the whole dataset and combinations of loci were analyzed for PICs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029987.s002">Figure S2</xref>). As expected from other barcoding studies, <italic>rbcL</italic> showed the highest content of conserved sites, the <italic>trnH-psbA</italic> spacer the lowest and the opposite in the case of variable characters. The percentage of singleton sites was highest in <italic>rbcL</italic> which could be useful in a character-based approach. Combination of the loci revealed an average content of about 24% PIC. The most promising combination, focused on PIC content is <italic>trnH</italic>-<italic>psbA/matK</italic> with 28.4% PIC, while <italic>matK/rbcL</italic> and <italic>rbcL/trnH-psbA</italic> did poorly with only 22% PIC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029987.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
      <p>We expected that a high percentage of PIC and high singleton content would be coupled with a high species discrimination power. Therefore, the percentage of PIC was compared over the species resolution for the different loci and combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029987-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The all-loci combination and <italic>rbcL/matK</italic> were out-performing the single combinations and all other combinations. Although <italic>trnH-psbA</italic> showed the highest variability (&gt;30%), it resulted in lowest discrimination of seagrass species (&lt;60%). Therefore, we analyzed the “barcoding gap” for all loci used. In particular for seagrass species which show a high phenotypic plasticity the continuous discrimination power between species and genus is a parameter of high importance. The frequency of uncorrected intra- and inter-generic <italic>p</italic>-distance was analyzed to visualize the “barcoding gap” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029987-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The data clearly indicated that <italic>trnH</italic>-<italic>psbA</italic> is out-performing with an average inter-generic distance of more than 20%. The intra-generic distance was observed less than 6%, in most cases (47%) even less than 0.5% distance.</p>

      <p>The alignment of the spacer at the 3′ end was almost impossible whereas the 5′ prime end was usable for further analysis. The species resolution did not differ when excluding the 3′ end in the alignment-based analysis of the dataset.

      <p>Since there is no common barcoding and visualization software available, several tree- and character-based approaches were used.

The average branch support was calculated for well resolved clades (above 50%), resulting from all used methods. The average support varied significantly using different methods for single-locus analysis, and increased with the combination of loci.</p>
      <p>The combination of <italic>rbcL/matK</italic> resulted in 100% average branch support, without any ambiguity in MP algorithm. On average the third locus increased the branch support by about 5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029987-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The inclusion of <italic>trnH-psbA</italic> in <italic>rbcL</italic> increased the species resolving power of <italic>rbcL</italic> less than 2% in comparison to <italic>rbcL</italic> alone. By combination of <italic>trnH-psbA</italic> with <italic>matK</italic> the species resolving power of <italic>matK</italic> decreased from 82% to 79%. Here it is evident that <italic>trnH-psbA</italic> when combined with <italic>rbcL</italic> or <italic>matK</italic> lowered the average branch support irrespective of algorithms used for analysis. Although <italic>trnH-psbA</italic> consists of a higher number of PIC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029987.s002">Figure S2</xref>) than any other gene tested, its power in species discrimination is low (&gt;60%). The two-locus combination of <italic>matK/rbcL</italic> provided an average species resolution of 83%, similar to the three-locus combination of <italic>rbcL/trnH-psbA/matK</italic> with an increased efficiency of 86%. All algorithms showed a good average branch support for the combination of all three loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029987-g001">Figure 1</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029987.s001">Figure S1</xref>, single-locus analysis resulted in different topologies for the obtained trees and resolution as well as support, was low compared to a two-locus combination. The exemplary trees obtained from NJ analysis, indicated the low resolution ability of <italic>rbcL</italic>, while the topology of <italic>matK</italic> is not reflecting the accepted phylogenetic view e.g. for <italic>Syringodium</italic>. The impact of the <italic>matK</italic> sequence data can also be tracked by looking at the two-locus <italic>matK/rbcL</italic> combined tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029987-g004">Figure 4</xref>), especially for <italic>Syringodium</italic> and <italic>Halodule</italic> sp. By taking a detailed look, the <italic>matK/rbcL</italic> tree support for all genera is close to 100%. The more complex genera, <italic>Halodule</italic> and <italic>Halophila</italic> are only partly resolved (<italic>H. beccarii</italic>, <italic>H. stipulacea</italic>) and subpopulations are not distinguishable.</p>

      <p>Targeting at a the maximum of informative value in the dataset, it was analyzed for diagnostic characters. Both genes, <italic>matK/rbcL</italic>, were analyzed separately to investigate their usability for character-based barcoding. Furthermore the obtained results were examined for coincidence with the tree-based methods. For <italic>rbcL</italic> the CAOS analysis underlined the results of the tree-based methods (compare <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029987.s001">Figure S1</xref>). For the family and genus level CAs (characteristic attributes) could be found, ranging from 3/599 CAs for <italic>Cymodocea</italic> to 36/599 CAs for <italic>Halodule</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029987.s007">Table S4</xref>).</p>
      <p>In the <italic>Halophila</italic> complex, only for <italic>H. beccarii</italic> and <italic>H. stipulacea</italic> CAs could be found. The remaining <italic>Halophila</italic> species did not show any difference in their sequence, consequently no CAs were found. The same was true for <italic>Halodule</italic> were no CAs between <italic>H. pinifolia</italic>, <italic>H. uninervis</italic> and <italic>H. wrightii</italic> have been detected. Genetic unique characters were only found for the unknown <italic>Halodule</italic> species in a surprisingly high amount (25/599). In case of the remaining species diagnostic CAs were found as presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029987.s007">Table S4</xref>.</p>
      <p>CAs for the families and genera were detected by looking at <italic>matK</italic>,. For most species characteristic attributes could be found which underlines its variability.For the <italic>Halophila</italic> complex, still two blocks remain, bearing the same sequences: (1) <italic>H. ovata</italic>, <italic>H. ovalis</italic>* and <italic>H.</italic> sp. B, (2) <italic>H. ovalis</italic> and <italic>H. decipiens</italic>. For <italic>H. beccarii</italic> (18/845) sites could be found whereas only (3/845) CAs in <italic>H. stipulacea</italic> were observed. This approach also identified <italic>H.</italic> sp. A as <italic>H. beccarii</italic>. Interestingly, for the subspecies of <italic>H. ovalis</italic> (5/845) CAs were observed. In case of the <italic>Halodule</italic> complex, complete similarity was only detected for <italic>H. uninervis</italic> and <italic>H. pinifolia</italic> from Palk Bay, whereas <italic>Halodule</italic> species from the Chilika lagoon appear to have unique attributes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029987.s008">Table S5</xref>).</p>
      <p>The final combined tree resolved three distinct clades of seagrasses: Hydrocharitaceae, Zosteraceae and Cymodoceaceae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029987-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The missing family Posidoniaceae is arranged in order to the Cymodoceaceae family in pre-analysis trees (data not shown). The support values of the different nodes are taken from the full-dataset analysis. The results highlight that Bayesian and ML analysis performed mostly similar and less critical than NJ and MP.</p>

      <p>The described small genera like <italic>Syringodium</italic>, <italic>Enhalus</italic> and <italic>Thalassia</italic> are well supported and the implied species could be clearly resolved and identified (support ranging from 79 to 100%). The resolution of the complex genera does not improve in comparison to the combination of <italic>rbcL/matK</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029987-g004">Figure 4</xref>). A stringent dichotomic tree could not be achieved with the tree-based methods.</p>
      <p>For the <italic>Halophila</italic> genus, two unidentified species from the Chilika Lagoon were incorporated into the analysis. The identification based on minor morphological characters is challenging since single leaf-paired <italic>Halophila</italic> species show a high phenotypic plasticity. While <italic>H. beccarii</italic> and <italic>H. stipulacea</italic> form distinct clades, the other <italic>Halophila</italic> species remain as a complex using <italic>matK/rbcL</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029987-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Here one unidentified species could be assigned as <italic>H. beccarii</italic> with strong support. Congruent to the two-locus combination, also in the three-locus combination three distinct clades can be found in the inner Halophila complex: (1) <italic>H. ovata</italic> grouped with <italic>H. ovalis</italic> from the Chilika lagoon and the other unknown species; (2) <italic>Halophila ovalis</italic> subsp. <italic>ramamurthiana</italic> and (3) <italic>H. decipiens</italic> and <italic>H. ovalis</italic> from Palk Bay. These three groups are congruent with the findings of the character-based identification approach using <italic>matK</italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029987.s008">Table S5</xref>). Consequently, the likelihood of wrong morphological-based assignment can be taken into account.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Recent research indicates seagrasses as a potential alternate source for isolation and extraction of secondary metabolites of high value in medicine and biotechnological applications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Newby1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Achamlale1">[59]</xref>. Our research aim is to identify and exploit the secondary compounds from seagrasses. For this purpose seagrasses need to be cultured or the valuable compounds need to be synthesized chemically. Based on discussion with Indian scientists, literature studies and on-site visits of Indian seagrass beds, the need for a genetic classification of the investigated species became obvious. At times, separation of different seagrass species becomes challenging, even for a seagrass taxonomist. However, there was the need for a fast, reliable, and cost-efficient system for recognition and identification of seagrasses also by non-experts. In addition there were a number of questions by local ecologists concerning the composition of the seagrass mats including some unassigned species which had not been found before at the specific sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Ghosh1">[60]</xref>. These kinds of questions can be answered using a technically simple DNA barcoding system.</p>
      <p>To establish a DNA barcoding system for seagrasses the recommendations by Hollingsworth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Hollingsworth1">[12]</xref> for plant species in general were followed using a two-locus approach with specific primers for the amplification of <italic>rbcL</italic> and <italic>matK</italic>. To the best of our knowledge there are no seagrass barcode data available in the CBOL database at present.</p>
      <p>Seagrasses expand their meadows by vegetative propagation through rhizomes. Over time individuals can therefore spread over wide areas. Collection of homogeneous seagrass samples is hampered because different genotypes grow in direct vicinity forming vast networks. This was observed for well accessible seagrass locations (e.g. <italic>Z. marina</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Procaccini1">[31]</xref>) populations. Such networks are often multi-specific, comprised of up to 12 species in complex seagrass beds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Duarte1">[61]</xref> and/or contain different individuals of the same plant species. In addition a voucher specimen should be directly collected and dried to conserve this individual plant also for future references. However, as several people were involved in the collection process, specimen collection of voucher plant individuals could not be ensured. The access to some of the sampling sites was difficult and divers were not always able to follow well-known collection rules. Focus during collection goaled more on finding and identification, than on correct sampling. For the identification of genotypes and their role in the ecosystem the sampling strategy has to be improved and probably one has to concentrate on a small number of species with facile access.</p>
      <p>Seagrasses contain a number of different phenolic compounds which make them attractive from a biotechnological point of view, but difficult to handle for genetic analysis from dried material. Several DNA extraction methods have been tested and only a few lead to a DNA quality which could be used for PCR amplifications. Also the PCR conditions have been optimized and several additives were tested to obtain reproducible amplification results. Still the amplification of larger fragments, such as the <italic>matK</italic> fragment of more than 800 bp caused difficulties.</p>
      <p>The recommended two-locus DNA barcode consisting of <italic>matK</italic> and <italic>rbcL</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Hollingsworth1">[12]</xref> was suggested to be the best compromise in comparison to all other loci tested. The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029987-g004">Figure 4</xref>) indicate that two plastid genes are not sufficient to fully resolve seagrasses at the species level. For most projects, a discrimination power of 70% is sufficient, but for higher resolution of complex species, the use of additional loci was supposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Hollingsworth2">[54]</xref>.</p>
      <p>For this project the discrimination power needed to be at a high level so that subspecies level differences can be resolved. This is important for some seagrasses genera where several subspecies and even ecotypes are encountered. Therefore the more variable plastid spacer was included into the analysis. This three-locus combination was successfully used in barcoding tropic plants at diversity hot spots <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Kress4">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Schreeg1">[56]</xref>. The <italic>trnH-psbA</italic> spacer, on average about 450 bp, is varying from 296 to 1120 bp based on available data, is one of the most variable plastid regions in angiosperms and is easily amplified across a broad range of land plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Vijayan1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Kress2">[17]</xref>. For seagrass species the universality of <italic>matK</italic> and <italic>rbcL</italic> primers is high. After optimization, PCR, cloning and sequencing was straight-forward for all three barcodes used. As expected combined loci analyses dramatically improved the average branch support at different combinations compared to the single-locus analysis. This underlines that single-locus analysis of closely related species does not result in a robust system as already proposed for <italic>matK</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Lahaye1">[25]</xref>. For the two-locus combinations, <italic>rbcL/matK</italic> performed best, while the combinations with <italic>trnH-psbA</italic> where significantly lower in support than in single locus performance. A high value of PICs is not connected with a high discrimination power, at least for sea grass species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029987-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The advantage of a three-locus combination is the reproducibility using different algorithms for analysis. Setting the focus on simple and cost effective identification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Hollingsworth2">[54]</xref> the two-locus combination <italic>matK/rbcL</italic> is adequate as was also demonstrated by the character-based approach. Furthermore the data processing of <italic>trnH-psbA</italic> is not straightforward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Whitlock1">[52]</xref>, decreasing the chance for plant barcoding to catch up with fast systems already used for the animal kingdom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Ivanova1">[62]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Vijayan and Tsou (2010) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Vijayan1">[13]</xref> suggested that until more useful barcodes are identified, the presently proposed DNA barcodes (<italic>rbcL/matK</italic>) can be used to initiate barcoding of all land and water plants, with some family exceptions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Roy1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Seberg1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Spooner1">[22]</xref>. This tendency is supported by in our analysis using BLAST as simple and fast identification tool (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029987.s006">Table S3</xref>). The <italic>matK</italic> and <italic>rbcL</italic> sequences which are already contained in the database provide a good basis for identification at least to the genus level with a database providing comparable data for nearly 70% of the considered seagrass taxa. Since not all species are deposited in publicly available databases, especially questionable subspecies, the combined tree construction is based on the three-locus barcodes. This approach ensures the identification and classification of unknown species (e.g. from the Chilika Lagoon) and <italic>Halophila</italic> subsp. by a trustable average branch support for the different tree constructions methods used. From the consensus tree all genera are separated into clear clades, especially genera with single species (e.g. <italic>Enhalus</italic> or <italic>Thalassia</italic>). For the Zosteraceae, the distance-based methods like MP and NJ could also distinguish subpopulations (e.g. of <italic>Zostera marina</italic>). Still, uncertainties persist with the more complex genera like <italic>Halodule</italic> and <italic>Halophila</italic>. In case of <italic>H. uninervis</italic> the populations of the Chilika lagoon and Palk Bay were distantly out-grouped, while <italic>H. pinifolia</italic> from both areas is grouped together. This is reflecting the confusion and ambiguous status of the taxonomy between these two species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Waycott3">[63]</xref>, although Ito &amp; Tanaka (2011) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Ito1">[64]</xref> obtained a clear taxonomy for Asian <italic>Halodule</italic> populations. <italic>H. wrightii</italic> appears to be genetically unique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Waycott3">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Angel1">[65]</xref>, although it is morphologically distinguished only through the form of the leaf tip <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-denHartog1">[1]</xref>, like <italic>H. pinifolia</italic> and <italic>H. uninervis</italic>.</p>
      <p>The character-based barcoding presents a method for unambiguous identification based on analysis of unique sequence sites. This approach is not restricted to DNA-based barcoding applications, nearly every kind of data can be used. For the seagrass dataset no new findings could be elucidated with this approach, but conjectural relations could be verified. The role of <italic>rbcL</italic> as a basic, conservative marker fragment could be underlined as CAs where only found on genus level. The percentage of species identification was similarly low compared to tree-based methods. <italic>MatK</italic> provided much more CAs, archiving the same percentage of species identification as with a tree-based approach. The character-based barcoding indicates additionally the misidentification of <italic>H. decipiens</italic> at Palk Bay and <italic>H. ovalis</italic> at Chilika Lagoon. This misidentification can be considered with high likelihood as it is in congruence with the tree-based approach. Furthermore, the <italic>Halodule</italic> species found at the Lagoon can be verified as genetically different to species found in the open sea. Clear advantage of the character-based system is its correctness, but nevertheless profound bioinformatic knowledge is needed, as the software is based on a compulsory dichotomic tree and a very accurate alignment. Here the identification using BLAST is still the simplest approach.</p>
      <p>It is important to understand genetic differences and population structure to sustain current level genetic diversity within the <italic>Halodule</italic> species. Based on this point the plants collected at Chilika Lagoon could represent a species or subspecies of <italic>Halodule</italic> as it was out-grouped separately from all three <italic>Halodule</italic> species of India. One cannot refuse the probable genetic mix-up among the species. Our data indicate this possibility especially in case of <italic>H. pinifolia</italic> and <italic>H. uninervis</italic>. Furthermore, the hit number for <italic>rbcL</italic> was ambiguous for <italic>H. uninervis</italic> as well as <italic>H. pinifolia</italic> while performing the BLAST identification approach. This indicates that more detailed genetic studies among the different populations of <italic>Halodule</italic> in India are needed, similar to the approach of Ito &amp; Tanaka (2011) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Ito1">[64]</xref> for Asian <italic>Halodule</italic> populations.</p>
      <p>In case of the <italic>Halophila</italic> genus the position of <italic>H. decipiens</italic> is not correct. In previous studies <italic>H. decipiens</italic> was found on the base of the <italic>Halophila</italic> clade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Waycott2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Uchimura1">[34]</xref>, indicating a potential genetic mix-up between indo-pacific species, possibly by cross breeding. This is supported by its worldwide distribution, where no sequence differences occur between samples from the Caribbean and from around the Indo-Pacific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Waycott3">[63]</xref>. <italic>H. ovalis</italic> and <italic>H. ovata</italic> could be differentiated only with leaf lamina and number of leaf veins, but confusions persist in identification of juveniles. Comparison to previous sequencing results could be only tested using <italic>rbcL</italic>, showing a high overlap (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029987.s006">Table S3</xref>).</p>
      <p>In case of the simple thallus-like <italic>Halophila</italic> species, the <italic>rbcL</italic> sequence characters are as similar as their morphological characters and do not provide an informative content for barcoding (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029987.s007">Table S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029987.s008">S5</xref>). In particular, misidentifications in the <italic>Halophila</italic> genus could be elucidated with the presented barcoding approach, though this could not be achieved for <italic>Halodule</italic>. DNA barcoding is wrongly addressed to this taxonomically problematic genus. The presented barcoding system verifies that these two genera are challenging for identification. So for establishing a correct seagrass barcoding database, close ups like microsatellites should be used, as recently published for <italic>H. beccarii</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Jiang1">[66]</xref> rather than misleading, environmentally influenced morphological characters.</p>
      <p>This could uncover whether a genetic mix-up occurred or phenotypic plasticity is an underestimated trait for seagrasses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Bricker1">[8]</xref>, helping them to survive in different niches like deep water, deepwater with light limitation, intertidal areas, shallow turbid waters, eutrophic waters etc. where they are capable of adapting to overcome the local conditions. Only more detailed loci may solve the complex taxonomy and cleanup questionable assignments for species which share nearly all morphological identities like <italic>H. ovata</italic>, <italic>H. gaudichaudii</italic> and <italic>H. okinawensis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Uchimura1">[34]</xref>. To summarize the results of the different trees, it is obvious that a single locus is not able to resolve well-described species properly (<italic>rbcL</italic>, <italic>trnH-psbA</italic>) or the marker is not robust using only a few specimens (<italic>matK</italic>). Hence, one gets a result not fitting to the well-known phylogeny of Alismatales.</p>
      <p>A rapid system for identification close to species level is provided by using <italic>matK</italic> and <italic>rbcL</italic>. The spacer region <italic>trnH-psbA</italic> cannot be recommended for barcoding purposes at least for the ecological group of seagrasses. The fact of a clearly existing “barcoding gap” makes it not suitable for barcoding seagrass, not providing more information than e.g. <italic>rbcL</italic> or <italic>matK</italic>. Including the structure of internal spacers could be a promising approach for phylogenetic analysis. ITS or <italic>phyC</italic> could serve as additional supplemental loci and were used successfully in several other phylogenetic analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Les2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Uchimura1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Waycott3">[63]</xref>. One should be aware that barcoding is not a replacement for phylogenetic analysis and maybe the remaining complexes of <italic>Halodule</italic> and <italic>Halophila</italic> are a more taxonomic and systematic problem and it is wrongly addressed by a simple method like DNA barcoding. The complex formations of <italic>Halodule</italic> and <italic>Halophila</italic> need to be more carefully analyzed as they show more phenotypic plasticity and are known to be problematic concerning species discrimination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Waycott1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Uchimura1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Ito1">[64]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In summary, recognition of seagrasses by DNA barcoding is possible and feasible. Two unknown species from the Chilika Lagoon could successfully be identified (<italic>H. beccarii and H. ovata</italic>) and were verified on the congruence of tree- and character-based analysis. Misidentifications can be unambiguously defined as the bottleneck for establishing a solid database for DNA-based identification of seagrass. Furthermore these misidentifications, e.g. <italic>H. ovalis</italic> from the Chilika Lagoon or <italic>H. decipiens</italic> from Palk Bay, could be revealed by the developed system. The known complex of <italic>Halodule</italic> remained, unfortunately, unresolved. This indicates, as discussed above, the demand for a more detailed study including worldwide populations and the choice of a high resolution marker system (e.g. microsatellites) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029987-Jiang1">[66]</xref>. Our recommendation is to use the <italic>matK/rbcL</italic> combination as a cost effective and straight forward method. The attained identification level is good enough for ecological survey and conservation purposes, as meadows constantly decrease in area and species diversity.</p>

      <p>We would like to thank Dr. A. Pattnaik, Chilika Development Authority, Bubaneshwar, Orissa, India, for his hospitality and constant encouragement. We obtained herbarium material of seagrasses from Dr. Klaus Pistrick, Institute of plant genetics and crop plants, Gatersleben, Germany. Members of the Waddensee station, Sylt, belonging to the Alfred-Wegener Institute, are gratefully acknowledged for help in the field. Tjard Bergmann, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, helped to use the CAOS approach in a meaningful way. We are grateful to Sascha Offermann, Hannover, who corrected the English language.</p>
      <p>The sequence data were deposited at GenBank. The accession numbers are summarized (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029987.s004">Table S1</xref>).</p>
