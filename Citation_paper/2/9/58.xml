<abstract>
<p>Saline lakes are intriguing ecosystems harboring extremely productive microbial communities in spite of their extreme environmental conditions. We performed a comprehensive analysis of the genetic diversity (18S rRNA gene) of the planktonic microbial eukaryotes (nano- and picoeukaryotes) in six different inland saline lakes located in the Qaidam Basin. The novelty level are high, with about 11.23% of the whole dataset showing &lt;90% identity to any previously reported sequence in GenBank. At least 4 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in mesosaline lakes, while up to eighteen OTUs in hypersaline lakes show very low CCM and CEM scores, indicating that these sequences are highly distantly related to any existing sequence. Most of the 18S rRNA gene sequence reads obtained in investigated mesosaline lakes is closely related to Holozoa group (48.13%), whereas Stramenopiles (26.65%) and Alveolates (10.84%) are the next most common groups. Hypersaline lakes in the Qaidam Basin are also dominated by Holozoa group, accounting for 26.65% of the total number of sequence reads. Notably, Chlorophyta group are only found in high abundance in Lake Gasikule (28.00%), whereas less represented in other hypersaline lakes such as Gahai (0.50%) and Xiaochaidan (1.15%). Further analysis show that the compositions of planktonic eukaryotic assemblages are also most variable between different sampling sites in the same lake. Out of the parameters, four show significant correlation to this CCA: altitude, calcium, sodium and potassium concentrations. Overall, this study shows important gaps in the current knowledge about planktonic microbial eukaryotes inhabiting Qaidam Basin (hyper) saline water bodies. The identified diversity and novelty patterns among eukaryotic plankton assemblages in saline lake are of great importance for understanding and interpreting their ecology and evolution.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Saline lakes usually occur in endorheic drainage basins, which span approximately 1/10 of the Earth's surface area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Waiser1">[1]</xref>. Inland saline lakes represent approximately 5% of modern drylands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Bryant1">[2]</xref>; these lakes are numerous and are distributed worldwide in semi-arid or arid areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Williams1">[3]</xref>. Inland saline lakes and freshwater lakes from humid areas account for similar proportions of global water, approximately 0.008% and 0.009%, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-RamsarConvention1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Casamayor1">[5]</xref>. Saline lakes are important reservoirs of largely unseen microbial biodiversity with high phylogenetic richness and novelty <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Casamayor1">[5]</xref>. Saline lakes at high altitudes are also productive and represent an important and extreme ecosystem harboring many novel prokaryotic microorganisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Massana1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Wu1">[7]</xref>. Small-sized planktonic microorganisms are critical for aquatic systems, mostly as major contributors to production and biomass and as key players driving carbon and nutrient cycles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Caron1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Logares1">[9]</xref>. The genetic diversity of microbial communities in saline lakes has been studied in different areas of the world, including the USA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Dillon1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Parnell1">[11]</xref>, Mongolia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Pagaling1">[12]</xref>, China <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Wu1">[7]</xref>, Iran <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-MakhdoumiKakhki1">[13]</xref>, Australia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Narasingarao1">[14]</xref>, Spain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Casamayor1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-TriadMargarit1">[15]</xref>, and the Andean Altiplano <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Demergasso1">[16]</xref>. However, our current knowledge on microorganisms isolated in culture does not completely represent the microbial diversity in saline systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Casamayor1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Wu1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-TriadMargarit1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Oren1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>Salinity is an important factor that selects and structures microbial assemblages globally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Lozupone1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Barbern1">[20]</xref>, and microorganisms inhabiting high salinity environments, mostly prokaryotes, have developed several salinity-stress adaptation strategies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Oren2">[21]</xref>. Eukaryotes might have greater difficulty in coping with the selective effect of high salinity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Oren2">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-PedrsAli1">[22]</xref>, resulting in large decreases in the number of species as salinity increases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Hauer1">[23]</xref>. This hypothesis might explain why eukaryotes are poorly represented in high-salinity environments compared to prokaryotes. Description of the molecular diversity of small marine eukaryotes through rRNA gene cloning and sequencing has revealed a large diversity of ribosomal types and identified novel lineages within microbial eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Massana2">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Wolf1">[25]</xref>. However, there are few studies analyzing the genetic diversity of eukaryotic assemblages in high-salt environments at high altitudes, although consistent changes in eukaryotic community composition and richness have been observed along salinity gradients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Casamayor2">[26]</xref>. Sequence analysis of selected major denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) bands revealed many sequences (largely protist) that are not related to any known cultures but that are related to uncultured eukaryotic picoplankton and unidentified eukaryotes in Eastern Tibetan Lakes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Wu1">[7]</xref>. High-salinity water bodies in inland saline ponds contain an unexpected large genetic diversity of novel protists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-TriadMargarit1">[15]</xref>, but the number of such eukaryotic microbial species in these environments remains to be elucidated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Casamayor1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Lanzen1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>Traditionally, studies on the diversity of eukaryotic assemblages (protist) have largely relied on morphological surveys using different microscopic techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Beaver1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Eiler1">[30]</xref>, and some important components of the microbial diversity in environmental samples have remained undetected using traditional methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Casamayor1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-TriadMargarit1">[15]</xref>. Microscopy approaches have difficulties in identifying small cells (&lt;10 µm), and thus, this fraction is understudied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Wolf1">[25]</xref>. Recently, the development of high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology for DNA sequencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Casamayor1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Lanzen1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Eiler1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Hadziavdic1">[33]</xref> has facilitated extensive sequence-based characterization of diverse natural microbial communities and has allowed an assessment of microbial communities at high resolution based on deep taxon sampling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Kilias1">[34]</xref>. Because millions of sequence reads are generated in a single experiment, NGS has revolutionized surveys of microbial diversity. Compared to microscopy, NGS-based amplicon sequencing is superior in detecting rare species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Medinger1">[35]</xref>, and it is now possible to recognize and identify nano- and picophytoplankton such as unicellular cyanobacteria and small flagellates, which cannot be discriminated based on morphological features <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Wolf1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Lanzen1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Eiler1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Hadziavdic1">[33]</xref>.</p>
<p>The 18S rRNA gene is a widely used and valuable ‘bar-code’ to analyze eukaryotic diversity, because it is universally present in living organisms, and there are significant sequence data for comparison in public databases such as GenBank <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Eiler1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Hadziavdic1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Ebenezer1">[36]</xref>. Recently, this gene marker is commonly used for the next-generation sequencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Wolf1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Cheung1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Stoeck1">[42]</xref>. The repetitive arrangement of rRNA genes within the genome provides large amounts of template DNA for PCR, even in the smallest organisms. Comparative studies using 18S rRNAs have observed that the major length-variable regions are distributed on the surface of the molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Spahn1">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Chandramouli1">[45]</xref>, whereas the intronic splicing sites are clustered in the inner region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Chandramouli1">[45]</xref>. However, some sources of bias have been identified, including pyrosequencing errors [46–47], inappropriate clustering approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Kunin1">[48]</xref> or inconsistent results from different targeted 18S rDNA regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Stoeck1">[42]</xref>. More recently, Hadziavdic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Hadziavdic1">[33]</xref> et al. (2014) completely characterized the variable and conserved regions in the 18S rRNA gene, and their results suggested that the V2, V4, and V9 regions are best suited for biodiversity analysis. Furthermore, algorithms to remove pyrosequencing errors have been developed to reduce these overestimations, such as single-linkage preclustering (SLP) approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Kunin1">[48]</xref>. The 18S rDNA amplicon pyrosequencing has become a widespread approach for microbial community diversity studies. However, to the best of our knowledge, no similar studies have been performed on eukaryotic plankton in high-salt environments at high altitudes.</p>
<p>The Qaidam Basin is located in the northeastern section of the Plateau of Tibet, occupying the northwestern part of Qinghai province, western China. The basin is almost entirely an area of interior drainage, with rivers discharging either into Koko Nor or into one of the numerous salt lakes and saline swamps in the basin’s central area, such as Tuosu, Dasugan, Gahai, Gasikule and Xiaochaidan. In the present work, we have analyzed the genetic diversity of planktonic microbial eukaryotes (size range 0.2–20 µm) along a salinity gradient in six water bodies in the Qaidam Basin using next generation sequencing (NGS). Samples were obtained from different geographic regions and covered a wide range of environmental conditions such as salinity (concentration and composition), in situ temperatures, trophic status, water and connectivity regimes, and altitude, which captured part of the high variety of saline habitats present in continental areas.</p>

<p>No specific permissions are required for six lakes, located in publicly accessible areas. The field studies did not involve endangered or protected species. Overall, 13 samples (Lake Keluke 1, Lake Keluke 2, Lake Dasugan 10, Lake Dasugan 11, Lake Tuosu 3, Lake Tuosu 11, Lake Tuosu 12, Xiaochaidan 12, Xiaochaidan 13, Lake Gahai 1, Lake Gahai 7, Lake Gsikule 1 and Lake Gsikule 3, hereafter referred to as K11, K13, D10, D11, T3, T11, T12, M1, M7, X12, X13, G1, G3, respectively) were analyzed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0112812-t001">Table 1</xref>). Six lakes located on the Qaidam Basin at altitudes ranging from 2,792 to 3,170 m above sea level were investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112812-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The lakes were chosen in order to cover a salinity gradient from 0 to 466 g/L. Water samples were collected from surface waters (top 30 cm) with a 5 L schindler sampler in August 2013 and were first condensed by 0.2-µm pore-size filters. Plankton samples (2000–2500 ml water) for NGS analyses were further filtered through a 20 µm mesh sieve immediately to remove most of the large particles. Water temperatures, pH and dissolved oxygen levels were measured on board using a Hydrolab sensor (Austin, TX, USA). Concentrations of the six major ions potassium (K<sup>+</sup>), sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>), calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>), chloride (Cl<sup>−</sup>), and sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>), as well as the concentration of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were measured according to the standard methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Casamayor1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Wu1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Huse2">[49]</xref> after transportation of samples to the laboratory. The total dissolved solid (TDS) of the investigated habitats was determined by a conventional conductivity meter (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0112812-t001">Table 1</xref>). Filters for extraction of DNA were centrifuged to the bottom of the eppendorf tube (3200 g 5 min, Eppendorf 5810R) and stored at −80°C in an ultra low-temperature freezer for DNA extraction. DNA was extracted after the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide extraction procedure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Wu1">[7]</xref>. The final ethanol-rinsed DNA pellets were dried and resuspended in 100 µL of 1× TE buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl, 1 mM EDTA) and stored at −80°C. DNA concentration and quality were determined with a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Wilmington, DE, USA).</p>

<title>Analysis of 454 pyrosequencing data and clustering of sequence reads into OTUs</title>
<p>The 454 sequencing reads were processed using the Qiime (Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology, v1.3.0) pipeline as flowgrams (.sff files). The data was processed following the steps recommended in the Qiime processing 18S data tutorial. In order to increase the quality of the raw sequences, reads shorter than 300 bp were excluded from the analysis to guarantee the analysis of the whole V4 region. Sequences longer than 670 bp (expected amplicon size) and those with more than one uncertain base (N) were further removed. The following parameters settings were used, namely an operational taxonomic unit (OTU) threshold of 0.97, 2 as maximum number of primer mismatches, 0 ambiguous bases, a maximum length of homopolymer run of 10, 300 nucleotides as a minimum sequence length and 670 as a maximum sequence length. The multiplexed reads were assigned to samples based on their nucleotide barcode. The data were then de-noised using the de-noiser wrapper within Qiime to remove the sequence errors characteristic of 454 sequencing machines. Chimeras were identified using ChimeraSlayer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Greenberg1">[50]</xref> and rejected from the dataset before construction of the OTU table. The OTUs were assigned using UCLUST <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Haas1">[51]</xref>, an open reference OTU picker within Qiime, a representative set of sequences was then generated and these sequences were assigned taxonomy using the SILVA release 115 database.</p>
<p>Another clustering process was to apply the NDIST module of AmpliconNoise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Edgar1">[52]</xref> with default parameters to generate the distance matrix of all Needleman–Wunsch pairwise sequence alignments. Then, the average linkage option in the AmpliconNoise FCluster module was used to cluster reads into OTUs. In addition, we ran CD-HIT-OTU, a recent clustering algorithm for 18S rDNA pyrosequence data, with default parameters (including –e 0.0025) on the OTU finder web server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://weizhong-lab.ucsd.edu/metagenomic-analysis/server/cd-hit-otu/" xlink:type="simple">http://weizhong-lab.ucsd.edu/metagenomic-analysis/server/cd-hit-otu/</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Characteristics of the studied lakes</title>
<p>The surveyed systems covered a wide range of variability in environmental conditions, including up to 40-fold differences in the salinity gradient (from 0 to approximately 46% salinity), altitude (from 2792 m to 3170 m), and in situ temperature (from 10.8 to 19.3°C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112812-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0112812-t001">Table 1</xref>). The Gahai, Gasikule, and Xiaochaidan lakes are more saline (hypersaline lakes &gt;50 g/L) compared to the lakes Tuosu and Dasugan (mesosaline lakes, 20–50 g/L). The Lake Keluke is the only freshwater lake in this study. These six lakes are located in four different regions, with a minimum distance of 5 kilometers between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112812-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Lake Gasikule is located in the northwestern part of the Qaidam Basin, where less precipitation and high evaporation have resulted in the highest salinity. Lake Dasugan, in which the ground water is considered the primary source of runoff, is located in the northern part of the Qaidam Basin. Lake Xiaochaidan is located in the northeastern part of the Qaidam Basin, whereas the other three lakes are located in close proximity to each other in the eastern part of the Qaidam Basin and have significantly different physical and chemical conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0112812-t001">Table 1</xref>). Over the last century, Lake Xiaochaidan has been completely drained to exploit mineral resources and has been recovered by the reinjection of water. Lake Tuosu is connected to the freshwater lake Keluke by a short river; Lake Tuosu is expanding, resulting in altered salinities and phytoplankton communities. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0112812-t001">Table 1</xref> lists the sampling sites, collected samples and physicochemical parameters that were measured. PCA of the lake environmental factors revealed that the first two components accounted for 79.44% of the total variation (PC1, 63.48%; PC2, 15.96%). There was a significant salinity gradient among the lakes, as observed by the high correlation between PCA axis 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112812-g002">Figure 2</xref>) and the chemical parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112812.s003">Table S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Composition of the eukaryotic (nano- and picoeukaryotes) plankton community in saline lake</title>
<p>After quality filtering and preprocessing, 350 640 reads were obtained from the 13 sequenced samples in the study; approximately eighty-one percent, or a total of 286 360 reads, could be assigned to eukaryotic assemblages. Sequencing yielded highly variable results among the samples, ranging from 15 482 to 30 625 total reads per sample. A ML phylogenetic tree with all sequence reads provided a detailed picture of the diversity of Qaidam Basin lake eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112812-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). To our surprise, at least 11.23% in total number of sequence reads could not be precisely assigned to any known eukaryotic taxonomic group. Further analysis showed that the 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequence were distributed among thirteen high-rank taxonomic groups and matched 70 eukaryal classes in freshwater lake (indigo in the outer ring) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112812-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112812.s004">Table S2</xref>).

Most sequence reads from freshwater lake were affiliated with class Intramacronucleata (Alveolata), accounting for 29.50% of the total number of sequence reads. Eukaryotes from mesosaline lakes (lime in the outer ring) were distributed among eleven high-rank taxonomic groups and 38 eukaryal classes, whereas at least 16 classes could not be clearly attributed to known eukaryotic taxonomic groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112812-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112812.s004">Table S2</xref>). Craspedida (Holozoa) were the most prevalent class in mesosaline lakes, accounting for 26.52% of all sequence reads. The 18S rRNA gene sequences obtained from hypersaline lakes (seagreen in the outer ring) were distributed among eleven high-ranking taxonomic groups and matched 53 classes. The most prevalent class in hypersaline lakes was affiliated with Animalia (Holozoa), accounting for 21.98% of the total number of sequence reads. Notably, as was shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112812.s004">Table S2</xref>, at least 35.85% of the total numbers of classes likely represented novel phylogenetic lineages at the class level.</p>

<p>There were approximately 14.85%, 2.85%, and 29.85% sequence reads defined as unclassified eukaryal clusters in the hypersaline lakes Xiaochaidan, Gasikule, and Gahai, respectively. Most sequences from Lake Xiaochaidan were affiliated with Stramenopiles (34.10%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112812-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Haptophyta are the next most prevalent kingdom in Lake Xiaochaidan, accounting for 31.60% of all sequence reads. However, the most abundant sequence reads were mainly represented by Holozoa (36.35%), Chloroplastida (28.00%), Alveolata (17.25%), and Stramenopiles (10.20%) in Lake Gasikule. Holozoa is also the most common kingdom in Lake Gahai, accounting for 30.15% of the total number of sequence reads.

<title>Most abundant taxa in different sampling sites</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112812-g005">Figure 5</xref>, an <italic>uncultured_freshwater cercozoan</italic> exhibited the highest proportion in K13, accounting for 10.45% of the total number of amplicon reads. However, the most common taxa in the K11 sampling point were <italic>an uncultured_freshwater Eukaryote</italic>, accounting for 6.89% of the total number of amplicon reads. The most common taxa in the D10 sampling point belong to the class Craspedida, accounting for 50.89% of the total number of amplicon reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112812-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In contrasts, another species that affiliated with the class Craspedida was prevalent at sample site D11, accounting for 30.19% of the total number of amplicon reads. At stations T3 and T11, the eukaryal communities consisted mainly of uncultured_Scuticociliatia, and Monosiga brevicollis, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112812-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
<p>Lake Gahai is located quite far from Lake Gasikule. However, the compositions of the most common taxa in these lakes were quite similar. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112812-g005">Figure 5</xref>, one species that affiliated with the Mammalia family was prevalent at sample site G1 and M1, accounting for 28.81% and 23.35% of the total number of amplicon reads, respectively. However, in another hypersaline lake (X15), the most abundant sequences were affiliated with a species affiliated with phylum Bicosoecida (31.20%), which was also the next most common taxa in X12 sample site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112812-g005">Figure 5</xref>). As was shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112812-g005">Figure 5</xref>, the eukaryotic plankton assemblage was dominated by a species from the phylum Pavlovophyceae at the X12 sample site, accounting for 33.43% of the total number of amplicon reads.</p>
<p>Abundance tables of OTU were used to calculate Shannon’s diversity index and Simpson’s evenness. As indicated by the Observed species rarefaction curves, (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112812.s001">Figure S1</xref>), the shape of the curves indicates a trend of diminishing chance of finding new phylotypes as sampling continues. The estimated number of observed species varied between 86.20 and 250.80 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112812.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The highest diversity index was observed in Lake Keluke (Observed Species = 250.80), and the lowest diversity index was in Lake Dasugan (Observed Species = 86.20). The Chao1 estimator was calculated to predict the total number of OTUs (richness) in the water samples. The taxonomic richness estimated for the six lakes was 267.50, 208.14, 199.21, 101.75, 117.80, and 119.35 for Lakes Keluke, Gasikule, Gahai, Dasugan, Tuosu, and Xiaochaidan, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112812.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Considering the mean estimated richness in DNA datasets, Lake Keluke is the most diverse lake, closely followed by Lake Gsikule. Notably, eukaryotic plankton communities were more diverse in the hypersaline lakes compared to the mesosaline lakes.</p>

<title>Cluster Analysis</title>
<p>Phylogenetic tree reconstruction using the maximum likelihood (ML) with all sequence reads elucidated the diversity of eukaryotic plankton assemblages in lakes located in the Qaidam Basin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112812-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). There were approximately 1.90%, 9.04% and 15.85% OTUs defined as unclassified eukaryal clusters in fresh water lake, mesosaline lakes and hypersaline lakes, respectively. This highly supported tree was pivotal to place very divergent sequences that could not be classified into any known eukaryal class that could not be identified by BLAST. Interestingly, some novel OTUs affiliated within a given taxonomic group. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112812-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, about twelve novel OTUs were related to Holozoa groups. Nevertheless, at least four OTUs in mesosaline lake and eighteen OTUs in hypersaline lake could still not be related to any eukaryal taxonomic group, not even to a supergroup, and occupy highly unique branches in this phylogenetic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112812-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that most OTUs from hypersaline, mesosaline, and freshwater lakes tended to form separate groups and shared rather low similarities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112812-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
</sec><sec id="s3e">
<title>Novelty in each eukaryal class</title>
<p>After water samples were obtained and sequenced, the identity of the different microorganisms was analyzed by BLAST search. For each OTUs, the similarity to the CEM and the CCM was recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112812-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The results were further classified according to salinity concentration (i.e., mesosaline vs. hypersaline, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112812-g006">Figure 6A, B</xref>). The average CEM similarity (83%) was slightly lower than the average CCM similarity (83.87%) in hypersaline lakes. However, the average CEM similarity (89.96%) was much higher than the average CCM similarity (86.40%) in mesosaline lakes. We then analyzed the novelty of the taxonomic composition of the different assemblages. Each phylogenetic group exhibits a different novelty pattern, as observed with the supergroups Alveolates and Stramenopiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112812-g006">Figure 6</xref>). In the kingdom Stramenopiles, the median genetic diversity values were ≥75% for both cultured and environmental matches, with similar sequence identity distributions in hypersaline lakes. Conversely, only approximately 35% of the Stramenopiles group in mesosaline lake matched both cultured and environmental sequences. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112812-g006">Figure 6</xref>, dots below 80% similarity in both axes indicated highly divergent novel sequences. Notably, we observed that in mesosaline lakes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112812-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), at least four sequences had no similarity to CCM or CEM data, whereas in hypersaline lakes, up to eighteen OTUs yield generally low similarity values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112812-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). These OTUs were either not successfully cultured in the laboratory or have not been observed in nature.</p>

<title>Distribution of OTUs and Influence of Physicochemical Parameters</title>
<p>Lake Keluke contained the highest number of OTUs unique to one lake, which account for approximately 59.92% of all OTUs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112812.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Venn diagrams comparing the number of common OTUs among samples showed that the hypersaline lake Gasikule and the freshwater Lake Keluke had a relatively large overlap (approximately 137 OTUs) compared to other lakes. The smallest proportions of OTUs were shared between the freshwater Lake Keluke and the mesosaline Lake Dasugan (approximately 47 OTUs). OTUs that were present in all conditions were rare: only six such OTUs were observed in our data set.</p>
<p>To analyze the influence of eukaryotic plankton community structure and other measured physicochemical parameters, a distinct CCA was generated from pooled habitat datasets. CCA analysis of chemical variables yielded four clusters, separated mainly by altitude and the percentage of calcium ions. The first cluster contained hypersaline lake sample points (X12 and X15); the second contained large hypersaline lake sample points (M1, M7, G1 and G3); the third cluster contained freshwater lake sample points (K11 and K13), and the fourth cluster contained mesosaline lake sample points (D10, D11, T3, T11 and T12). Altitude and the calcium-ion percentage affected the eukaryotic community structure in Lake Xiaochaidan, whereas the calcium ion percentage and TN were major factors in Lakes Gahai and Gasikule. pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) were the most important factors influencing the distribution of eukaryotic plankton assemblages in Lakes Dasugan and Tuosu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112812-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The high-rank diversity observed in this study, both in terms of the eukaryotic supergroups detected and the presence and relative abundance of specific lineages, was typical of molecular surveys of eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Casamayor1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Wu1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-TriadMargarit1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Wolf1">[25]</xref>. Shannon rarefaction curves reached plateau in the present study, indicates that more intensive sampling is likely to yield only few additional species. As not expected, the lake with the most extreme conditions (hypersaline lake Gasikule) had the highest OTU diversity, followed by the lake with the second highest salinity (Gahai). Although the actual numbers have to be regarded with caution, it seems clear that this study (and the many more to come with improved technologies) will significantly raise the higher limit of eukaryotes diversity.</p>

Recent research showed that most of the 18S rRNA gene sequences affiliate with Stramenopiles, Cryptophyta and Alveolata in several alpine oligotrophic lakes of the Central Pyrenees (Spain) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-TriadMargarit1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Lefvre1">[63]</xref>. The taxonomic composition of the eukaryotic plankton assemblages, collected from freshwater Lake Keluke, differed from that reported in June 2012 from several alpine oligotrophic lakes of the Central Pyrenees (Spain) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-TriadMargarit1">[15]</xref>, where Stramenopiles, Cryptophyta and Alveolata dominated the 18S rRNA gene sequences. In the present study, Alveolata group represented a greater proportion of the community. Recent experiments by Mangot et al. (2013) showed that Almost 27% of the OTUs are affiliated with the Alveolates and more precisely the <italic>Ciliophora</italic> and <italic>Perkinsozoa</italic> taxa in freshwater Lake Geneva <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-TriadMargarit2">[64]</xref>. The dominance of Intramacronucleata within kingdom Alveolata in Lake Keluke highlights a difference in the composition of microbial eukaryotic communities between this lake and other lake.</p>
<p>From the general ecological principles it can be established that a more extreme environment is expected to be less species rich <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Mangot1">[65]</xref>. To our surprise, all the investigated saline lakes harbored remarkably diverse eukaryotic microbial communities, considering their higher salt concentrations. Mesosaline lake presented a different picture of the eukaryotic microorganisms community with freshwater lake. At least 7.10% of all sequences were related to unidentified eukaryal lineages in mesosaline lakes. Most 18S rRNA gene sequences obtained in mesosaline lakes were closely related to Holozoa (mainly Craspedida), differed from that reported in freshwater lake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-TerBraak1">[58]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Lepre1">[61]</xref>. Genetic diversity of eukaryotic plankton assemblages has been well investigated in marine ecosystems. However, there is very few published studies utilised cloning-free high throughput sequencing to estimate the eukaryotic diversity of mesosaline lake. 454 pyrosequencing analysis reveal that Stramenopiles, Alveolata, Ciliates, and Prasinophytes were the dominant picoeukaryote groups in subtropical coastal waters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Cheung1">[41]</xref>. The Stramenopiles constitute one of the major eukaryotic branches and include a vast number of heterotrophic and autotrophic groups with large ecological importance in the oceans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Logares1">[9]</xref>. Unlike in mesosaline lakes located in Qaidam Basin, in the Indian Ocean world, Alveolata and Stramenopiles are the most common groups, whereas Rhizaria are the next most abundant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Massana2">[24]</xref>. Recent experiments by Wolf et al. (2014) showed Alveolata (mainly Dinoflagellates) group are dominant in the sequence assemblage in the sub-Antarctic Zone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Wolf1">[25]</xref>. These were not in agreement with the present result that Holozoa (mainly Craspedida) group was most prevalent in mesosaline lakes located in Qaidam Basin.</p>
<p>Hypersaline systems are overwhelming dominated by prokaryotes, with communities dominated by the haloarchaea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Frontier1">[66]</xref>. However, eukaryotic organisms are also commonly present and might be play important ecological roles. In a study of 34 sites in different inland and coastal environments in Spain, most sequences are affiliated with Chloroplastida (mainly Chlorophyta), Alveolata, Stramenopiles, Opisthokonta, and Rhizaria, whereas Centroheliozoa, Haptophyceae, and Telonemida are less well represented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-TriadMargarit1">[15]</xref>. Chlorophyta have adapted to specialised and extreme environments, such as deserts, arctic environments, hypersaline habitats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-TriadMargarit1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Heidelberg1">[67]</xref>. A study of high mountain saline lakes of the Eastern Tibet Plateau showed that most sequences are affiliated with Chloroplastida (mainly Chlorophyta) and Alveolata (mainly Dinophyceae) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Wu1">[7]</xref>. As we not expect, Chloroplastida group was only observed in high abundance in Lake Gasikule, whereas was less represented in other hypersaline lakes such as Gahai and Xiaochaidan. Our finding that Holozoa (mainly Animalia) were the most common kingdom in hypersaline lakes in the Qaidam Basin was contrast with a recent research that water samples were dominated (91%) by a novel cluster of the Alveolate in hypersaline Lake Tyrrell (Australia) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Frontier1">[66]</xref>. These results were in agreement with previous reports that distinct biogeographical patterns are defined by the environmental conditions in particular regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Wolf1">[25]</xref>. The dominance of Holozoa (mainly Animalia) in water samples highlights a difference in the composition of eukaryotes between hypersaline lakes in the Qaidam Basin and other hypersaline environments.</p>
<p>It is of interest that Lake Xiaochaidan has the same salinity as Lake Gahai, but these lakes differed in the quantitative composition of their eukaryotic communities. Haptophyta were in high abundance in Lake Xiaochaidan, whereas present in lower numbers throughout coastal environments in Spain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-TriadMargarit1">[15]</xref>, Lake Gahai and Lake Gasikule. Several reasons might explain the different distributions of taxonomic groups in Lake Xiaochaidan compared to hypersaline lakes. First, Lake Xiaochaidan has been completely drained to exploit mineral resources in the last century, which has eliminated certain species, decreasing the abundance of the Holozoa group. Second, some species such as Alveolata, which are commonly observed in the freshwater Lake Keluke, might thrive because of freshwater injection. More interestingly, recent experiments by Charvet et al. (2014) showed that eukaryotic plankton assemblages in fresh waters were related to the Alveolata and in the lower saline waters were related to Stramenopiles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Lepre1">[61]</xref>. However, further studies are required to confirm this hypothesis. Nevertheless, these data are consistent with previous conclusions that human activity is one of the greatest threats to these ecologically valuable habitats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Williams1">[3]</xref>.</p>

<title>Novelty analysis of environmental sequences</title>
<p>The novelty analysis revealed highly divergent sequences that appeared in the area of the dispersion plot with very low CCM and/or CEM values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112812-g006">Figure 6</xref>). A recent reports showed that 10% of the entire dataset showing &lt;90% identity to any previously reported sequence in GenBank in 34 different coastal and inland saline ponds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-TriadMargarit1">[15]</xref>. Notably, approximately 32% and 37.98% of the entire dataset in mesosaline lakes and hypersaline lakes, respectively, had &lt;90% identity to previously reported sequences in GenBank (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112812-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Most of these sequences formed long branches in the ML phylogenetic tree, although some could be confidently placed in a taxonomic group based on the dendrogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112812-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The novelty level was also not equally distributed among the different taxa. In this study, Alveolata and Rhizaria contained the highest and lowest novelty, respectively, in hypersaline lakes. These results are not consistent with previous observations that Opisthokonta and Rhizaria contained the highest novelty and Chlorophyta and Alveolata contained the lowest novelty in 34 different coastal and inland saline ponds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-TriadMargarit1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, at least four OTUs in mesosaline lakes and eighteen OTUs in hypersaline lakes showed very low CCM and CEM scores, indicating that these OTUs are highly distantly related to any existing OTUs. As expected, phylogenetic analysis further showed that these OTUs occupy highly unique branches in phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112812-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Molecular approaches have been successfully used to estimate the diversity of eukaryotic plankton assemblages (largely, the protistan assemblages and picoeukaryotic communities) in marine ecosystems and have revealed a large and novel diversity of protists and other eukaryotic microorganisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Buchheim1">[68]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Countway1">[69]</xref>. Over a 4-year period, eukaryotic molecular surveys were performed and thousands of sequences were deposited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Casamayor1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Wu1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-TriadMargarit1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Wolf1">[25]</xref>. However, in this study, some OTUs still had no similarity to CCM or CEM data, yielding generally low similarity values. These OTUs could represent high-rank novel phylogenetic lineages and are obvious candidates for further research. Our data highlight incomplete culturing of the dominant eukaryotes in hypersaline environments in Qaidam Basin. From an evolutionary perspective, we are faced with very divergent sequences that could account for new, unexpected and fascinating evolutionary lineages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Massana2">[24]</xref>.</p>

<title>Influence of Salinity on Eukaryotic Plankton Assemblages</title>
<p>Understanding the spatial distribution of aquatic microbial diversity and the underlying mechanisms causing differences in community composition is a challenging task. Recent research suggested that distinct protist community assemblages are present in different large-scale water masses in the Southern Ocean <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Wolf1">[25]</xref>. Our data are consistent with this observation and have revealed the distinct distribution of eukaryotic plankton assemblages along a salinity gradient in the Qaidam Basin lakes. Notably, the eukaryotic plankton assemblage compositions were most variable between different sampling sites in the same lake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112812-g005">Figure 5</xref>). CCA analysis indicated that pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) were significantly correlated with the distribution of the eukaryotic plankton assemblages in Lakes Dasugan and Tuosu, whereas TN was a major factor influencing the taxonomic composition of eukaryotic plankton assemblages in Lakes Gahai and Gasikule (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112812.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The present result confirmed that environmental factor strongly influences the taxonomic composition of eukaryotic plankton assemblages in inland waters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Wu1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Lepere1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-TriadMargarit2">[64]</xref>.</p>
<p>The most important environmental gradients among the studied lakes were TDS in the present study. Previous reports also suggest that salinity and oxygen are important factors shaping the microbial composition in aquatic habitats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Wu1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Price1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Countway2">[70]</xref>. Our results suggest that TDS defined distinct eukaryotic plankton assemblages among lakes, whereas other factors affected the distribution of eukaryotic plankton assemblages within lakes. This hypothesis consist with previous reports that chlorine and carbonate ion percentages were the most important chemical variables potentially structuring the diversity of eukaryotic plankton assemblages in Eastern Tibetan lakes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Wu1">[7]</xref>. Oxygen (presence or absence), pH, Na<sup>+</sup>, and K<sup>+</sup> concentrations were significantly correlated with the OTU composition in Ethiopian soda lakes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112812-Lanzen1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>Inland saline lakes are extremely responsive to changes in climatic conditions and have significant ecological, economic, and cultural value; however, these lakes are threatened worldwide by diversion and pollution of their inflows, the introduction of exotic species, and economic development with changes in land use. This study shows that saline lakes in the Qaidam Basin, which are considered to be less species-rich most likely, harbored remarkably diverse eukaryotic microbial communities. Therefore, it is important to perform detailed studies and to develop active conservation strategies to preserve the microbial biodiversity in these areas. This result further highlights the major gap existing between the well-defined diversity and classification inferred from cultivated microorganisms, and their significantly larger natural diversity that is not yet well understood. These data provide the baseline information needed to further study the ecological context of the roles of microbial eukaryotes in the system.</p>
