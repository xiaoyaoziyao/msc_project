<abstract>
<p>Bacterial infection of lung airways underlies some of the main complications of COPD, significantly impacting disease progression and outcome. Colonization by bacteria may further synergize, amplify, or trigger pathways of tissue damage started by cigarette smoke, contributing to the characteristic airway inflammation and alveolar destruction of COPD. We sought to elucidate the presence and types of lung bacterial populations in different stages of COPD, aimed at revealing important insights into the pathobiology of the disease. Sequencing of the bacterial small subunit ribosomal RNA gene in 55 well-characterized clinical lung samples, revealed the presence of <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> spp. (&gt;2% abundance) in lungs of patients with GOLD 3-GOLD 4 COPD, cystic fibrosis and a subset of control individuals. <italic>Novosphingobium</italic>-specific quantitative PCR was concordant with the sequence data and high levels of <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> spp. were quantifiable in advanced COPD, but not from other disease stages. Using a mouse model of subacute lung injury due to inhalation of cigarette smoke, bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophil and macrophage counts were significantly higher in mice challenged intratracheally with <italic>N. panipatense</italic> compared to control mice (p&lt;0.01). Frequencies of neutrophils and macrophages in lung tissue were increased in mice challenged with <italic>N. panipatense</italic> at room air compared to controls. However, we did not observe an interaction between <italic>N. panipatense</italic> and subacute cigarette smoke exposure in the mouse. In conclusion, <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> spp. are present in more severe COPD disease, and increase inflammation in a mouse model of smoke exposure.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Diverse microbial communities are found in each of the different environments of human body, where they interact with resident inflammatory cells in both health and disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Human1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Grivennikov1">[6]</xref>. Recently, studies carried out by multiple consortiums and individual investigations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Human1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Telle1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Proctor1">[8]</xref> have contributed significantly to our understanding about the human microbiome. The respiratory tract, like the gastrointestinal and skin systems, is continuously exposed to environmental agents; moreover, many pulmonary diseases lead to increased risk of infections and altered microbial communities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Harris1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Zemanick1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Sethi1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Rogers1">[10]</xref>. It is anticipated that the better understanding of the microbiome in healthy and diseased lungs may better inform how diseases are modified in their course by infection and provide novel means to implement disease-specific treatments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Huang1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>Until the introduction of high throughput analysis of bacterial population using 16S ribosomal RNA amplification, the lungs of healthy individuals were thought to be sterile, while those of diseased patients were colonized with bacteria that were associated with disease, the advent of molecular techniques shows this not to be so <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-ErbDownward1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Baughman1">[13]</xref>. The lung is continuously challenged by inhaled particulates and microorganisms, and yet, healthy individuals rarely have bacteria isolated from their airways. In fact, there is a growing body of evidence of organisms, not identifiable by classical cultivation efforts, present within the human airway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Huang2">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Morris1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>Bacterial infections of the lung airways and parenchyma play a central role in the progression, severity, and outcome of airway diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Sethi1">[9]</xref>. COPD is largely caused by cigarette smoking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-National1">[18]</xref>, affecting approximately 16 million Americans and will become the third most common cause of worldwide morbidity in the next few years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Mannino1">[19]</xref>. Of particular importance in COPD are acute exacerbations caused by bacteria and viruses, contributing to morbidity, clinical deterioration, and mortality among patients with COPD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Wedzicha1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Pauwels1">[21]</xref>. Acute exacerbations (AE) in COPD are an acute and sustained progression of the disease beyond normal day-to-day variations, requiring change in medication and/or hospitalization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Martinez1">[22]</xref>. The average COPD patient has two episodes of acute exacerbations per year, with 10% requiring hospitalization that lasts on average approximately six days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-MacIntyre1">[23]</xref>. Bacteria account for 30–50% of overall AEs, while viruses are detected in 25% of cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Ball1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>Even patients with stable COPD (40%) have evidence of bacteria in their secretions, which are considered to represent colonization, often consisting of <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>, <italic>Moraxella catarrhalis</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Wedzicha1">[20]</xref>. A low microbial load, i.e., 10<sup>2</sup> to 10<sup>3</sup> colony forming units (cfu)/ml is seen in 25% of stable patients while 10% of stable patients may present with high bacterial load <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Veeramachaneni1">[25]</xref>. Colonization is associated with heightened expression of markers of inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Murphy1">[26]</xref>; colonized patients have also worse overall health and increased expression of serum fibrinogen, as a marker of systemic inflammation, when compared with COPD patients without colonization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Wedzicha2">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Seemungal1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>Sources of bacteria may also involve the environment and, in particular, processed tobacco and tobacco leaves. A recent study, based on SSU-rRNA, revealed multiple members of several phyla, including α-Proteobacteria, such as the genus <italic>Novosphingobium</italic>, in commercial cigarettes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Sapkota1">[29]</xref>. These findings complemented and expanded prior documentation of bacteria grown in standard cultures from processed cigarettes and cigarette filters, and of endotoxin in both cigarettes and samples of air in smoking environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Sapkota1">[29]</xref>. This evidence underscores the need for high throughput approaches that may identify whether processed tobacco (as present in cigarettes) might also be a source of bacterial infection, colonization and exposure, as the result of cigarette smoke inhalation.</p>
<p>Since the interplay of lung infection by bacterial and/or viruses and lung inflammation may synergize, amplify, or trigger pathways of tissue damage started by cigarette smoke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Martinez1">[22]</xref>, , we sought to identify whether unique bacterial populations are present in COPD lungs and might affect lung inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Cosio1">[31]</xref>. These insights might have broader implications in the understanding of any potential involvement of bacterial populations in the course of cigarette smoke-induced inflammation, alveolar injury (cell death), and clinical exacerbations.</p>

<title>Human Samples</title>
<p>All human material was approved through the Colorado Combined Institutional Review Board. Lung samples included subjects who were non-normal smoker’s lungs, normal smoker’s lungs, lung samples from donors with no or minimal disease (GOLD 1/2), and lungs with moderate/severe disease (GOLD 3/4) were obtained from the Lung Tissue Repository Consortium of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (LTRC). Freshly frozen lung samples from subjects with advanced cystic fibrosis disease were evaluated as controls for the presence of bacteria were obtained from the Colorado Children’s Hospital; freshly frozen normal nonsmokers’ and smokers’ samples consisted from explanted lungs, not used for lung transplantation, were provided by the National Jewish Health Interstitial Lung Disease Program biorepository. The clinical characteristics of the adult study population are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111150-t001">Table 1</xref>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111150-t001">Table 1</xref> does not contain information on all samples included due to lack of demographic information from some tissues sources. A single sample was examined in triplicate during sample processing, and the inclusion of the replicate libraries did not affect the overall results.</p>

<title>DNA Extraction and Reagent Controls</title>
<p>Prior to embedding tissue and extracting DNA for subsequent sequence analysis, reagents were tested for the presence of bacterial DNA. Two lung samples taken from patients with COPD (GOLD stage 1 and GOLD stage 4, respectively) were processed to check for potential contamination. Small fragments were taken from each sample and embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) embedding media, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and cut into 5 µm frozen sections. Controls included frozen sections of OCT media devoid of tissue fragments, prepared with the same equipment and consumables used for tissues. All-bacteria qPCR analysis was performed, and based on the presence of DNA in the OCT liquid alone (387 copies) versus COPD GOLD stage 1 (713 copies), versus GOLD stage 4 (1645 copies) compared to 35 copies in the qPCR (reagent) blanks, subsequent reagents underwent UV treatment before embedding in order to reduce background.</p>
<p>All DNA extractions were performed using the Qiagen EZ1 Advanced Extraction Platform with the Tissue Kit and Bacterial Card as per manufacturer’s instructions. Elution volume of 100 µl was selected and elution tubes with DNA extract were stored at −20°C. All extraction reagents were negative for bacterial DNA contamination.</p>

<title>Quantification of <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> spp. in Lung Tissue Samples</title>
<p>The extracted DNA was amplified using pan-bacterial primers for the first round PCR. Primers were synthesized commercially (Integrated DNA Technologies, IA). The 27F forward primer <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′</named-content> and 805R reverse primer <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-GACTACCAGGGTATCTAAT-3′</named-content>. Reactions were initiated at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 27 cycles of 94°C for 15 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s. Subsequent amplification was performed using <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> spp. specific primers, forward primer <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-TCCGAGTGTAGAGGTGAAAT-3′</named-content> which recognizes several sequences in the α-Proteobacteria and reverse primer <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-CGTCAATACTTGTCCAGTCA-3′</named-content> which has high specificity for <italic>Novosphingobium</italic>. Each quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) reaction contained 10 µl of “SYBR Green Master Mix” (Applied Biosystems Inc), 0.2 µl each of the <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> forward and reverse primers at 3 µM each, 5.6 µl of DNA free water (Fisher Scientific, CA), and 4 µl of primary PCR product. Assays were performed using the Mastercycler EP Realplex (Eppendorf, USA). Reactions were initiated at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 s, annealing at 61°C for 15 s. Dissociation or melting reaction, to determine the specificity of the products on the basis of the melting temperature, consisted of incubation at 95°C for 15 s, annealing at 60°C for 20 s, followed by slowly increasing the temperature to 95°C over 20 min. A single peak was obtained with the absence of any extra peak(s). The detection limit of the PCR assay (standard curve method) was less than100 genome equivalents of <italic>Novosphingobium panipatense</italic> per reaction. The electrophoresis run for the PCR products indicated specificity of a product band of ∼100 base pairs corresponding to the <italic>Novosphingobium panipatense</italic> gene product (data not shown).</p>
<p>Initial attempts to perform <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> spp. specific qPCR resulted in the amplification of multiple products due to the presence of both the pan-bacterial primers that may have carried over from the first round of PCR amplification, and the <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> spp. primers used for the second round of amplification. In order to eliminate the amplification of non-specific products in subsequent steps, the first round PCR product underwent a cleanup treatment with EXOSAP-IT as per manufacturer’s instructions with minor modifications (samples were treated with EXOSAP-IT at 37°C overnight (for 15–18 hours) followed by 15 minutes at 80°C to inactivate the reaction). This step removed unwanted dNTPs and primers that remained from the first round PCR product before proceeding to perform nested PCR or qPCR. Melting Curves confirmed that the PCR products amplified after performing EXOSAP-IT cleanup treatment resulted in PCR product that demonstrated melting curves similar to those seen with the <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> DSZM stocks (80°C).</p>

<p>To demonstrate the effects of <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> spp. infection in lung compartments, such as airways and alveolated tissue, C57BL/6 mice in the experimental group were challenged once every seven days with 50 µl of PBS containing 5×107 CFU total of Novosphingobium panipatense for a total of six weeks (i.e. six bacterial intratracheal challenges given at a rate of one challenge per week), while control mice were subjected to challenges with 50 µl sterile PBS, instilled intratracheally. Mice were then exposed to room air conditions for six weeks or were exposed for six weeks to cigarette smoke generated by the TE-10 Smoking Machine (Teague Enterprises) and 3R4F reference cigarettes (University of Kentucky, Tobacco Research Institute, Lexington), as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Yoshida1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Rangasamy1">[44]</xref>.

Each smoldering cigarette was puffed for 2 seconds, once every minute for a total of 8 puffs, at a flow rate of 1.05 l/min, to provide a standard puff of 35 cm<sup>3</sup>. The smoke machine was adjusted to produce a mixture of side stream smoke (89%) and mainstream smoke (11%) by burning between 3–6 cigarettes at one time. This smoke was then mixed with room air and transferred to the smoking chamber at a flow rate of 25 liters per minute. Chamber atmosphere was monitored for total suspended particulates and carbon monoxide, with concentrations of 110 mg/m<sup>3</sup> and 350 ppm, respectively.

Total viable cell counts were determined in a hemocytometer using trypan blue exclusion. Differential counts of neutrophils and macrophages were determined on cytospin smears of BAL samples. In brief, 150 µL of cell suspension was centrifuged in a Shandon Single Cytofunnel (Thermo Scientific, USA) at 650 rpm for 3 minutes.

<title>Clearance of <italic>Novosphingobium panipatense</italic> from mouse lungs</title>
<p>The lung is continuously exposed to bacteria in inhaled air.

However, we were surprised to obtain sequence data that revealed the presence of <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> spp. at high relative abundance (&gt;2% relative abuncance) in both normal lungs and diseases lungs. Within diseased lungs, levels of <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> spp. were observed more frequently in samples from subjects with advanced COPD (GOLD stage 3 and 4, 18/27 samples) compared to samples from subjects either not at risk or with early-moderate COPD (GOLD stage 0, 1 and 2, 4/11 samples). Our results are in concordance with several other clinical studies that have reported the presence of lung microbiota in patients with COPD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-ErbDownward1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Sze1">[48]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Pragman1">[51]</xref>. Our data confirms prior studies that have reported <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> spp. sequences from lung tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-ErbDownward1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Sze1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Huang4">[52]</xref>. It is important to note that the high relative abundance of <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> spp. has not been highlighted in other settings.</p>
<p>To date, a clear connection between microbiome diversity and respiratory disease has not been well described. Moreover, no further attempts have been made previously to use deep bacterial sequencing to identify potentially pathogenic bacteria. In particular, the contribution and role of sphingomonads such as <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> in diseased and healthy lungs remains unclear. To address this goal, we developed a <italic>Novosphingobium</italic>-specific qPCR to quantify levels of <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> spp. in the human lung tissue. Quantitative PCR was concordant with prior sequence data and high levels of <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> were quantifiable in advanced COPD, but not from other COPD disease stages. The <italic>Novosphingobium</italic>-specific qPCR demonstrates the potential for sensitive and high throughput approaches to defining and quantifying specific bacteria.</p>
<p>The finding of abundant and frequent detection of <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> spp. in human samples was initially intriguing. Given that <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> spp. are α-Proteobacteria, common in soil and at liquid surfaces (i.e., water pools), we were concerned that it represented a procedural contaminant. The aggregate of evidence argues against this hypothesis. Firstly, we determined that the lung samples provided by the LTRC were collected from multiple academic sites, at different periods of time. Secondly, we also detected <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> DNA in lung tissue, which was processed (i.e., sectioned, aliquoted, frozen, and stored) at different sites. Thirdly, several internal controls involving the procedural steps of DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and sequencing also failed to reveal potential sources of contamination. Importantly, most of the microbiome studies to date aimed at samples obtained from patients with asthma and COPD detected <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> spp. in the bronchoalveolar, brushing, and lung tissue DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-ErbDownward1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Sze1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Huang4">[52]</xref>, however at different abundance as that found in our studies.</p>
<p>Several pieces of evidence lead us to focus on <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> spp. Rather than containing lipopolysaccharide present in Gram negative bacteria, the family <italic>Sphingomonadaceae</italic> (which include the genera <italic>Novosphingobium</italic>, <italic>Sphingomonas</italic>, and <italic>Sphyngopyxis</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Takeuchi1">[53]</xref>, contains sphingolipids in their wall and are capable of metabolizing polyaromatic hydrocarbons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Shi1">[47]</xref>, as present in tobacco leaves. <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> spp. have been found to be present in multiple environmental surfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Kelley1">[54]</xref>, as a contaminant in respiratory therapy items <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Lemaitre1">[55]</xref>. <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> spp. typically grows in nutrient agar at 30°C, which may explain why these bacteria were not detected in clinical studies of acute exacerbations in COPD. Infection or colonization of vertebrate hosts, including humans, can however occur at 37°C as documented of sporadic infection by <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> of humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Ryan1">[56]</xref>. A potentially important implication of a pathogenic role for <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> spp. in COPD is the association of <italic>Novosphingobium aromaticivorans</italic> in primary biliary cirrhosis, an autoimmune disease of the liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Kaplan1">[46]</xref>, in which the signature anti-antibody against the mitochondria pyruvate dehydrogenase complex also recognizes the bacterial enzyme ortholog <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Mattner1">[45]</xref>. Due to the increasing data that supports autoimmunity as a potential component to the exacerbation of COPD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Cosio1">[31]</xref>, there was compelling evidence to move forward and analyze these bacteria, as it may have effects on the lung system in addition to the liver. In this present study, we confirmed that COPD lung samples can be segregated as containing high or low <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> spp. burden.</p>
<p>We then used a sub-acute inflammation mouse model to mimic acute lung inflammation and to quantify innate immune cell sub-populations responding to <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> bacterial challenge IT, in the presence and the absence of cigarette smoke. BAL from C57BL/6 mice challenged IT with <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> spp. and exposed to cigarette smoke demonstrated increased levels of neutrophils and macrophages compared to room air controls. In addition, by flow cytometry, we determined the populations of specific inflammatory cells in mouse lung tissue-recovered cells. Compared with PBS- inoculated control animals at room air, mice challenged IT with live <italic>N. panipatense</italic> exhibited an increase in the numbers of neutrophils. The total number of resident and recruited macrophages was increased in the mouse lung tissue-recovered cells. <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> appears to induce an inflammatory response in mice that subsequently clears and/or controls the infection. The effect of <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> spp. on the inflammatory response, in conjunction with cigarette smoke, was unclear and requires further clarification. This limited response could be accounted by the inability to accurately model the chronic lung injury imposed by decades of cigarette smoking in an abbreviated time frame of 6 weeks in the mouse. Moreover, this model may not reproduce the immunologic and structural abnormalities seen in patients with the disease.</p>
<p>Longitudinal analysis in COPD patient populations may help to uncover the effects and contributions of these microbial populations in the lung. Clarifying the presence of specific microbiota in the lung may help to reveal under-recognized bacterial species that potentially are pathogenic or that may alter the microbiome during or by inducing, inflammation and airway destruction. Notwithstanding, this study does present with some limitations that include the absence of a primary species and human isolate of <italic>Novosphingobium</italic>. The dynamics of bacterial colonization in the lung, particularly during the different stages of disease, are not well understood; therefore recognition of the specific bacterial colonization in lung disease could lead to increased understanding of their roles in disease. Another limitation of the study may be the bacterial challenge dose that was administered to the mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111150-Patrone1">[57]</xref>. Different bacterial doses of <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> spp. may have an effect on the immune response of the host and on the inflammatory response that results. The infectious dose for <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> spp. is unknown and likely differs depending upon the host. Finally, the use of a mouse model to reflect sub-acute COPD in humans may also be limiting.</p>
<p>The study presented here sought to investigate the role of <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> spp. in a sub-acute inflammation mouse model, and is one of few studies that have explored the functional effects of the microbiome in lung disease. We postulated that Novosphingobium in the presence of disease may have a different function and play a role in disease progression and as such, embarked on using an animal model, incorporating both cigarette smoke and bacterial challenge to verify the hypothesis that Novosphingobium would be increased in COPD, and also to determine a possible role of Novosphingobium in lung inflammation and disease. In this mild model of COPD, the immune response of the animals was sufficient to clear the organism even with repeated challenge. Novosphingobium may therefore unlikely be pathogenic, alternatively the mouse model may not be the most suitable host in which to determine the role of the Novosphingobium bacteria. It therefore remains unclear what long-term exposure would reveal in a more suitable host. We found Novosphingobium in control, smokers’ and diseased samples. Novosphingobium therefore appears to be part of a normal lung microbiome. However, it is conceivable that it may play pathogenic roles, notably in a diseased lung. The results of this analysis contribute to current knowledge and extend previous reports about the airway bacterial microbiome in the context of lung disease.</p>
