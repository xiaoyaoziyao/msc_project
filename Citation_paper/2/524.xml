				<p>The developmental and temporal succession patterns and disturbance responses of phyllosphere bacterial communities are largely unknown. These factors might influence the capacity of human pathogens to persist in association with those communities on agriculturally-relevant plants. In this study, the phyllosphere microbiota was identified for Romaine lettuce plants grown in the Salinas Valley, CA, USA from four plantings performed over 2 years and including two irrigation methods and inoculations with an attenuated strain of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7. High-throughput DNA pyrosequencing of the V5 to V9 variable regions of bacterial 16S rRNA genes recovered in lettuce leaf washes revealed that the bacterial diversity in the phyllosphere was distinct for each field trial but was also strongly correlated with the season of planting. <named-content content-type="phyllum" xlink:type="simple">Firmicutes</named-content> were generally most abundant in early season (June) plantings and <named-content content-type="order" xlink:type="simple">Proteobacteria</named-content> comprised the majority of bacteria recovered later in the year (August and October). Comparisons within individual field trials showed that bacterial diversity differed between sprinkler (overhead) and drip (surface) irrigated lettuce and increased over time as the plants grew. The microbiota were also distinct between control and <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7-inoculated plants and between <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7-inoculated plants with and without surviving pathogen cells. The bacterial inhabitants of the phyllosphere therefore appear to be affected by seasonal, irrigation, and biological factors in ways that are relevant for assessments of fresh produce food safety.</p>

			<title>Introduction</title>
			<p>The phyllosphere, or total above-ground surfaces of plants, is a habitat for a variety of microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. At 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>7</sup> cells/g plant material, bacteria are typically the most abundant colonizers in the phyllosphere and constitute approximately 10<sup>26</sup> cells globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Plant pathogens can be members of the microbiota, but the majority of inhabitants are commensal without a known direct detriment or benefit to the plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Species of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Erwinia</italic></named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Pseudomonas</italic></named-content> represent some of the most commonly studied plant epiphytes, although recent investigations have shown a much broader diversity of microorganisms in the phyllosphere, including human pathogens and other bacterial species not previously found in that microbial habitat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p>
			<p>Leafy green produce has been associated with numerous large outbreaks of foodborne illness and is now regarded to be a significant vector of human pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Many of these outbreaks were traced back to the Salinas Valley, CA, USA, where more than 70% of U.S.-produced lettuce is grown. In particular, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, such as serotype O157:H7, has been linked to consumption of leafy greens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Field-based studies investigating <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7 population dynamics on lettuce found that the pathogen does not typically colonize plants in high levels but can persist in low numbers, on a fraction of plants, long after inoculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, because the infective dose of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7 is as few as 10 cells, even a low amount of the pathogen is considered a threat for human infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p>
			<p>A variety of environmental parameters including ultraviolet light, relative humidity, and temperature likely influence the viability of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7 on plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The indigenous phyllosphere microbiota might also be influenced by these parameters and then contribute (in)directly to the promotion or prevention of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7 survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, the contributions of these microorganisms to the long-term persistence of the pathogen are currently unclear. Investigations into pathogen-microbiota interactions are difficult because although the phyllosphere microbiota have been identified from multiple plant species, geographical locations, and environmental regimes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], the relative dominance of different (a) biotic factors on the epiphytic bacterial diversity for any single plant species has yet to be investigated. In this study, our aim was to identify and compare the bacterial diversity in the lettuce phyllosphere at a single geographical site over time during four field trials that included different irrigation methods and inoculation with an attenuated strain of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7. This information is needed to systematically assess whether specific field-associated microorganisms or microbial consortia contribute to the differential survival of human pathogens on leafy green produce.</p>

				<title>Field conditions and inoculation of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7</title>
				<p>A field in the Salinas Valley, CA, USA was the site of four field trials in 2009 and 2010. Permits and approvals for use of this United States-owned land were granted by the United States Department of Agriculture. Trials conducted in June were designated as early season (E) and August and October as late season (L). Experimental design of the field trials was described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Briefly, plants were grown according to standard commercial practices in a split-block design with three blocks irrigated by overhead-sprinkler (sprinkler) and three blocks irrigated by surface-drip (drip). Temperature and relative humidity measurements were recorded at least every 15 min in the field with a HOBO weather station data logger (Onset, Bourne, MA). For each field trial, 4-week old Romaine lettuce cv. Green Towers (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Lactuca sativa</named-content></italic>) plants were spray-inoculated in the morning (9-10 am) using spray bottles containing 10<sup>7</sup> CFU/ml of a rifampicin-resistant isolate of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7 ATCC700728 (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7) (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA USA) in a suspension of 0.1% peptone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] buffer. Strain ATCC700728 is an attenuated, non-toxigenic, strain of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7 lacking <italic>stx1</italic> and <italic>stx2</italic>, the genes for shiga-like toxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7 was delivered by a single spray in an amount of approximately 1 ml to yield a total inoculum density of 10<sup>7</sup> CFU/plant. In all field trials, control plants were collected from the same block and were not sprayed. In 2010, an additional set of control plants were collected that were sprayed with 0.1% peptone buffer<italic>. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7 cell density in the spray bottles was confirmed by enumeration on tryptic soy agar (TSA) containing 50 µg/ml rifampicin.</p>

				<title>Lettuce sampling</title>
				<p>Following inoculation of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7, 48 lettuce plants per time point were randomly sampled at 0 and 2 hours post-inoculation (hpi) and then at 2, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days post-inoculation (dpi). Typically 12 sprinkler- and 12 drip-irrigated lettuce plants were collected from each of the inoculated and control treatment groups. Lettuce heads were harvested by cutting approximately 3 cm above the soil surface with a sterile scalpel and then individually packed in sterile 1.6 L Whirl-Pak bags (Nasco, FT. Atkinson, WI). The bagged plants were immediately placed on ice in a cooler for transport to the laboratory for further processing within 24 h after collection.</p>

			<sec id="s2.3">
				<title>Enumeration of bacteria in the phyllosphere</title>
				<p>Enumeration of the bacterial cell densities on lettuce was performed for whole lettuce plants collected until 14 dpi. At 21 and 28 dpi, the plants were too large for processing, and therefore all of the outer leaves and leaves located concentrically inwards up to 50 g of plant were collected for analysis. The older, outer leaves were selected because they were present at the time of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7 inoculation. The lettuce was submerged in 0.1% peptone buffer in Whirl-Pak bags (50 to 250 ml) and immediately washed by either homogenization or sonication to dislodge the bacterial cells. For the 2009 field trials, lettuce was homogenized in a Stomacher 400 laboratory blender (Seward, Westbury, NY) for 2 min at medium speed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. For the 2010 field trials, the lettuce was sonicated for 7 min in a Branson 8510 Ultrasonicator water bath (Branson Ultrasonics Corporation, Danbury, CT). An automated spiral plater (Autoplate 4000, Spiral Biotech Inc., Boston, MA) was then used to plate serial dilutions of leaf washes onto TSA containing 25 µg/ml natamycin to inhibit fungal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Bacterial concentrations were enumerated on TSA after an overnight incubation at ambient temperature (approximately 22°C). The remaining homogenate or sonicate leaf washes were transferred to 50 ml tubes and centrifuged at 3220 x g for 15 min. The supernatant was decanted and the pellet stored at -80 °C until DNA extraction.</p>
				<p>Up to and including 7 dpi, culturable <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7 ATCC700728 were enumerated from the lettuce washes by plating serial dilutions on TSA containing 50 µg/ml rifampicin. At 14, 21, and 28 dpi, the amounts of the <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7 inoculant were too low for detection by plating, and hence enrichment was performed by submerging the plants in approximately 150 ml of tryptic soy broth (TSB) containing 50 µg/ml rifampicin and incubating at 42°C overnight. Cell suspensions were then plated onto CHROMagar O157 (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and incubated at 37°C overnight. The presence of viable <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7 cells in the enrichments was indicated by the presence of magenta-colored colonies on CHROMagar.</p>

			<sec id="s2.4">
				<title>DNA extraction</title>
				<p>Genomic DNA was extracted from the concentrated cell suspensions washed from plants using a modified protocol employing the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Briefly, 180 µl of the frozen leaf wash (between 10 to 25% of the cell pellet) was added to lysis buffer (200 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris, 20 mM EDTA, and 20 mg/ml lysozyme, pH 8.0) in sterile 2 ml tubes containing 0.5 g of 0.1 mm zirconia/silica beads (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK). Samples were shaken for 2 min at 6.5 m/s in a MP FastPrep-24 tissue and cell homogenizer (MP Bio, Santa Ana, CA, USA) and then incubated at 95°C for 5 min to lyse bacterial cells. The resulting genomic DNA was treated with proteinase K and purified on a QIAamp spin column (Qiagen).</p>

				<title>Quantitative real-time PCR</title>
				<p>Real-time PCR was used to quantify the total bacterial abundance in the phyllosphere. Universal 16S rRNA primer pairs 534F <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5’ CCAGCAGCCGCGGTAAT 3’</named-content> and 783R 5’ ACCMGGGTATCTAATCCKG 3’ were used to amplify bacterial DNA while limiting chloroplast DNA amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The 20 µl reactions contained 10 µl of SsoFAST<sup>TM</sup> EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), 2 µl of each primer (12.5 µM stock), and 2 µl template DNA. The reactions were performed on an Applied Biosystems 7500 FAST real-time PCR system (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA) first by heating the samples for 3 min at 95°C and then 40 cycles of 5 s at 95°C and 30 s at 53°C. Bacterial cell densities were estimated using comparisons of Ct values to an <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7 genomic DNA standard curve. To confirm the absence of contaminating DNA, negative controls including all reagents except for template DNA were performed for all PCR runs.</p>

			<sec id="s2.6">
				<title>Pyrosequencing and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis</title>
				<p>The 16S rRNA V5 to V9 regions from phyllosphere microbiota genomic DNA were amplified by PCR using bar-coded 799f [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and 1492r [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] primers as done previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. This primer pair was previously used to amplify 16S rRNA genes from bacteria associated from plants while limiting chloroplast DNA amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. PCR products were run on an agarose gel and the bacterial DNA band was excised and purified. Negative controls were included in all PCR runs and confirmed the absence of contaminating DNA. The concentrations and qualities of DNA were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen double stranded DNA assay (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Equal concentrations of DNA were used for emulsion PCR following protocols developed by Roche 454 Life Sciences. Sequencing was performed at The Core for Applied Genomics and Ecology (CAGE) at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln on the GS-FLX 454 Titanium platform (454 Life Sciences, Brandford, CT, USA). The sequences are available in the NCBI BioProject database with the project identification number SUB148767 (sample accession numbers: SAMNO1882564 to SAMNO1882785).</p>
				<p>The Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] software package was used to analyze the 16S rRNA sequences. Prior to taxonomic and phylogenetic analysis, the DNA sequences were subjected to the following preprocessing steps and quality controls: (i) sequences with incorrect bar codes or more than two primer mismatches were removed; (ii) sequences containing windows of 50 consecutive base pairs with an average quality score of less than 20 were truncated at the start of the low quality region; and (iii) sequences with less than 200 bp or more than 600 bp, not including bar codes were also not considered. The data set was de-replicated using cd-hit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] with a 97% identity cutoff, and labeled as Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). Representative sequences for each OTU were aligned in QIIME using the PyNast algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and phylogenetic trees of the assigned OTUs were created using FastTree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Chimeras were identified and removed from the data set using ChimeraSlayer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Finally, all OTUs with fewer than 10 reads per sample were removed from the data set.</p>
				<p>The QIIME sequence analysis pipeline was used for taxonomic assignment using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier and the RDP10 database (training set 6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and for alpha- and beta-diversity sample comparisons according to Phylogenetic Diversity (PD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], cluster quality, and the UniFrac distances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Statistical analysis and heat map construction was performed in QIIME and R (http://www.r-project.org). UniFrac distance matrices were created using 300 sub-sampled sequences per sample averaged over 10 iterations and used for principal coordinate analyses (PCoA) and unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA).</p>

				<p>The average number of bacteria per gram of leaf tissue increased 3- to 12-fold from 2 dpi to 28 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068642-g001">Figure 1)</xref>. Except for plants collected in L09, sprinkler irrigated lettuce frequently contained more culturable bacteria than lettuce irrigated by drip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068642-g001">Figure 1)</xref>. Plants from the L09 trial harbored similar numbers of bacteria independent of irrigation method and the highest bacterial quantities compared with the other trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068642-g001">Figure 1)</xref>. The effects observed in L09 might be at least partially attributable to a heavy rainstorm that occurred 2 dpi. Otherwise, the average temperature and relative humidity varied minimally between plantings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068642.s009">Table S1</xref>).</p>
				<p>Because colony enumerations can underestimate the total number of bacterial cells in the phyllosphere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], we also applied real-time PCR to quantify bacterial abundance on lettuce plants. 16S rDNA-targeted quantification showed that culturing on TSA typically resulted in the detection of only 1 to 10% of the total number of bacterial cells on lettuce (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068642.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Based on these values, the number of bacteria in the phyllosphere ranged from log 5.1 to log 7.7 cells/g plant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068642.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Notably, this estimate is based on real-time PCR using total genomic DNA which might also include DNA from non-viable bacterial cells recovered from the plant surface.</p>
				<p>As found previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], the number of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7 cells declined rapidly in the lettuce phyllosphere. Within 7 days after inoculation, viable <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7 levels were below the detection limit for colony enumeration by plating and only a fraction of the plants were positive (InocPOS) for the organism by enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068642.s010">Table S2</xref>). The other <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7-inoculated plants lacked any <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7 cells (InocNEG), as determined by enrichment.</p>

Therefore, to identify possible associations between the phyllosphere microbiota and <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7 survival on individual lettuce plants, we compared the density of aerobic bacteria cultured on TSA and by real-time PCR for InocPOS and InocNEG plants collected between 2 and 28 dpi.

				<title>Phyllosphere microbiota varied according to season</title>
				<p>Comparisons between the phyllosphere microbiota from lettuce revealed several significant trends. Firstly, the proportions of bacterial genera were distinct on each lettuce plant studied, even among plants collected on the same sampling date (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068642.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Secondly, pairwise comparisons using weighted UniFrac distances showed that the diversity and proportions of bacteria on lettuce within the same trial were typically more similar to each other than to bacteria collected in other field trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068642-g004">Figure 4)</xref>.</p>

				<p>However, despite these differences, there were also similarities between plants and among the field trials. In particular, bacterial diversity on lettuce was associated with the season of planting (early versus late) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068642-g004">Figure 4)</xref>. To this regard, comparisons between the proportions of abundant bacterial genera on individual plants yielded two clusters (I and II) that were clearly distinguished by the season of planting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068642-g005">Figure 5)</xref>. Of 109 plants in cluster I, 83 were from the late season (L09 or L10) trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068642-g005">Figure 5)</xref>. <named-content content-type="order" xlink:type="simple">Proteobacteria</named-content> were dominant during those field trials and primarily included members of the <named-content content-type="domain" xlink:type="simple">Enterobacteriaceae</named-content> and <named-content content-type="family" xlink:type="simple">Pseudomonadaceae</named-content> families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068642-g003">Figure 3A and B)</xref>.

				<title>Temporal and irrigation effects on the phyllosphere microbiota</title>
				<p>Within individual field trials, the bacterial composition on lettuce was typically distinct at each time point (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1)</xref>.

The Chao1 species richness metric also positively correlated with the PD estimator (r<sup>2</sup>=0.89, data not shown).

For example, a temporal change in bacterial composition on lettuce was evident between 7 dpi and 21 dpi in L10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068642-g007">Figure 7A)</xref>. At 14 dpi, the microbiota were typically similar to plants collected at either 7 dpi or 21 dpi, possibly indicating a transition from lower to higher bacterial diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068642-g007">Figure 7A)</xref>.</p>

				<title>The phyllosphere microbiota differed on plants inoculated with <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7</title>
				<p>Inoculation of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7 altered the phyllosphere to the extent that the lettuce microbiota differed between inoculated and control plants for 10 of the 12 time points examined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068642.s007">Figure S7</xref>). The result for one of the time points, 14 dpi in L10, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068642-g007">Figure 7C</xref>. Notably, the phyllosphere microbiota recovered from naive (not sprayed) and buffer-only inoculated plants were indistinguishable and differences associated with other factors were more important determinants of the bacterial diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068642-g007">Figure 7C and S8)</xref>. Therefore the differences in bacterial inhabitants were most likely due to <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7 and not the 0.1% peptone buffer used to deliver the pathogen onto the lettuce.</p>
				<p>The bacterial community composition was also distinct between InocPOS and InocNEG plants for nine of the 12 time points sampled, including 14 dpi in L10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068642-g007">Figure 7D)</xref>. These differences were partially associated with the enrichment of certain bacteria. For example, at 14 dpi in L10, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Erwinia</italic></named-content> was significantly enriched in the phyllosphere of InocNEG plants (<italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05) according to the Kruskal-Wallis multiple comparison test. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Erwinia</italic></named-content> was also enriched on InocNEG plants 2.7-fold and 9.2-fold at 14 and 21 dpi in the L09 trial. However, the opposite trend was seen at 7 dpi in L09, and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Erwinia</italic></named-content> was not present at significant levels in E09 and E10.</p>

			<p>The bacterial inhabitants of the Romaine lettuce phyllosphere were identified for plants grown in the same field during different times of year over 2 years and exposed to distinct abiotic (irrigation) and biotic (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7) conditions. This work constitutes an in-depth investigation of the microbial community dynamics in the phyllosphere and is the first to examine the possible reciprocal effects between a human pathogen and the indigenous bacterial inhabitants on field-grown plants. We found that the phyllosphere is colonized by a microbiota that is predominantly distinguished by season of planting and shows significant day-to-day variation. Comparisons among plants collected on the same day revealed that the microbiota also differed depending on the irrigation method, inoculation of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7, and the presence or absence of viable <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7 cells 7, 14, and 21 days after inoculation.</p>
			<p>Overall, the phyllosphere is less diverse compared with other microbial habitats, most notably soil and marine environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. We identified a total of 652 OTUs in the lettuce phyllosphere with each plant containing an average of 36 ± 19 total OTUs. This amount is approximately four-fold less than what was previously reported for Romaine lettuce in the Salinas Valley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], but comparable to the total bacterial diversity found in the phyllosphere of other plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Moreover, we found that only a limited number of bacteria representing between 1 to 10% of the total cells on lettuce were routinely culturable on standard laboratory medium, and this finding is supported by other investigations of bacterial epiphytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p>
			<p><named-content content-type="order" xlink:type="simple">Proteobacteria</named-content>, <named-content content-type="phyllum" xlink:type="simple">Firmicutes</named-content>, and <named-content content-type="phyllum" xlink:type="simple">Actinobacteria</named-content> were the dominant bacterial phyla identified on Romaine lettuce. These phyla constitute the majority of bacterial inhabitants of numerous plant species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. However, unlike other studies, we found higher proportional numbers of <named-content content-type="phyllum" xlink:type="simple">Firmicutes</named-content>. For 67 out of 223 total plants sampled from the field trials, <named-content content-type="phyllum" xlink:type="simple">Firmicutes</named-content> made up greater than 50% of the microbiota and the majority of these plants came from the E09 or E10 plantings. <named-content content-type="phyllum" xlink:type="simple">Firmicutes</named-content> that were represented in high proportions in the phyllosphere included lactic acid bacteria (LAB), and the LAB genera <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Leuconostoc</italic></named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Lactococcus</italic></named-content> were among the six most abundant genera identified in this study. Other LAB were also found in the phyllosphere in lower abundance, including <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Enterococcus</italic></named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Streptococcus</italic></named-content>, and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Lactobacillus</italic></named-content>. LAB were previously found on lettuce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], however, these bacteria have generally not been found on plant surfaces in measurable quantities in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Such differences might be the result of variation in leaf washing or DNA extraction methods. The latter is likely most critical because we found that different methods for bacterial removal (sonication and homogenization) resulted in the recovery of similar quantities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068642-g001">Figure 1)</xref> and diversity of bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068642-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068642-g004">4)</xref>. In contrast, DNA extraction methods strongly influenced the diversity of bacteria detected from other habitats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. In particular, the use of bead-beating improved the extraction of DNA from a wider-variety of bacterial cells, most notably from Gram positive bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Clearly, technical differences are important to consider when comparing datasets from multiple investigators, and ultimately efforts should be made to improve protocols so that all bacterial species inhabiting the phyllosphere can be adequately examined.</p>
			<p><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Pantoea</italic></named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Erwinia</italic></named-content>, among other members of the <named-content content-type="domain" xlink:type="simple">Enterobacteriaceae</named-content>, are often common colonists of plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] and were among the most abundant genera found on lettuce during the field trials. Additionally, we identified three groups of sequences belonging to the <named-content content-type="domain" xlink:type="simple">Enterobacteriaceae</named-content> family that were not classified as known genera. Clades 1 and 3 were relatively abundant on both early and late season plants and often found together in the phyllosphere. Clade 2 was found primarily on late season plants. Sequencing errors can lead to the false discovery of unknown OTUs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], however, because representatives of these clades were found in high amounts on numerous plants from different field trials, the clades we identified might indicate the presence of novel bacterial species unique to the phyllosphere. This finding needs to be confirmed using independent methods designed to detect, quantify, and isolate these bacteria from plants.</p>
			<p>The culturable and total cell densities on lettuce were similar for all field trials indicating that the bacterial population sizes on plants are constrained by the carrying capacity of the leaves. In contrast, the relative proportions of bacterial genera inhabiting the lettuce were distinct for individual plants, among plants within a field trial, and also in different field trials. Although the reasons for these differences are not yet known, a number of factors likely influence the diversity of bacteria in the phyllosphere including colonization patterns as plants emerge from the soil, insects, or weather conditions.</p>
			<p>Remarkably, even with the significant inter-plant variation among bacteria on lettuce, the microbiota could be distinguished on the basis of the time of year when the plants were collected. This finding is the first time seasonal effects on the diversity of phyllosphere microbiota have been characterized for an annual plant grown in a single location. Phyllosphere communities have previously been shown to differ according to season on cottonwood (<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><named-content content-type="genus" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Populus</italic></named-content><italic> <named-content content-type="species" xlink:type="simple">deltoids</named-content></italic></named-content>) and magnolia (<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><named-content content-type="genus" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Magnolia</italic></named-content><italic> <named-content content-type="species" xlink:type="simple">grandiflora</named-content></italic></named-content>) trees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] as well as for bacterial communities in soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>] and air [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Seasonal effects were also proposed for the phyllosphere of Romaine lettuce, yet because different geographical locations (California and Arizona) were surveyed, it was not possible to ascertain whether these were season or location-dependent differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Although there are likely geographical effects on the phyllosphere microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>], our results underscore the natural variation in the microbial composition on plants at one site within and between plantings.</p>
			<p>Another factor common among the field trials was the increase in diversity and change in composition of the bacteria on lettuce between 7 to 21 dpi. Microbial succession has been reported to occur in the phyllosphere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>], however, to fully address questions of microbial succession compared with daily and seasonal variations, future studies should aim at studying the bacterial diversity on plants collected at different stages of maturity on the same day in a single geographical location.</p>
			<p>Upon limiting our comparisons to plants collected on the same date in each field trial, differences were found between the microbiota exposed to drip or sprinkler irrigation. Colony assessments indicated that there were typically more bacterial cells on plants that were sprinkler-irrigated possibly due to the higher availability of free water on those plants. Similarly, the microbial diversity was also influenced by irrigation method for the majority of plant sampling dates. Although bacteria in the water or in soil-splash might have also contributed to the alteration of the microbiota on the sprinkler-irrigated plants, this possibility is not supported by prior work which concluded that the source of irrigation water was not significantly linked to the microbial diversity in the phyllosphere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and the lack of evidence for an increased presence of typical soil-associated bacteria among our sequencing results on sprinkler-irrigated plants.</p>
			<p>The inoculation of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7 also resulted in minor, but lasting effects on the composition of the lettuce microbiota. Because few studies have aimed to investigate the effects of a bacterial inoculant on existing bacterial populations on plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>], it is currently not known whether the observed differences in the bacterial diversity were due specifically to the strain of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7 used in this study or the result of a more general effect that might also apply to other inoculants such as biocontrol agents.</p>
			<p>Most notably, microbial community differences were found when inoculated plants were grouped according to the presence/absence of viable <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7 cells (InocPOS/InocNEG). Bacterial abundance measured by enumeration on TSA and by real-time PCR indicated that, on average, the total number of cells was lower on plants that contained very low but persistent quantities of viable <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7. This finding indicates that under pre-harvest conditions, plants harboring reduced numbers of epiphytes might be more likely to support contaminants such as human pathogens. However, the total number of cells likely only partially explains the differences between plants with and without persistent <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7. PCoA plots indicated that the bacterial diversity among epiphytic populations was distinct between InocNEG and InocPOS plants. Thus, it appears that certain bacterial species or microbial consortia in the phyllosphere might contribute to the differential persistence of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7 on plants in the field. This result is in agreement with previous studies examining <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7 interactions with individual bacterial strains on growth-chamber grown lettuce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. Although the specific organisms responsible for these effects in the field are not yet known, we found evidence that the presence of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Erwinia</italic></named-content> might be correlated with a decrease in the ability of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7 to survive on plants. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Erwinia</italic></named-content>, like <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic>, is a member of the <named-content content-type="domain" xlink:type="simple">Enterobacteriaceae</named-content> and, as shown previously for other closely related epiphytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], these bacteria might compete with the pathogen for the nutritional resources available on the leaf surface. However, because of the significant variability in the composition of the phyllosphere microbiota, it remains to be determined whether species of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Erwinia</italic></named-content> can directly influence <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7 survival.</p>
			<p>We applied high-throughput DNA sequencing to identify and characterize the bacteria on lettuce exposed to biotic and abiotic treatments in a single field over time. The approach is aligned with large-scale projects such as the Earth Microbiome Project (http://www.earthmicrobiome.org) that aim to identify and compare microorganisms in the environment with extensive metadata [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. The increasing number of outbreaks of foodborne illness due to human pathogen contamination of leafy-green produce has heightened the need for such studies for the specific purpose of improving microbial food safety. Additionally, fundamental information was gained on how bacterial communities develop and the resiliency of those communities against disturbance. Our findings showed that <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7 altered the microbial communities on plants, and conversely, the microbiota were distinct on most plants that harbored viable <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content></italic> O157:H7 cells long after inoculation. The results of this work might eventually be useful in developing risk-assessment tools to predict pathogen contamination and for new control strategies designed to improve microbial food safety and defense.</p>
