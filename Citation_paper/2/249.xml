<abstract>
<p>Within the circulation, cholesterol is transported by lipoprotein particles and is taken up by cells when these particles associate with cellular receptors. In macrophages, excessive lipoprotein particle uptake leads to foam cell formation, which is an early event in the development of atherosclerosis. Currently, mechanisms responsible for foam cell formation are incompletely understood. To date, several macrophage receptors have been identified that contribute to the uptake of modified forms of lipoproteins leading to foam cell formation, but the contribution of the LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) to this process is not known. To investigate the role of LRP1 in cholesterol accumulation in macrophages, we generated mice with a selective deletion of LRP1 in macrophages on an LDL receptor (LDLR)-deficient background (macLRP1-/-). After feeding mice a high fat diet for 11 weeks, peritoneal macrophages isolated from <italic>Lrp</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice contained significantly higher levels of total cholesterol than those from macLRP1-/- mice. Further analysis revealed that this was due to increased levels of cholesterol esters. Interestingly, macLRP1-/- mice displayed elevated plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels resulting from accumulation of large, triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles in the circulation. This increase did not result from an increase in hepatic VLDL biosynthesis, but rather results from a defect in catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles in macLRP1-/- mice. These studies reveal an important <italic>in vivo</italic> contribution of macrophage LRP1 to cholesterol homeostasis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Key events during the development of atherosclerosis include the accumulation of lipoprotein particles in the subendothelial arterial intima, where they are taken up by recruited monocytes/macrophages [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This process occurs via interaction of cholesterol ester-rich lipoprotein particles with specific macrophage receptors that target the internalized lipoproteins to lysosomes. Here the lipoprotein particles are processed and the cholesterol esters are hydrolyzed to free cholesterol [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In cells, excess free cholesterol is subsequently re-esterified and stored in the cytoplasm as lipid droplets, which under conditions of excessive uptake results in the morphologic appearance known as foam cells [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
<p>There is considerable interest in identifying macrophage receptors that participate in the internalization of lipoprotein particles leading to cholesterol accumulation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Early studies confirmed that native forms of LDL particles are not taken up by macrophages and therefore do not contribute to excessive cholesterol uptake in these cells [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It was subsequently discovered that modified forms of LDL are internalized by macrophages leading to unregulated cholesterol uptake [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Further investigation revealed that macrophages express a number of scavenger receptors that recognize oxidized forms of LDL. Cell based studies have identified two members of this receptor family, SR-A (<italic>Msr1</italic>) and CD36 (<italic>Cd36</italic>) that can mediate the cellular internalization of oxidized LDL leading to cholesterol ester accumulation and foam cell formation [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Peritoneal macrophages isolated from <italic>Cd36</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, <italic>apoE</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> double knockout mice or <italic>Msr1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, <italic>apoE</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> double knockout mice on a high fat diet show a marked reduction in free and esterified cholesterol [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] confirming the <italic>in vivo</italic> importance of these receptors in cholesterol accumulation. However, targeted deletion of both SR-A and CD36 on an apoE-deficient background does not abrogate macrophage foam cell formation, revealing that other mechanisms exist in macrophages that contribute to lipid uptake [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. More recently, the lectin-type oxidized LDL receptor (LOX1) has been identified in endothelial cells as well as macrophages [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] which binds oxidized forms of LDL, and enhances the development of atherogenesis in LDL receptor-deficient mice [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Certain modifications of LDL, such as incubation with secreted sphingomyelinase, results in aggregation of the LDL particles which leads to enhanced macrophage uptake and cholesterol loading in these cells [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Various mechanisms have been suggested for the internalization of aggregated LDL particles by macrophages [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], including receptor-mediated uptake by the LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. LRP1 is a large endocytic receptor that was originally identified when Herz et al. [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] cloned a large protein containing multiple LDLa repeats and when Ashcom et al. [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and Moestrup et al. [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] isolated and sequenced the liver receptor responsible for catabolism of α<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin (α<sub>2</sub>M)-proteinase complexes [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition to its ability to bind α<sub>2</sub>M-proteinase complexes, early cross-linking studies revealed that LRP1 can also bind apolipoprotein E-containing liposomes [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] suggesting that LRP1 might also function as a receptor for chylomicron and VLDL remnants rich in apoE. This was confirmed in studies revealing that genetic deletion of hepatic LRP1 in LDL receptor-deficient mice resulted in a substantial increase in remnant accumulation in the plasma [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
<p>LRP1 is abundant in several cells, including macrophages. Prior work has revealed that mice with a selective deletion of LRP1 in macrophages have more extensive atherosclerosis when crossed into an apoE/LDL receptor double knockout mouse [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] or when bone marrow from LRP1-/- mice are transplanted into irradiated LDL receptor-deficient mice [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Additionally, genetic deletion of LRP1 in macrophages also results in more extensive vascular remodeling upon injury [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The mechanisms by which macrophage LRP1 modulates the development of atherosclerosis and the extent of vascular remodeling are not fully understood at this time, but may involve LRP1’s ability to regulate the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], its ability to regulate the TGF-β signaling pathway [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], or its ability to modulate macrophage migration by coordinating with the integrin Mac-1, tissue-type plasminogen activator and its serpin inhibitor, PAI-1 [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The current studies were undertaken to determine the contribution of macrophage LRP1 to cholesterol homeostasis and foam cell formation by employing mice with tissue-selective deletion of the <italic>Lrp1</italic> gene in macrophages. The results reveal an important contribution of macrophage LRP1 to cholesterol uptake in macrophages.</p>

<p>Anti-LRP1 R2629 has been described [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Anti-apoE antibodies were purchased from AbCam. Rabbit polyclonal anti-apoC3 was obtained from Santa Cruz, while anti-Mac-2 IgG was purchased from Cedarlane laboratories. For immunoblotting, cell extracts were prepared as described [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. 30 μg of protein from each lysate was resolved by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions on 4–12% Tris-glycine SDS gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and membranes were blocked with 3% milk in Tris-buffered saline for 1 hour. Membranes were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with the indicated antibody at 1 μg/ml in Tris-buffered saline with 3% milk and 0.05% Tween 20. Membranes were washed, incubated with HRP-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:10,000) and then washed and developed with ECL Reagents (Pierce), or by incubation with an appropriate IRDye (LI-COR Biosciences) conjugated secondary antibody.

<title>Lipoprotein analysis</title>
<p>Blood samples were drawn from mice following fasting by retro-orbital sinus bleeds. Serum was assayed for total cholesterol (Cholesterol E kit, Wako Diagnostics) and total triglycerides (Sigma) using commercially available spectrophotometric kits. Lipoproteins from pooled serum were separated on a Superose 6 FPLC column run at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. 100 μl of serum was loaded on the column and 0.5 ml fractions were collected. The cholesterol and triglyceride content of each fraction was determined as above. Plasma lipoproteins from LRP1+/+ and macLRP1-/- mice fed the aforementioned Western diet for 3 weeks were isolated by sequential floatation ultracentrifugation as described [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Briefly, blood from retro-orbital sinus bleeds was collected in EDTA-containing tubes (final concentration 4 mM) and plasma was separated by low speed centrifugation at 4°C. Samples of plasma from two LRP1+/+ and two macLRP1-/- mice were pooled. After the plasma was adjusted to a density of 1.019 g/ml with NaBr, aliquots of 1 ml were transferred to the bottoms of centrifuge tubes. Each was overlaid with 4 ml of a NaBr solution of density 1.019 g/ml. Following 20 h of ultracentrifugation in a SW 55TI rotor (Beckman) at 34,000 rpm and at 16°C, 0.5 ml fractions were collected from the top of the tubes (labeled VLDL fraction). Protein content of these fractions was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). For SDS-PAGE analysis, 15 μg was separated on a 4–20% Tris-glycine gel under reducing conditions and stained with Coomassie blue. To measure the apoC3 content of the VLDL fraction, acetone precipitation was performed by adding 1 volume (40 μg of protein) to 4 volumes of ice cold acetone and incubating for 2 h at -20°C. All samples were centrifuged, and the pellets were dissolved in SDS reducing buffer and resolved on a 4–20% Tris-glycine gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and membranes were blocked with 3% milk in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C with either rabbit polyclonal anti-apoC3 (1 μg/ml in TBS with 3% milk and 0.05% Tween 20) or rabbit polyclonal anti-apoE (1 μg/ml in TBS with 3% milk and 0.05% Tween 20). Immunoreactive bands were detected and analyzed as described above.</p>
<p>For the gavage experiments, 13 week old male mice who had been fed standard chow diet were fasted before olive oil gavage (10 ml/kg; Sigma-Aldrich) [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Blood samples were obtained by tail snipping at the indicated times. Serum was analyzed with Serum TG Determination Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.</p>

<p>Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages (2x10<sup>6</sup> cells) isolated from macLRP1-/- and LRP1+/+ mice were plated in 100 mm dishes in serum free media for 3 h at 37°C. Cells were scraped off the plate into 4 ml PBS and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. Cell pellets were extracted with 300 μl isopropanol with sonication (2 x 10 s, medium setting). The cell extract was centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 5 min and the supernatant was removed and assayed for cholesterol. Total cholesterol and free cholesterol was determined using the Invitrogen Amplex Red Cholesterol Assay in the presence or absence of cholesterol esterase respectively.

<title>Cholesterol efflux assay</title>
<p>Cholesterol efflux assays were carried out essentially as described [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 3 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well overnight in Macrophage Growth Medium (MGM; DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 10% L-929 conditioned medium). Non-adherent cells were removed, and adherent cells were washed twice with PBS and cultured in MGM. The cells were incubated with 50 μg/mL oxidized LDL (Alfa Aesar) and 1 μCi/mL [1,2-<sup>3</sup>H(N)]-cholesterol (PerkinElmer) in MGM for 24 hours at 37°C. Following incubation, the cells were washed twice with PBS, incubated in low serum growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin), and treated with or without 8-Br-cyclic AMP (Sigma) for 16–18 hours. To induce efflux, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in DMEM containing 50 μg/mL HDL (Intracel). At the indicated time points, the medium was collected and centrifuged at maximum speed for 10 minutes and cells were harvested by addition of NP-40 lysis buffer. Radioactivity in the medium and cell lysate was quantified by liquid scintillation counting, and percent cholesterol efflux was calculated as follows: (cpm<sub>Media</sub>/(cpm<sub>Media</sub> + cpm<sub>Cell</sub>)) x 100 after subtracting background efflux (efflux in the absence of HDL).</p>

<p>Resident liver macrophages, known as Kupffer cells, also express LRP1. To evaluate Kupffer cell LRP1 expression in LRP1+/+ and macLRP1-/- mice, immunohistochemistry was performed on sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded livers from mice fed a Western diet for four weeks. Tissues were co-stained for LRP1 and the Kupffer cell marker, Mac-2, using an Alexa 546-conjugated rabbit polyclonal anti-LRP1 IgG, and an Alexa 488-labeled rat monoclonal anti-Mac 2 antibody.

As anticipated, the results confirm that resident macrophages are depleted of LRP1 in macLRP1-/- mice. To ensure that hepatic LRP1 function was normal in these mice, we examined the clearance of <sup>125</sup>I-labeled α<sub>2</sub>M* in LRP1+/+ and macLRP1-/- mice.

<title>LRP1-deficient macrophages are defective in internalizing aggregated LDL</title>
<p>To define potential mechanisms by which macrophage LRP1 mediates the uptake of lipoprotein particles, we examined the ability of peritoneal macrophages to mediate the uptake of cholesterol derived from lipoproteins. Initial experiments were performed in which LRP1-expressing or LRP1-deficient macrophages were cultured in the presence of delipidated serum or delipidated serum containing LDL, oxidized LDL, VLDL, or chylomicrons. After 3 days, the cholesterol content of the macrophages was quantified (<xref rid="pone.0128903.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref>).

Thus, we examined cholesterol efflux from peritoneal macrophages isolated from LRP1+/+ and macLRP1-/- mice.

As shown in <xref rid="pone.0128903.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3f</xref>, cAMP stimulated cholesterol efflux in both LRP1+/+ and macLRP1-/- macrophages, with no differences noted between them.

We found no significant difference in lipase activity from any of the organs examined between LRP1+/+ and macLRP1-/- mice (Fig <xref rid="pone.0128903.g008" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0128903.g008" ref-type="fig">8d</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results obtained in the current investigation document an important <italic>in vivo</italic> role for LRP1 in mediating cholesterol uptake in macrophages. This was confirmed by demonstrating that macLRP1-/- mice have a significant decrease in macrophage cholesterol content when fed a Western diet. Further, we noted elevated plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels in macLRP1-/- mice. Together, these data provide compelling <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that LRP1 contributes to cholesterol accumulation in macrophages. Interestingly, CD36 and SR-A, two receptors implicated in macrophage cholesterol uptake, also show elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels when <italic>Cd36</italic>-/- and <italic>Msr1</italic>-/- mice on an apoE null background are fed a Western diet [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Thus, it is evident that multiple pathways contribute to cholesterol accumulation in macrophages.</p>
<p>The role of LRP1 in chylomicron remnant catabolism is well established [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], although the involvement of this receptor in this process has been questioned since the contribution of LRP1 to chylomicron remnant uptake is only observed upon LDL receptor deficiency [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. However, it should be noted that chylomicron remnant particles only accumulate in the circulation when <italic>both</italic> the LDL receptor and LRP1 are deleted in the liver. Thus genetic deletion of either hepatic LRP1 alone [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] or the LDL receptor alone [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] does not lead to accumulation of remnant lipoproteins. These results are consistent with the notion that both receptors contribute to remnant lipoprotein clearance, and when one is absent or defective, the other compensates. Remnant clearance by the liver is a complex process and requires the participation of heparin sulfate proteoglycans, such as syndecan-1 [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Further, current models suggest that uptake of remnant lipoproteins by LRP1 requires enrichment of the particle with apoE [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], and studies in LDL receptor as well as apoE-deficient mice suggest that the source of this apoE is the liver [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p>
<p>In contrast to the hepatic uptake of lipoproteins, the mechanisms by which macrophages take up lipoprotein particles are not as well understood. Macrophage scavenger receptors have been identified that participate in the uptake and internalization of modified forms of LDL [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], and both SR-A (<italic>Msr1</italic>) and CD36 (<italic>Cd36</italic>) have been implicated in this process [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Despite convincing reports that these two receptors contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and macrophage foam cell formation [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], abundant foam cell macrophages were detected in atherosclerotic lesions of mice containing genetic deletions of both receptors [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] revealing that other pathways exist for excessive lipid uptake by macrophages. Our studies suggest that LRP1 also contributes to this process. Several other mechanisms have been proposed that may also contribute to macrophage foam cell formation. For example, Kruth and colleagues have found that LDL can be internalized in macrophages by macropinocytosis [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], and have proposed this as another pathway for macrophage foam cell formation. A response-to-retention hypothesis has also been proposed in which intramural accumulation of lipoproteins and lipoprotein microaggregates represent an important early event in atherosclerosis that leads to modifications of the lipoproteins with important biological consequences including foam cell formation [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p>
<p>The findings of elevated triglyceride-rich lipoprotein levels in the plasma of macLRP1-/- mice fed a Western diet are somewhat suprising since our results differ from ealier work on macLRP1-/- mice. For example, Hu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] generated macLRP1-/- mice on an apoE/LDLR double-deficient background and did not detect any differences in plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels in their studies when fed a Western diet. It is likely that the absence of apoE expression in their mice accounts for the differences with those of the current study, since LRP1 requires apoE for recognition of VLDL and chylomicron remnant particles [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Overton et al. [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] also conducted a study in which bone marrow from macLRP1-/- mice was transplanted into lethally irradiated female LDLR-/- recipient mice. Similar to the Hu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] study, Overton et al. [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] noted no difference in plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels. The difference between their results and those in the present study likely arise from the fact that <italic>in vivo</italic> replacement of resident macrophages, such as Kupffer cells, upon bone marrow transplantation is a relatively slow process taking several months [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p>
<p>The mechanism by which macrophage LRP1 influences the levels of plasma triglyceride-rich lipoproteins is not clear at this time, but several possibilities exist. First, macrophages may play a direct role in the clearance of remnant lipoproteins. In this regard, it is interesting to highlight the studies of Hussain et al. [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] who demonstrated that signficant amounts of injected labeled chylomicrons were cleared by perisinusoidal bone marrow macrophages identifying an important contribution of macrophages to chylomicron remnant catabolism. Interestingly, hepatic deletion of LRP1 on an LDL receptor-deficient background does not require feeding a Western diet to prompt accumulation of remnant lipoproteins in the plasma [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], whereas macLRP1-/- mice have to be challenged with an atherogenic diet in order to display elevated remnant lipoproteins. Together, these data would suggest that macrophage LRP1 only plays a critical role in remnant clearance when other tissues are overwhelmed. Secondly, it is possible that the Western diet triggers an LRP1-mediated inflammatory response that signals other tissues to alter their usual role in lipoprotein homeostasis. In this regard, it is interesting to highlight that Kupffer cells are the primary source of hepatic pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic cytokines [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], and accumulation of cholesterol in Kupffer cells results in their activation and conversion to a pro-inflammatory phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. LRP1 expressed in Kupffer cells may regulate signaling pathways that in turn could alter lipoprotein catabolism. Additional studies are required to determine if this is the case.</p>
<p>Despite the increased cholesterol content of LRP1-expressing macrophages, studies have revealed that macrophage LRP1 protects the vasculature from the development of atherosclerosis [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and from excessive remodeling upon injury [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The fact that excessive cholesterol accumulation in LRP1-expressing macrophages does not exacerbate the development of atherosclerosis likely results from the multifunctional nature of LRP1, which binds over 30 distinct ligands and influences numerous signaling pathways. While the exact mechanisms by which macrophage LRP1 modulates atherosclerosis and vascular remodeling are not fully understood, several possibilities exist. First, in the vasculature, LRP1 regulates the TGF-β signaling pathway by suppressing TGF-β2 gene expression and regulates TGF-β2 protein levels by binding and removing this ligand upon endocytosis [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], which may influence the progression of atherosclerosis. Second, interesting studies have found that LRP1 suppresses macrophage inflammatory response to LPS treatment [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] by a mechanism involving proteolysis of the LRP1 ectodomain followed by γ-secretase-dependent release of the LRP1 intracellular domain (ICD). This domain interacts with interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) resulting in enhanced nuclear export and degradation of this transcription factor thereby reducing expression of IRF-3 target genes. By suppressing the inflammatory response of macrophages, LRP1 could also influence the development of atherosclerosis. Third, LRP1 also modulates a number of signaling pathways, including the PDGF-signaling pathway [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], as well as the Wnt-signaling pathway [<xref rid="pone.0128903.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], both of which impact the development of atherosclerosis. Together, all of these studies highlight the potential of LRP1 to modulate a variety of signaling pathways with the outcome highly dependent upon the initiating stimulus and cellular context.</p>
<p>In summary, the current investigation has confirmed an important <italic>in vivo</italic> role for macrophages and macrophage LRP1 in modulating cholesterol metabolism. The data further reveal that LRP1 is one of the major receptors that contribute to lipoprotein uptake in macrophages leading to foam cell formation. It is well known that the development of atherosclerosis is a complex process involving multiple genes, and defining the potential of LRP1 to regulate these processes may assist in identifying molecules which could have significant therapeutic potential.</p>
