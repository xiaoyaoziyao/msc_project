<abstract>
<p>The MYC oncoprotein regulates transcription of a large fraction of the genome as an obligatory heterodimer with the transcription factor MAX. The MYC:MAX heterodimer and MAX:MAX homodimer (hereafter MYC/MAX) bind Enhancer box (E-box) DNA elements (CANNTG) and have the greatest affinity for the canonical MYC E-box (CME) CACGTG. However, MYC:MAX also recognizes E-box variants and was reported to bind DNA in a “non-specific” fashion <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Here, in order to identify potential additional non-canonical binding sites for MYC/MAX, we employed high throughput <italic>in vitro</italic> protein-binding microarrays, along with electrophoretic mobility-shift assays and bioinformatic analyses of MYC-bound genomic loci <italic>in vivo</italic>. We identified all hexameric motifs preferentially bound by MYC/MAX <italic>in vitro</italic>, which include the low-affinity non-E-box sequence AACGTT, and found that the vast majority (87%) of MYC-bound genomic sites in a human B cell line contain at least one of the top 21 motifs bound by MYC:MAX <italic>in vitro</italic>. We further show that high MYC/MAX concentrations are needed for specific binding to the low-affinity sequence AACGTT <italic>in vitro</italic> and that elevated MYC levels <italic>in vivo</italic> more markedly increase the occupancy of AACGTT sites relative to CME sites, especially at distal intergenic and intragenic loci. Hence, MYC binds diverse DNA motifs with a broad range of affinities in a sequence-specific and dose-dependent manner, suggesting that MYC overexpression has more selective effects on the tumor transcriptome than previously thought.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The oncoprotein MYC is an essential DNA-binding transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLHZ) family that regulates transcription of a large number of genes in metazoans and controls cell cycle, cell growth, metabolism, cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and cell transformation and is overexpressed in many types of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref002">2</xref>]. MYC binds DNA as a heterodimer with an obligatory bHLHZ partner called MAX. In contrast to MYC, the MAX protein can also homodimerize. The MYC:MAX heterodimer and MAX:MAX homodimer recognize Enhancer box (E-box) DNA elements (CANNTG) and have the highest affinity for the palindromic E-box sequence CACGTG, referred to hereafter as the canonical MYC E-box (CME) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref009">9</xref>]. Heterodimerization with MAX is essential for most MYC biological functions, including transcription regulation and cell transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref011">11</xref>]. In contrast MAX:MAX homodimers do not have a transcription regulatory domain and interfere with MYC:MAX functions via recognition of the same E-box motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Crystal structures of the bHLHZ domains of MYC:MAX and MAX:MAX complexes (referred to as MYC/MAX complexes hereafter) bound to a CME-containing oligonucleotide showed that three conserved amino acids within the basic region of MYC and MAX make identical contacts with four specific bases located symmetrically on either arm of the palindromic CME sequence <underline>CA</underline>C<underline>G</underline>T<underline>G</underline> (base contacts underlined for only one strand) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref015">15</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic> binding site selection studies showed that MYC/MAX complexes can also bind non-canonical motifs, albeit with reduced affinities, including the E-box sequence CA<underline>T</underline>GTG and several E-box variants such as CACG<underline>C</underline>G, CACG<underline>A</underline>G, CA<underline>T</underline>G<underline>C</underline>G, and CACGT<underline>T</underline> (non canonical base underlined) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) in mammalian cells confirmed that the CME (CACGTG) is the most significantly enriched sequence at MYC-bound loci <italic>in vivo</italic> followed by the variant sequences CACG<underline>C</underline>G, CA<underline>T</underline>G<underline>C</underline>G, CACG<underline>A</underline>G, and CA<underline>T</underline>GTG previously identified <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref019">19</xref>]. Both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies also indicated that MYC/MAX affinity for core E-box elements is influenced by nucleotides immediately flanking the core hexamer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref017">17</xref>]. ChIP-seq analyses further revealed that MYC often co-localizes with CpG islands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref020">20</xref>]; in the genome of mouse fibroblasts, for example, about half of MYC-bound sites occur within 1 kb of a transcription start site (TSS), a majority (~75%) of which are CpG islands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref017">17</xref>]. The genomic occupancy of MYC:MAX has also been shown to correlate with an active/open chromatin conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref022">22</xref>] and with the occupancy of the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref023">23</xref>]. This is consistent with not only the known interactions between MYC and the RNAPII machinery, other DNA-binding regulators and chromatin-modifying coregulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref026">26</xref>], but also with the observation that MYC stimulates the release of pre-engaged and paused RNAPII at many promoters in embryonic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref027">27</xref>]. More recently, it was noted that under certain <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions MYC:MAX complexes display non-specific DNA-binding activity and that MYC binding to chromatin <italic>in vivo</italic> does not generally correlate with the presence of high affinity motifs, including the top 12 motifs identified <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref023">23</xref>]. This led to the proposal that MYC genomic occupancy is largely independent of sequence specificity and that MYC:MAX complexes are primarily recruited by other chromatin-associated factors and/or epigenetic marks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref028">28</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, in order to address the issue of nonspecific DNA binding by MYC/MAX, we used recombinant MYC/MAX complexes in a protein-binding microarray (PBM) approach with which we could examine binding to 5000 unique DNA sequences, without interference of other host factors. We show that MYC/MAX complexes bind in a sequence-specific manner to not only high-affinity E-boxes and close variants but also to more degenerate and lower affinity non-E-box DNA sequences, such as the palindromic hexamer AACGTT, which we confirmed by electrophoretic mobility-shift assays (EMSAs). Bioinformatic analyses of published ChIP-seq datasets indicated that the vast majority (87%) of MYC-occupied genomic loci in human cells contained at least one of the top 21 MYC-bound motifs identified in the PBM, including the low-affinity AACGTT hexamer. Furthermore, we found differential effects of MYC expression levels on binding to high-affinity CME versus low-affinity non-E-box AACGTT motifs as well as promoter versus distal regions. In addition, the top biological processes preferentially regulated via MYC-bound CME genes (e.g., ribosome biogenesis, metabolic processes) are not enriched for in genes with MYC-associated AACGTT motifs. Hence, we propose that low-affinity binding sites could play an important role in conveying specific MYC functions under conditions of overexpression, which occur during transformation to a cancerous state.</p>

<p>Protein binding microarrays (PBMs) were carried out essentially as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref030">30</xref>] except that purified recombinant MYC/MAX proteins complexes were used. A custom-designed array was ordered from Agilent and contained 15,000 spots of single-stranded DNA probes with ~5000 unique DNA sequences each spotted in triplicate as 12-nucleotide test sequences and attached to a glass slide (designed as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The variable 12-nucleotide sequence was located between the linker (<monospace>5’- CGTCGATATAGTAATCTTAGCTATTAA-3’</monospace>) and the cap (<monospace>5’-GCCGG-3’</monospace>). All the unique DNA sequences of the array are provided in supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0180147.s011">S1 Table</xref>. The DNA probes were made into double-stranded duplexes using a primer to a common linker sequence, dNTPs (GE Healthcare) and Thermo Sequenase (Affymetrix, Cat# 78500). The slides were subsequently blocked for 90 min with 2% non-fat milk in PBS plus 0.01% Tween 20, washed three times (all washes were done with PBS plus 0.01% Tween 20 unless otherwise specified) and then incubated with 550 ng MAX:MAX or MYC:MAX complexes in binding buffer (15 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 0.075% NP40, 7.5 mM beta-mercatoethanol, 375 ng/μl BSA and 8 ng/μl poly(dA–dT):(dA–dT) for 60 min. After three washes the slides were incubated overnight with a primary antibody to MAX diluted 1:200 (rabbit anti-MAX C-17X, Santa Cruz), washed three times and then incubated with donkey anti-rabbit Dylight 549 (Jackson ImmunResearch) at 1:50 dilution for 60 min. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 2% milk plus 0.01% Tween20. All reactions were carried out at room temperature. After washing three times, plus a final wash in PBS, the slide was dried and scanned at 543 nm using a GenePix Axon 4000B scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at the UCR Genomics Core Facility. Extraction and normalization of the data were as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref030">30</xref>].

<p>Complementary pairs of oligonucleotides consisting of the Consensus MYC E-box (CME), Non-E-box (NE), derivative sequence variants, and Control (Ctrl.) sequences were purchased from Eurofins Genomics, annealed and labeled by Klenow filling with [α-32P]dGTP to a specific activity of ~4 × 10<sup>5</sup> cpm/pmol. DNA-binding with recombinant MYC/MAX complexes were performed in 10-μl reactions containing 0.5 pmol labeled probe, 80 ng poly(dA–dT):(dA–dT), 375 ng/μl BSA, 15 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.9), 100 mM KCl, 15% glycerol, 0.15 mM EDTA, 0.075% NP-40, and 7.5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, essentially as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref029">29</xref>].

<title>Analysis of ChIP-seq data</title>
<p>For peak finding, ChIP-seq reads were aligned to the UCSC human genome (hg19) using Bowtie for Illumina. Unmapped reads were removed and the SAM files were converted to BAM files. The BAM files were transferred to a Galaxy server dedicated to ChIP-seq analysis, Cistrome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cistrome.org" xlink:type="simple">http://cistrome.org</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref035">35</xref>]. MYC peaks were called using the MACS software version 2. Only significant peaks with P values below 1e-08 were recognized. MACs peaks were ranked by fold enrichment and sorted into three subsets: “Low”, “Medium” and “High” enriched regions. The apex of each MYC peak was expanded by +/-100 base pairs to obtain MYC summits.</p>
<p>For motif enrichment and annotation, the genomic locations of all E-boxes, the Non-E-box (AACGTT) and control sequences were determined using the HOMER (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://homer.salk.edu" xlink:type="simple">http://homer.salk.edu</ext-link>) motif discovery software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref036">36</xref>]. The normalized frequencies of motifs in MYC peaks and summits were obtained by intersecting the genomic positions of ChIP-seq peaks/summits and motifs, and then normalizing to the occurrence of each motif in the genome. Homer’s peak annotation program was used to associate MYC peaks and summits with nearby genes and to identify peaks in the promoter (+/- 2 kb of TSS), intergenic, or intragenic regions of a genomic feature. Homer’s peak annotation tool was also used to determine the spatial distribution of the CME and NE motifs in MYC summits (+/-100bp) and summits extended by 250bp on either side (total region +/-350bp).</p>

<title>Identification of DNA sequence motifs preferentially bound by MYC/MAX complexes <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>In order to identify in an unbiased manner the DNA sequences preferentially bound by MYC/MAX complexes, we designed a protein binding microarray (PBM) that contained ~5000 different DNA probes (all in triplicate) and included all possible 6-mer motifs (tgaNNNNNNgta, 4096 total; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In addition, the PBM contained 128 probes with all 3-mer substitutions in either the left or the right flank of the CME core (nnnCACGTGgta and tgaCACGTGnnn) and 518 random substitutions of the 12-mer CME motif tgaCACGTGgta (minimum of three and maximum of six substitutions within a given 12-mer sequence). The PBM also contained 100 random 12-mer probes, which were used to evaluate non-specific binding (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The PBM was incubated with purified recombinant full-length MYC:MAX or MAX:MAX protein complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) and analyzed by immunofluorescence using an anti-MAX antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The MYC:MAX complexes were devoid of any MAX:MAX dimer as determined by EMSA (see below).</p>
<p>Global analysis of the ~5000 DNA sequences on the PBM indicated, as expected, that the binding sequence preferences of MYC:MAX strongly correlate to those of MAX:MAX (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.764, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). When considering only the most significantly bound probes in the PBM (binding scores greater than 95% of the random 12-mer sequences, corresponding to &gt;2 standard deviations from mean random score), we identified 378 probes with 25 different motifs bound by MYC:MAX and 466 probes with 22 different motifs bound by MAX:MAX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g001">Fig 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0180147.s011">S1 Table</xref>). Among these, a total of 14 different 6-mer motifs were common to both MYC:MAX and MAX:MAX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g001">Fig 1E</xref>, double arrows). The top six common MYC/MAX motifs matched the top six motifs identified by Guo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref023">23</xref>] in an independent PBM analysis reported while our study was in progress (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0180147.s011">S1 Table</xref>). Two other MYC-bound motifs identified by Guo et al. in their top-12 list (Guo’s motifs #7 and #10) were also in our list of top binders (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0180147.s011">S1 Table</xref>). As expected, the CME motif CACGTG had the highest binding score for both MYC:MAX and MAX:MAX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Nearly all the remaining top-ranked MYC/MAX motifs were either E-boxes (CANNTG) or variants having at least one half E-box sequence of the type CAC or CAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Notable exceptions were the motifs AACGTT and CGCGTT (asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). These motifs diverge from typical <underline>CA</underline>NN<underline>TG</underline> E-boxes (and from the CME) by two substitutions in both the CA and TG arms that define the palindromic E-box (underlined above), and hence were referred to as “non-E-box” sequences hereafter. In addition, the low complexity G/C-rich motifs AGGGGG, AGCGGG, AGGGGC, and CGGGGG (italics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g001">Fig 1E</xref>) were also found in top-ranked probes bound by MYC:MAX. However, these motifs were not bound by MAX:MAX and, therefore, were not investigated further (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec013">Discussion</xref>). Using a less stringent binding threshold (binding scores greater than 80% of random sequences) the non-E-box palindromic sequence AACGTT and all other motifs indicated in bold in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g001">Fig 1E</xref> (a total of 27 top-ranked motifs) were bound by both MYC:MAX and MAX:MAX. These represent high-confidence MYC/MAX motifs.</p>
<p>We further selectively analyzed the 4096 probes having every 6-mer motif flanked by identical nucleotides (i.e., tgaNNNNNNgta) and found ~360 probes specifically bound by MAX:MAX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) and MYC:MAX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) (with scores higher than 80% of random sequences). These probes contained most of the top 6-mer motifs for MYC:MAX and MAX:MAX identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g001">Fig 1E</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0180147.s011">S1 Table</xref>), and included the 27 motifs bound by both MYC:MAX and MAX:MAX (shown in bold in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). As expected, the motifs of the top 50 bound probes were generally close variants of the canonical CME sequence CACGTG for both MAX:MAX and MYC:MAX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>; logos 1–50). MYC:MAX also bound the low complexity G/C-rich sequence CCCCCT (or AGGGGG) and variants thereof (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g002">Fig 2B</xref>; logos 1–50). The next 50 probes with intermediate scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>; logos 51–100) had more degenerate motifs but often retained one half E-box and a central CG or TG (e.g., CACGNN or CATGNN). The remaining 150 probes with the lowest binding scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>, logos 101–350) had highly degenerate motifs that often had the first C replaced by A, but maintained the central CG or TG dinucleotides (e.g., CACGNN, CATGNN, or AACGNN). Notably, this analysis also identified the palindromic sequence AACGTT as a new non-E-box motif bound by both MYC:MAX and MAX:MAX complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>, left panels).</p>

<p>The PBM data further indicated that in the context of the CME motif CACGTG there was a moderate influence of the flanking nucleotides, with possible differential effects on MYC:MAX and MAX:MAX (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0180147.s001">S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0180147.s004">S4</xref> Figs). For instance, the top 25% of CME motifs most avidly bound by MAX:MAX were enriched in flanking sequences with a T or G at position n<sup>1</sup> of the 12-mer n<sup>1</sup>n<sup>2</sup>n<sup>3</sup>CACGTGgta, while MYC:MAX-bound motifs often had an A at position n<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0180147.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0180147.s003">S3</xref> Figs). However, both MYC:MAX and MAX:MAX complexes bound poorly to sequences with an A at position n<sup>10</sup> of the 12-mer tgaCACGTGn<sup>10</sup>n<sup>11</sup>n<sup>12</sup>, as those sequences were most often found in the group of bound probes with the lowest binding scores (bottom 25%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0180147.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Further analysis of bound probes having three to six random substitutions of the 12-mer tgaCACGTGgta also suggested distinct sequence preferences between MYC:MAX and MAX:MAX (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0180147.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). The significance of this differential binding is as of yet unclear, but merits further investigation.

<title>Sequence-specific binding of MYC/MAX to the non-E-box motif AACGTT</title>
<p>Recognition of the canonical MYC E-box sequence (CME) by MYC/MAX complexes involves important symmetrical contacts with specific bases (underlined for only the top strand <underline>CA</underline>C<underline>G</underline>T<underline>G</underline>), including at the first and last positions of the core hexamer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref015">15</xref>]. Consequently, it was intriguing to find that the non-E-box (NE) palindromic sequence AACGTT, which has substitutions at both the first and last positions, was specifically bound by MYC/MAX in the PBM. To further verify the specificity of this interaction we used EMSA to analyze the binding of MYC:MAX and MAX:MAX complexes to radiolabeled CME, NE and non-specific DNA (Ctrl) probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Both MYC:MAX and MAX:MAX complexes bound specifically to the CME and NE probes (no binding to the Ctrl probe was observed) but the binding to the NE probe required higher protein concentrations, indicative of a lower affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). To measure the relative affinities of MYC:MAX and MAX:MAX for the CME and NE motifs we performed EMSA competition experiments in which different amounts of cold CME, NE or Ctrl oligonucleotides were co-incubated with the labeled NE probe and MYC/MAX complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Compared to the CME, the NE motif had a significantly lower affinity for MYC:MAX and MAX:MAX (about 20- and 33-fold lower, respectively), while the Ctrl oligo did not compete, as anticipated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g003">Fig 3C</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine which specific nucleotide positions within the NE motif are important, we performed additional EMSA competition experiments with NE variant (NE-V) sequences and MAX:MAX complexes. Substitution of the first and/or last base pair of the NE sequence AACGTT as in NE variants NE-V1 to V3, or inversion of the central CG nucleotides to GC (i.e., AA<underline>GC</underline>TT in NE-V4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) eliminated the competition by the unlabeled oligos indicating that they do not bind MAX:MAX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). In contrast, a substitution at the first position that restored a perfect half E-box (<underline>C</underline>ACGTT, EV-1) increased competition, and hence binding, and served as a positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Interestingly, a substitution of a flanking nucleotide that generated the palindromic sequence CAACGTTG, which resembles an “extended” CME, did not increase the binding affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, NE(C) motif). Finally, the NE had similar binding affinity as several E-box variants that contained one perfect E-box half site CAC/GTG or CAT/ATG (E-V2 to V4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g005">Fig 5</xref>) and are known to be specifically bound by MYC:MAX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref009">9</xref>]. The relative affinities of the motifs analyzed by EMSA (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g006">Fig 6</xref>) were consistent with the binding scores of these sequences in the PBM and identified motifs with “high”, “medium”, and “low” affinity, and several motifs that do not bind MYC/MAX specifically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g006">Fig 6</xref>).</p>

<title>MYC binding to AACGTT-containing genomic loci is highly dependent on increased MYC expression levels</title>
<p>To address whether MYC associates with genomic sites containing the NE sequence AACGTT <italic>in vivo</italic>, we mined previously published MYC ChIP-seq peaks from the human B cell line P493-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref022">22</xref>]. P493-6 cells carry a tetracycline-repressible ectopic MYC transgene allowing for a range of MYC expression; in the absence of tetracycline the cells express high levels of MYC and display a Burkitt lymphoma-like phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref038">38</xref>]. We first compared, in MYC-overexpressing cells, the normalized frequencies (i.e., enrichment) of E-box sequences (CANNTG) and the NE motif AACGTT for all MYC-bound sites (all MYC peaks) or for only the top 33% most significantly bound loci (top 33% MYC peaks, ranked by p-value; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). While the CME was the most enriched sequence in both categories, the NE sequence was also enriched under MYC peaks, and was more frequently found than all other E-boxes, with the exception of CAGCTG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Since MYC ChIP-seq peaks are broad (covering on average ~500 bp), we also examined a more restricted DNA-bound region within 100 bp of the apex (MYC summits), which should contain the primary MYC binding site(s). Within MYC summits, the NE was also more enriched than many E-boxes, but less so than the CME and three other E-boxes, including the sequence CAGCTG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). The latter is intriguing because the CAGCTG sequence was not significantly bound by MYC/MAX in the PBM, consistent with the fact that another class of bHLH proteins (e.g., AP4, E12, E47 and MYOD) recognizes this E-box [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref039">39</xref>], suggesting an indirect binding of MYC to this element <italic>in vivo</italic>.

<title>Normalized Frequencies of E-boxes and of the NE motif AACGTT at MYC-occupied genomic loci in human P493-6 B-cells.</title>
<p>MYC-bound sequences were obtained from ChIP-seq data of P493-6 cells overexpressing MYC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref022">22</xref>]. The frequencies of all ten possible E-boxes (CANNTG), the NE motif AACGTT, and two control (Ctrl) sequences under MYC ChIP-seq peaks <bold>(A)</bold> and summits <bold>(B)</bold> were normalized to the occurrence of each motif in the human genome. The summits are the ±100 bp region from the apex of ChIP-seq peaks. The normalized frequencies are shown for all MYC peaks/summits (left) and for the most significant MYC peaks/summits (top 33% based on p-value; right).</p>

<p>The above analyses indicate that the NE motif AACGTT is found within MYC-bound sequences <italic>in vivo</italic> at a higher normalized frequency (more enriched) than many E-box motifs. Furthermore, for both the MYC peaks and the more restricted MYC summits the vast majority of MYC-bound sequences with NE motifs (801 out of 1132 and 329 out of 390, respectively) did not contain the CME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Altogether these results suggest that the NE might be recognized by overexpressed MYC <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, it should be noted that with the exception of the highest affinity and most enriched CME (CACGTG) the other MYC motifs examined, including medium-affinity/medium-enriched motifs (CATGTG and CACGTT) and the low-affinity E-box (CATATG) and NE (AACGTT) did not generally cluster at the center of ChIP-seq summits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0180147.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). This could suggest that recruitment of MYC to non-CME loci may often involve cooperative interactions with other chromatin-associated factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref040">40</xref>] in addition to sequence-specific binding to low-affinity DNA motifs.</p>

<p>We next characterized the location of different categories of MYC ChIP-seq peaks (all peaks/summits or peaks/summits containing either a CME or NE) relative to annotated genes in MYC-overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g008">Fig 8B and 8C</xref>). The NE-containing MYC peaks and summits were mostly (~55–60%) localized to promoter proximal regions (+/-2 kb from a TSS) with the remaining NE-containing MYC peaks/summits equally distributed between intergenic and intragenic locations. A similar distribution was found for all peaks/summits and CME-containing peaks/summits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g008">Fig 8B and 8C</xref>). However, this distribution differed remarkably from the global genomic location of CME and NE sites, which were both found primarily in inter- and intragenic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g008">Fig 8D</xref>), indicating a preferential binding of MYC to both the CME and the NE within promoter regions.</p>
<p>In order to determine whether the cellular concentration of MYC impacts its binding to CME or NE sites <italic>in vivo</italic>, we compared the ChIP-seq peak number and height, as well as position relative to the gene body, in cells expressing high versus low levels of MYC. Consistent with the low affinity of MYC:MAX for the NE <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g006">Fig 6</xref>), the switch from low to high MYC expression resulted in a notable increase in both the total number and average height of NE-containing summits (~7-fold and ~9-fold, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g008">Fig 8E</xref>). In contrast, the number of peaks and average height of CME-containing summits were considerably less sensitive to MYC protein concentration (~2-fold and ~5-fold, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g008">Fig 8E</xref>). Furthermore, the differential effects of MYC expression levels on the number of NE versus CME sites occupied were more pronounced at distal intergenic and intragenic sites compared to promoter regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g008">Fig 8F</xref>). Nonetheless, induction of high MYC levels enhanced the intensity of MYC binding to NE motifs within both promoters and distal regions. Examples of an increase in size of NE-containing peaks in high MYC-expressing cells are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g008">Fig 8G</xref> (for the promoters of <italic>SLC6A6</italic> and <italic>MTF2</italic> genes) and in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0180147.s006">S6 Fig</xref> (for other promoter, intergenic, and intragenic regions). These results suggest that MYC overexpression is important for binding NE sites <italic>in vivo</italic>, especially at distal regions.</p>
<p>To assess whether high-affinity CME and low-affinity NE sequences mediate the same or distinct MYC functions, we performed gene ontology analyses of promoters with MYC-bound CME motifs (CME summits lacking the NE) or MYC-bound NE motifs (NE summits lacking the CME). As expected, MYC-bound CME promoter sites are found in genes involved in a variety of biological processes, including most prominently ribosome biogenesis and cellular metabolism. In contrast, genes with MYC-occupied NE promoter sequences are not generally involved in these top biological processes, but instead appear to have a preference for the DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0180147.s007">S7 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0180147.s012">S2 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly, we repeated all the above analyses of MYC-bound genomic sequences in a different human cell line (U2OS) by re-analyzing published ChIP-seq datasets obtained under low endogenous MYC levels and after doxycycline–induced MYC overexpression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref028">28</xref>] and obtained similar results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0180147.s005">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0180147.s008">S8</xref> Figs, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0180147.s013">S3 Table</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using an unbiased PBM approach we have identified a set of 27 high-confidence hexamer motifs that are specifically bound by both MYC:MAX and MAX:MAX complexes <italic>in vitro</italic> (sequences in bold in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). These include not only the CME sequence CACGTG and other E-boxes and E-box variants, but also non-E-box motifs such as the palindromic sequence AACGTT (referred to as NE), which was not previously known to be a specific MYC/MAX binding element. Notably, we verified by EMSA that both MYC:MAX and MAX:MAX complexes bound <italic>in vitro</italic> to the new AACGTT motif in a sequence-specific manner despite the ~20–30 fold lower affinity of MYC/MAX complexes for this sequence compared to the CME. The PBM results further indicated a contribution of the nucleotides immediately flanking the core 6-mer motifs, which supports previous observations made <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref005">5</xref>] and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref023">23</xref>]. In particular, the PBM indicated that CACGTG<underline>a</underline> (or its reverse complement <underline>t</underline>CACGTG) is disfavored by both MYC:MAX and MAX:MAX complexes, which is in accord with early site selection and EMSA experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition, the PBM analyses identified low complexity G/C-rich sequences (AGGGGG, AGCGGG, AGGGGC, and CGGGGG) that were bound relatively strongly by MYC:MAX. However, these probes were not bound by MAX:MAX. This suggests that MYC may bind to these PBM probes in a sequence-independent manner that may not involve the basic region DNA-binding residues conserved between MYC and MAX. Although this observation is intriguing given the fact that <italic>in vivo</italic> MYC often binds genomic loci associated with CpG islands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref020">20</xref>], the mode of recognition of these G/C-rich probes (sequence versus structural context recognition) needs to be further investigated by additional methods. Thus, our <italic>in vitro</italic> binding studies demonstrate that MYC/MAX complexes bind to a variety of non-canonical sequences and recognize low-affinity motifs, such as the non-E-box motif AACGTT, in a sequence-specific manner. The recognition of low-affinity non-E-box sequences is distinct from the non-specific DNA binding activity of MYC:MAX that was observed <italic>in vitro</italic> at high protein and DNA concentrations in the absence of non-specific competitor DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>The crystal structures of MYC:MAX and MAX:MAX complexes bound to DNA indicate that both MYC and MAX make identical contacts with the bases on either arm of the CME palindromic sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref015">15</xref>]. These include hydrogen bonding with the first and last base pairs of the CME (<underline>C</underline>ACGT<underline>G</underline>), which are substituted in the NE motif (<underline>A</underline>ACGT<underline>T</underline>). Molecular modeling of these substitutions in the MAX:MAX-DNA co-crystal structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref014">14</xref>] suggests a possible explanation as to why the NE motif is recognized by MYC/MAX complexes, albeit with a lower affinity. We propose that the first and last base pairs (<underline>A</underline>ACGT<underline>T</underline>) of the NE may form a strong hydrogen bond (2.99 Å) between the thymine (T) and the His28 residue of MAX, while the complementary adenine (A) makes only a weak van der Waals contact with Glu32 of MAX (4.26Å). Other base pairs at these positions (distinct from CME or NE) would either clash with the structure or be too distant to make contact with MAX (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0180147.s009">S9 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Analysis of chromatin loci bound by MYC in the genome of human P493-6 B-cells indicated that ~87% of all MYC-occupied sequences (ChIP-seq summits) contain at least one of the top 21 MYC:MAX-bound motifs identified by the PBM (excluding the low complexity G/C-rich motifs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g001">Fig 1E</xref>) in both low- and high-MYC expressing cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0180147.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). Notably, we found that the NE motif AACGTT is present within MYC-bound genomic sequences (in both P493-6 and U2OS cells) at frequencies comparable to those of many E-box motifs. These observations support the previous finding that MYC often binds genomic loci that lack high affinity E-boxes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref023">23</xref>]. However, that does not mean that such binding is necessarily “non-specific”, as previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref023">23</xref>]. Rather, we propose that MYC binding to low-affinity sites such as AACGTT may contribute to cooperative DNA binding with other transcription factors or chromatin-associated factors, in accord with recent findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref040">40</xref>].</p>
<p>In human cells (P493-6 and U2OS) MYC bound both the CME (CACGTG) and the AACGTT motif preferentially within promoter regions and MYC overexpression increased binding to both types of promoter motifs. Notably, however, the most prevalent functions of genes with MYC-bound CME promoter motifs (ribosome biogenesis and metabolic processes) were not enriched in the genes with MYC-occupied AACGTT promoter motifs, which tended to be involved in the DNA damage response. Moreover, MYC overexpression preferentially increased the number of occupied AACGTT sites relative to CME sites, especially at distal inter/intragenic loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180147.g008">Fig 8F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0180147.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). Hence, MYC expression levels and recognition of distinct DNA sequences with different affinities might influence distinct genetic programs, as was recently proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0180147.ref028">28</xref>].</p>
<p>In conclusion, our results suggest that overexpression of MYC allows for sequence-specific binding to the NE motif AACGTT, and raise the intriguing possibility that the marked induction of <italic>de novo</italic> MYC binding to low-affinity AACGTT-containing genomic loci (especially those distal to promoters) could be important for the oncogenic effects of MYC overexpression that is characteristic of many cancers.</p>
