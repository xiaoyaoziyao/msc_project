<abstract>
<p>Macrophages are a main component of atherosclerotic plaques. Recent studies suggest that pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages are pro-atherogenic while M2 macrophages promote plaque stability. Moreover, toll-like receptor signalling pathways are implicated in atherosclerotic plaque formation, evolution and regression. We propose microRNAs as key regulators of these processes. In this context, our goal is to promote inflammation resolution using miR-195 to reduce M1-like macrophage polarization and to evaluate the molecular mechanisms underlying such effect, as well as to explore the functional consequences for smooth muscle cell recruitment. Human primary macrophages were differentiated from peripheral blood monocytes and stimulated with LPS or IL-10 to promote M1 or M2c polarization, respectively. miR-195 levels were upregulated in M2c macrophages compared with M1 macrophages. In THP-1 macrophages stimulated with LPS and IFN-γ, results show that TLR2 levels were reduced by miR-195 overexpression compared with scrambled control. In addition, phosphorylated forms of p54 JNK, p46 JNK and p38 MAPK were decreased by miR-195 in macrophages following M1 stimulation. Moreover, miR-195 significantly decreased levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α pro-inflammatory cytokines in the supernatants of M1-stimulated macrophage cultures. At the functional level, results from smooth muscle cell recruitment and migration models showed that miR-195 impairs the capacity of M1 macrophages to promote smooth muscle cells migration. In conclusion, miR-195 is involved in macrophage polarization and inhibits TLR2 inflammatory pathway mediators. Moreover, miR-195 impairs the effect of macrophages on smooth muscle cells recruitment capacity and migration profile. Thus, miR-195 might be used as a new potential tool to promote inflammation resolution in cardiovascular research.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chronic inflammation is a major feature of atherosclerosis, which underlies several cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref002">2</xref>]. In atherosclerosis, the normal homeostatic functions of the endothelium are altered, promoting an inflammatory response. Initially, adhesion molecules expressed by inflamed endothelium recruit leukocytes, mainly monocytes, which penetrate into the intima and differentiate into macrophages, predisposing the vessel wall to lipid accretion or vasculitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref003">3</xref>]. Many of the inflammatory processes that occur throughout atherogenesis are orchestrated by resident and recruited macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref005">5</xref>]. These cells can adopt diverse activation states in response to micro-environmental triggers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Macrophage heterogeneity is particularly important in atherosclerosis lesions due to the opposing roles of M1 (pro-inflammatory) and M2 (anti-inflammatory) macrophage phenotypes, which are dependent on the inflammatory molecules present in the microenvironment. During disease progression, the increase in the total number of macrophages and the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines has an enormous impact in increased plaque vulnerability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref007">7</xref>]. In the lesion site most prone to plaque rupture, macrophages expressing pro-inflammatory markers are shown to be the most predominant population, while in the fibrous cap regions, M2 macrophages are shown to have greater impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref008">8</xref>]. Thus, although potential deleterious effects of M1 macrophages could be counteracted by the protective pro-fibrotic and tissue repair effects of M2 macrophages in the fibrous cap, the limited number of M2 macrophages in the plaque cannot balance the M1-mediated effects, promoting plaque instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref009">9</xref>]. The emerging understanding about macrophage interactions with vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in the atherosclerotic plaque, and how macrophage secretion profile influence VSMC phenotype, led to the general consensus that pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages are pro-atherogenic, while M2 macrophages may promote plaque stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref011">11</xref>]. Therefore, modulation of macrophage function by reducing their pro-inflammatory activity in order to promote plaque stability is an exciting therapeutic prospect.</p>
<p>microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs (approximately 15–25 nucleotides long) crucial for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Mature miRNAs bind to 3′untranslated region (UTR), coding regions or 5′UTR of messenger RNAs (mRNAs), inhibiting translation or causing mRNA degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref012">12</xref>]. Importantly, miRNAs are involved in key cellular functions, including macrophage polarization. Thus, miRNAs are able to modulate the magnitude of an inflammatory response by targeting mRNA encoding cytokines, surface receptors and other inflammation-related molecules, which have direct consequences in macrophage phenotypes. Recently, several miRNAs have been shown to be involved in pathways that induce M1 (miR-9, miR-127 and miR-155) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref015">15</xref>] and M2 (miR-125a-5p, miR-146a, miR-223 and let-7c) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref018">18</xref>] macrophage polarizations, while others are directly involved in the promotion and aggravation of atherosclerosis. Interestingly, miR-195 inhibits VSMC proliferation and migration, and reduces neointimal formation in a balloon-injured carotid artery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref019">19</xref>], which shows that miR-195 plays a role in the cardiovascular system.</p>
<p>A single miRNA is able to regulate a large number of mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref012">12</xref>] and potentially regulate simultaneously inflammation and atherosclerosis processes, which encourages their use as therapeutic targets in the context of atherosclerosis lesions. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of miR-195 in inflammation resolution through modulation of macrophage polarization and to determine the consequent functional effect on their crosstalk with other cellular components of the plaque, namely smooth muscle cells.</p>

<title>Human primary monocyte isolation, differentiation and polarization</title>
<p>Human primary monocytes were obtained from healthy blood donors buffy coats (BC). RosetteSep human monocyte enrichment isolation kit (StemCell Technologies) was used, according to Oliveira <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref020">20</xref>]. Firstly, BC were centrifuged at room temperature (RT) for 20 minutes (min) at 1200 g, without active acceleration or brake, for blood components separation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) layer, and red blood cells necessary to the formation of immunorosettes, were collected and incubated with RosetteSep human monocyte enrichment isolation kit (Stemcell Technologies) for 20 min, under gentle mixing.

<p>Evaluation of miR-195 effect on the capacity of THP-1 macrophages to recruit HUASMC was assessed by transwell assays.

Then, HUASMC in FBS-free media were plated in Boyden chambers (inserts) with PET membranes of 8 μm pore size, previously coated with sterile 1% BSA (top compartment of the transwell system–TC). Finally inserts were placed on top of the wells containing THP-1 derived cells, and HUASMC were allowed to migrate through the membrane for 24h. M1 stimulation cytokines only, non-stimulated, and non-transfected THP-1 macrophages were used as controls for HUASMC migration. Then, culture media was removed and membranes washed twice with PBS. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at RT. Insert membranes were washed again with PBS and the inner side of the membrane was scrubbed with a cotton swab to remove non-migrated cells. Membrane was removed from the insert and mounted on a microscope slide using Fluoroshield with DAPI (Sigma). Six random fields of migrated nuclei were counted per membrane and fold-change in migration was calculated relative to non-stimulated, non-transfected THP-1 macrophages.</p>
<p>For wound healing assays, HUASMC were plated in 24 well plates pre-coated with collagen type I (0.15x10<sup>5</sup> cells/m<sup>2</sup>). Cells were cultured in DMEM F12 containing 10% FBS until they reached 80% confluence. Then, the monolayer was disrupted in the middle of the well, using a plastic tip, to create a “wound”. Cells were then washed with PBS 1x and cultured with conditioned media from differently stimulated THP-1 macrophages, up to 36 hours. Images of the wound area were obtained at 0, 12, 24 and 36 hours using a 5x objective, and gap area quantified using Fiji Software to evaluate HUASMC migration.</p>

<title>miR-195 is increased in human M2 macrophages</title>
<p>In order to investigate the role of miR-195 on macrophage polarization phenotypes relevant to atherosclerosis, levels of miR-195 were evaluated upon macrophage treatment with different stimuli to induce alterations in macrophage polarization status. Primary human monocytes were successfully isolated and differentiated into macrophages, as shown by optical microscopy observation and flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188530.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). More than 90% of the cells were positive for CD14, the macrophage lineage cell marker, indicating high purity of the cell population after isolation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188530.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). Next, to induce macrophage polarization into pro-inflammatory M1 or anti-inflammatory M2c phenotypes, cells were treated with 10 ng/mL LPS or 10 ng/mL IL-10, respectively. Macrophage polarization was evaluated by flow cytometry for cell surface expression of M1 marker CD86 and M2c marker CD163. Results from 9 independent donors show, as expected, significantly higher mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) levels of cell surface marker CD86 in LPS-treated macrophages (MFI = 173.9 ± 96.1) compared with IL-10-treated macrophages (MFI = 35.2 ±15.1; p&lt;0.01) or with the non-treated macrophages (MFI = 38.4 ± 21.0; p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188530.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, left plot; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188530.s001">S1C Fig</xref>).

<title>miR-195 reduces TLR2 levels in macrophages</title>
<p>TLR activation is implicated in atherogenesis, as it initiates signaling cascades that culminate in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, foam cell formation and activation of adaptive immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref026">26</xref>]. Therefore, we explored the impact of miR-195 in the expression of TLRs known to be involved in human atherosclerotic plaques formation, namely TLR2 and TLR4. To address this, gain-of-function studies were performed in THP-1 macrophages. Transfections of miR-195 mimics were successfully performed, as shown by RT-qPCR results (p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188530.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Results show that TLR2 levels are significantly increased at the cell surface (p&lt;0.05) and intracellularly (p&lt;0.01) of SCR-transfected cells, upon stimulation for M1 phenotype compared with control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188530.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). Importantly, under pro-inflammatory conditions, cells overexpressing miR-195 show a significant reduction in TLR2 at the cell surface and intracellularly compared with M1 macrophages transfected with SCR (p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188530.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Similarly, TLR2 intracellular levels are decreased by miR-195-overexpressing cells compared with SCR in a pro-inflammatory environment (p = 0.0552). Levels of TLR4 were also evaluated, and results show a significant decrease of cell surface TLR4 upon M1 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188530.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), indicating that this receptor is internalized after LPS binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188530.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), in agreement with previous work by us and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref029">29</xref>].

<p>Following these results, we hypothesized that miR-195 could influence TLR2 expression by directly targeting its mRNA. To address this hypothesis, we followed an unbiased bioinformatics approach whereby prediction databases for miRNA-mRNA interaction were screened and tested for complementary base pair interaction between miR-195 and TLR2 mRNA. TLR2 was predicted to be a target of miR-195 by RNA22 and miRWalk algorithms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188530.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). To confirm the interaction, luciferase assays were performed with and without mutation of the predicted binding site. However, the results obtained show no direct interaction between miR-195 and TLR2 for the predicted binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188530.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), suggesting TLR2 expression is regulated by miR-195 through an indirect mechanism.</p>

<title>miR-195 inhibits the TLR2 signaling pathway</title>

Total and phosphorylated levels of p54 JNK, p46 JNK and p38 MAPK downstream kinases were analyzed upon pro-inflammatory stimulation. Differentiated THP-1 macrophages were stimulated with the M1 pro-inflammatory stimuli of LPS and IFN-γ at different time points. The peak phosphorylation levels of p54/p46 JNK were found to be around 15 and 30 min and of p38 MAPK around 5 and 15 minutes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188530.s004">S4A Fig</xref>).

Results are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188530.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, and show that phosphorylation levels of p54 and p46 JNK and p38 MAPK are all significantly downregulated in miR-195-overexpressing cells, which indicates an active repression of TLR2 downstream effectors. Specifically, 30 min after M1 stimulation, phospho-p54 and phospho-p38 levels show a reduction of 25% (p&lt;0.05) and 41% (p&lt;0.05), respectively, in miR-195-overexpressing THP-1 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188530.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).

<title>miR-195 expression impacts inflammatory and atherosclerosis associated pathways</title>
<p>To further identify relevant genes and pathways targeted by miR-195, the expression profile of THP-1 macrophages overexpressing miR-195 was compared with SCR-transfected cells. Bioinformatics analysis of the expression levels of the 92 genes significantly downregulated (fold change&lt;-1.5, P-value&lt;0.05) by miR-195 in THP-1 macrophages revealed that atherosclerosis signaling (P-value = 0.0147) is one of the top canonical pathways, as a result of F3, S100A8 and ALOX5 downregulation (fold change: -1.93, -6.87 and -1.65, respectively), three genes known to be involved in important mechanisms that contribute to disease pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188530.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref031">31</xref>]. Importantly, RT-qPCR results confirmed that F3 and S100A8 were significantly downregulated in macrophages overexpressing miR-195 compared with SCR-transfected macrophages (p&lt;0.05). Regarding ALOX5, although not statistically significant, its expression levels tend to be downregulated by miR-195 as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188530.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).</p>

<title>Expression of miR-195 in macrophages inhibits smooth muscle cells recruitment and migration profile</title>
<p>In advanced stages of atherosclerosis, pro-inflammatory macrophages promote the recruitment of VSMC to the lesioned area, which also become lipid loaded foam cells, producing pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref032">32</xref>].

Results show that miR-195-THP-1 macrophages in pro-inflammatory conditions have significantly less capability to recruit HUASMC compared with non-transfected (p&lt;0.01) and SCR-transfected pro-inflammatory THP-1 macrophages (p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188530.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>). Specifically, high expression levels of miR-195 in THP-1 macrophages reduce cell capability to recruit HUASMC by 40% (versus M1 non-transfected) and 50% (versus M1 SCR-macrophages) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188530.g006">Fig 6D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>miR-195 has been shown to control major cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, proliferation, migration and invasion, and cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref035">35</xref>]. In the cardiovascular system, miR-195 regulates VSMC proliferation, migration and cytokine secretion profile, and prevents neointimal formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref019">19</xref>]. Importantly, macrophages and VSMCs are major players in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic vascular diseases. Activated pro-inflammatory macrophages promote pro-atherogenic functions of VSMCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref011">11</xref>]. For this reason, we hypothesized and evaluated if the anti-atherogenic miR-195 could act through macrophages by inhibiting their pro-inflammatory action and conditioning the communication with VSMCs.</p>
<p>Herein, we describe for the first time that miR-195 levels are increased in IL-10-treated human primary macrophages and further investigated miR-195 as a potential tool to inhibit mechanisms that promote M1 macrophage polarization. Macrophages can be polarized towards different phenotypes, depending on the microenvironment they encounter, and miRNA expression profiles have been explored to understand in which extent alterations in miRNA levels influence the immune functions of polarized macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref036">36</xref>]. For instance, miR-125a-5p inhibits the classical macrophage activation and decreases secretion of some inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref037">37</xref>], and miR-146a inhibits the activation of TLR4-dependent signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>TLRs recognize distinct damage-associated molecular patterns and play a critical role in inflammation and immune cell regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref038">38</xref>]. Activation of TLR-dependent signaling pathways promotes the consecutive phosphorylation of several protein kinases, leading to activation of MAP kinases (JNK, p38 MAPK and ERK) and activating the NF-κB transcription factor complex. Subsequently, transcription factors in the nucleus downstream the TLR signaling cascade are activated and induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref040">40</xref>]. In this study, we investigated how miR-195 impairs the activation of these pathways, analyzing TLR receptors and downstream molecules. TLR2 is known to be overexpressed in macrophages after LPS recognition and in pro-inflammatory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref042">42</xref>], acting as a key player in inflammation and atherosclerosis progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref043">43</xref>]. Furthermore, the regulation of its expression through miR-19 and miR-105 has been described by other authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref045">45</xref>]. Our results show, for the first time, that the expression of TLR2 is regulated by miR-195, as its levels are significantly reduced in miR-195-transfected THP-1 macrophages polarized towards M1 phenotype. Although a TLR2 mRNA::miRNA-195 direct interaction for the predicted binding site was not found, we do not exclude the hypothesis of an interaction in other region of the TLR2 mRNA. Moreover, the effect could be indirect through miR-195 binding to TLR2 regulators and transcription factors.</p>
<p>Although JNK isoforms (p54, p46) and p38 MAPK total protein levels were not altered, the activated/phosphorylated p54 JNK, p46 JNK and p38 MAPK forms were significantly decreased by miR-195. Remarkably, levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α were reduced, which indicates that miR-195 efficiently inhibits the pro-inflammatory TLR2 signalling pathway, specifically p38 MAPK and JNK pathways, reinforcing the hypothesis that this specific miRNA acts as an anti-inflammatory regulator in macrophages. Moreover, expression of other genes associated with inflammatory pathways was found deregulated. Therefore, miR-195 can be used as a tool to counterbalance and reverse the effect of the induced M1 pro-inflammatory profile in macrophages.</p>
<p>In advanced states of atherosclerotic lesions, macrophages secrete high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which perpetuate the inflammatory process and promote migration of VSMC into the intima [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref046">46</xref>]. Sequentially, VSMC proliferate and secrete pro-fibrotic mediators, resulting in the fibrous cap formation. At some stages, this fibroproliferative response is associated with a protective physiologic response to injury, designed to wall off the injurious agent, and then to assist in resolution of the injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref047">47</xref>]. However, atherosclerotic VSMC are described to switch to a macrophage-like phenotype characterized by lipid over-ingestion, which leads to VSMC apoptosis and, consequently, to a necrotic core formation and weakening of the fibrous cap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref048">48</xref>]. Thus, it is of crucial importance to limit both VSMC migration and the phenotypic switch.</p>
<p>To mimic <italic>in vitro</italic> the VSMC migration profile upon interaction with macrophages and the crosstalk between macrophages and VSMC in the atherogenic environment, we performed a transwell (using porous PET membranes) and a wound healing assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188530.ref049">49</xref>]. Interestingly, both assays showed that macrophages overexpressing miR-195 drastically lose their ability to promote VSMC recruitment in a pro-inflammatory environment. Although further experiments are needed to understand which mediators are changed by miR-195 and how do they affect VSMC-macrophages crosstalk, this is the first evidence that modulation of macrophage phenotype through miR-195 has a paracrine effect on VSMC.</p>
<p>In conclusion, miR-195 impacts macrophage polarization status, favoring an anti-inflammatory phenotype even in pro-inflammatory conditions, which leads to a reduction in the recruitment of VSMC. This suggests miR-195 as a potential tool to prevent and potentially treat atherosclerotic lesions and other cardiovascular diseases.</p>
