<abstract>
<p>The upper few millimeters of soil harbour photosynthetic microbial communities that are structurally distinct from those of underlying bulk soil due to the presence of light. Previous studies in arid zones have demonstrated functional importance of these communities in reducing soil erosion, and enhancing carbon and nitrogen fixation. Despite being widely distributed, comparative understanding of the biodiversity of the soil surface and underlying soil is lacking, particularly in temperate zones. We investigated the establishment of soil surface communities on pasture soil in microcosms exposed to light or dark conditions, focusing on changes in phototroph, bacterial and fungal communities at the soil surface (0–3 mm) and bulk soil (3–12 mm) using ribosomal marker gene analyses. Microbial community structure changed with time and structurally similar phototrophic communities were found at the soil surface and in bulk soil in the light exposed microcosms suggesting that light can influence phototroph community structure even in the underlying bulk soil. 454 pyrosequencing showed a significant selection for diazotrophic cyanobacteria such as <italic>Nostoc punctiforme</italic> and <italic>Anabaena</italic> spp., in addition to the green alga <italic>Scenedesmus obliquus</italic>. The soil surface also harboured distinct heterotrophic bacterial and fungal communities in the presence of light, in particular, the selection for the phylum Firmicutes. However, these light driven changes in bacterial community structure did not extend to the underlying soil suggesting a discrete zone of influence, analogous to the rhizosphere.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The upper few millimeters of soil are an area with physicochemical conditions distinct from those of bulk soil as a result of the surface being exposed to light and other environmental factors such as wind and rain erosion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Jeffery1">[1]</xref>. Soil surface communities are different from those of bulk soil due to the development of photosynthetic communities such as cyanobacteria, algae, mosses, and lichens, which can form biological soil crusts (BSC) with time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-GarciaPichel1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Zhang1">[7]</xref>. There has been a dramatic rise in publications reporting on the role of BSCs recently as it has become recognized that this area is a distinct ecosystem with increased nutrient levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-BeraldiCampesi1">[8]</xref> and erosion resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Zhang2">[9]</xref> compared to soil without phototroph communities. BSC research to date has focused on arid and semi-arid lands such as the Colorado plateau and Sonoran desert in the USA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-GarciaPichel1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Yeager1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Nagy1">[10]</xref>, Gurbantunggut desert in northwest China <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Zhang1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Zhang2">[9]</xref>, Negev desert in Israel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Zaady1">[11]</xref> and Oman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Abed1">[6]</xref>, where phototroph communities have been estimated to cover up to 70% of the soil surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Pointing1">[12]</xref>. BSCs have also been shown to be widespread in temperate soils and under agricultural crops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Langhans1">[5]</xref>, , however, little is known about their community structure and ecological significance.</p>
<p>In arid environments, soil surface communities have several important functions, including the release of exopolysaccharides from fungi and cyanobacteria which bind soil into aggregates, improving soil structure and reducing the impact of wind erosion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Belnap1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Tisdall1">[19]</xref>. Another key function of soil surface communities is fixation of N<sub>2</sub> by diazotrophic cyanobacteria such as <italic>Nostoc</italic> spp. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Yeager1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Belnap2">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Li2">[24]</xref>, and C fixation by phototrophs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Housman1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-CastilloMonroy1">[27]</xref>, which may be the reason for higher soil C and N levels in soil with a BSC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-BeraldiCampesi1">[8]</xref>. The development of phototrophs at the soil surface has also been shown to have a profound impact on plant growth and biomass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Langhans2">[28]</xref> and result in increased levels of N, K, and Cu in plant tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Harper1">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>The development of BSC communities in arid environments is characterized by a succession from cyanobacteria dominated to lichen- and moss- dominated crusts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Lange1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Li3">[32]</xref>. Further, a succession within cyanobacteria dominated crusts has also been noted from <italic>Microcoleus vaginatus</italic> to <italic>Nostoc</italic> spp./<italic>Tolypothrix</italic> spp. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Yeager1">[4]</xref>. However, our understanding of the community structure remains very limited, not least because the majority of studies investigating phototroph diversity in BSCs have used culture dependent methods which are prone to bias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Langhans1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Zhang1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Zhang2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Li3">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Hawkes1">[33]</xref>, or molecular methods that target 16S rRNA of bacteria, which ignore the diversity of eukaryotic phototrophs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-GarciaPichel1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Redfield1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Abed1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Nagy1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Zaady1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Steven1">[34]</xref>. Molecular microbial community analysis of bacterial diversity at the soil surface has shown a dominance by cyanobacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-GarciaPichel1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Redfield1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Abed1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Zaady1">[11]</xref>, for example, Abed <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Abed1">[6]</xref> found that 77–81% of clones from BSCs of Oman had close homology to cyanobacteria. Consequently, the diversity and community composition of heterotrophic bacteria at the soil surface is not well characterised. Likewise, although fungi have been shown to provide key ecosystem services of BSCs such as structural cohesion provided by hyphal entanglement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Tisdall1">[19]</xref>, little is known regarding the fungal community structure at the soil surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Bates1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Bates2">[36]</xref>.</p>
<p>In contrast to arid and semi-arid soils, our understanding of the structure and function of soil surface communities in temperate and agricultural soils is limited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Langhans1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Langhans2">[28]</xref>. Phototrophs have been shown to develop under agricultural cropping systems such as wheat, maize and sugar beet between 50 and 80 days after tillage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Knapen1">[15]</xref>. The presence of these communities reduced soil erosion rates and this reduction increased with the successional age of the crust <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Knapen1">[15]</xref>. However, soil tillage removed this functionally important community for at least 50 days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Knapen1">[15]</xref>. Phototroph communities may also have other important agricultural functions, for example, several phototrophs have been shown to break down pesticides in pure culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Thomas1">[37]</xref> and therefore phototrophs may have a role in pesticide degradation at the soil surface. An understanding of the communities and functions of soil surface communities in temperate environments will inform agricultural management decisions such as the benefits of reduced tillage practices.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated shifts in phototroph, bacterial and fungal community structure between the soil surface and bulk soil of a pasture soil from a temperate climate throughout the development of phototroph communities at the soil surface. We used universal phototroph primers designed to amplify ribosomal RNA genes of any plastid-containing organisms, 454 pyrosequencing of PCR amplicons, and measured soil pH and nutrient levels with the aim of answering the following questions: (i) How diverse are cyanobacteria and eukaryotic phototrophs at the soil surface? (ii) Does light influence bacterial and fungal community structure and diversity at the soil surface? (iii) Are there successional changes in phototroph, bacterial and fungal communities at the soil surface and underlying bulk soil? (iv) Does the establishment of soil surface communities affect chemical parameters and microbial community structure of underlying bulk soil?</p>

<title>Soil</title>
<p>Soil was sourced from Les Barges, Switzerland (CH-1896 Vouvry) in October, 2010. The site did not contain any protected wildlife and it is owned by Syngenta who authorized sampling. Approximately 40 kg was sampled from the top 15 cm of Gartenacker soil (silty loam), which was then sieved to 2 mm and homogenized by mixing to give an average representation of the community structure and chemical properties of the volume of sampled soil. Microbial communities in the upper 15 cm of soil are routinely disturbed and mixed by tillage. Soil was therefore sampled to this depth and homogenized before being setup in microscoms in order to simulate natural mixing of surface communities in agricultural systems. The land had been used for pasture for over 20 years without the application of pesticides. The physico-chemical properties of Gartenacker soil are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069048.s007">Table S1</xref>.</p>

<title>Test System and Sampling Soil Surface Communities</title>
<p>To follow development of soil surface communities [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069048.s001">Figure S1</xref>] a modified design was used from Jeffery <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Jeffery1">[1]</xref> with dimensions of 20 cm×15.5 cm×1.8 cm. Trays were filled with 600 g Gartenacker soil (35% water content) and soil was flattened to minimise soil surface heterogeneity. Trays were covered with either: (i) DS 226 light filter, or (ii) an opaque filter (Lee Filters, Andover, UK). In order to study the impact of light on microbial community development, soil was incubated in a controlled constant environment chamber on a 16 h:8 h light:dark cycle at 200 µmol s<sup>−−1</sup> m<sup>−1</sup> (Philips Master fluorescent lights (&gt;360 nm) TLD 36 W/840) at a constant temperature of 20°C±2°C. This allowed the development of soil surface communities to be investigated under controlled conditions by removing confounding climatic variables. Trays were setup in triplicate using a randomised design; moisture content was checked weekly by weight and maintained by watering from above using a pipette.</p>
<p>Triplicate trays were destructively sampled at 0, 20, 40, and 80 days. This sampling strategy aimed to follow the development of early-successional phototroph communities based on previous work, which showed development of phototrophs under cropping systems between 50 and 80 days following tillage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Knapen1">[15]</xref>. At each sampling point, a stainless steel sheet was run under the soil surface at a measured depth of 3 mm to separate the soil surface (upper 3 mm) from the underlying bulk soil (3–12 mm). Surface and bulk soil samples were frozen at −20°C in polyethylene zip bags for 48 h before freeze-drying for 72 h. Freeze-dried soil was homogenised using a mortar and pestle and stored at −20°C.</p>

<p>Phototroph, bacterial and fungal PCR amplicons from the soil surface incubated under light and dark conditions for 80 days were pyrosequenced by Research and Testing Laboratory (Lubbock, TX, USA) (RTL) using a Roche 454 FLX instrument and Titanium reagents. Bacterial Tag-encoded pyrosequencing was performed as described previously by Dowd <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Dowd1">[50]</xref>. Fungal and phototroph pyrosequencing were performed according to the same protocol using the primer pairs described in the previous section. Pyrosequencing gave a total of 67658, 22672 and 77470 reads across six samples for bacteria, fungi and phototrophs, respectively.</p>

<title>Processing of 454 Sequence Data</title>
<p>Sequences were processed using QIIME v. 1.4.0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Caporaso1">[51]</xref> by selecting sequences with an average quality score &gt;25, containing no ambiguous bases or homopolymers longer than six base pairs, without any primer mismatches, and a sequence length between 250–430 bp (bacteria), 250–390 bp (fungi) and 330–410 bp (phototrophs). Sequences were also denoised using Denoiser <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Reeder1">[52]</xref>. Following denoising, methods of data processing differed for bacteria, fungi and phototrophs. Bacterial OTUs were picked at a 97% similarity threshold using UCLUST <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Edgar1">[53]</xref> and representative sequences were picked using the most abundant method before PyNAST aligning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Caporaso2">[54]</xref> with the 16S rRNA Greengenes database aligned at 97% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-DeSantis1">[55]</xref>. Chimeras were identified using ChimeraSlayer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Haas1">[56]</xref> and taxonomy was assigned using the RDP classifier and default settings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Wang1">[57]</xref>. Processing of fungi and phototrophs used UCHIME <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Edgar2">[58]</xref> for <italic>de novo</italic> chimera identification. Taxonomy was assigned using the RDP classifier for fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Wang1">[57]</xref> and BLAST <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Altschul1">[59]</xref> for phototrophs. Phylogenetic trees showing sequence abundance data were created using MEGAN 4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Huson1">[60]</xref>. Full details of the number of sequences removed at each processing step are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069048.s009">Tables S3</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069048.s011">S5</xref>.

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Parametric tests on non-transformed data were performed where possible. If assumptions were not met, data was log transformed. One-way ANOVA was performed on chlorophyll <italic>a</italic>, pH and soil nutrient data, and t-tests were performed on MPN for algae and phototroph abundance data. All analyses were performed using Minitab version 15. TRF data was analysed using GeneMarker and statistically analysed using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis, ANOSIM and SIMPER using PRIMER6 (Plymouth, UK). Pyrosequencing data was rarefied at 3317, 6322 and 964 reads for phototrophs, bacteria and fungi, respectively and QIIME v.1.4.0 was used for: ANOVAs to compare taxonomy abundance data and t-tests to compare α diversity. Chao1 was used as a mark-release-recapture assessment of diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Chao1">[61]</xref> and Observed Species as an assessment of the number of unique OTUs in a sample.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Light had a significant effect on phototroph community structure, soil nutrients and pH, and this effect extended to the underlying bulk soil. Light also had a significant, time-dependent impact on heterotrophic bacterial and fungal community structure which was restricted to the soil surface. Soil surface communities are typically defined by the presence of photosynthetic communities in the top 1–3 mm of soil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Jeffery1">[1]</xref>, however, we show changes in phototroph community structure at a depth greater than 3 mm, and the presence of distinct heterotrophic microbial communities at the soil surface in the presence of light.</p>
<p>Chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> analysis was used as a broad-scale assessment of phototroph biomass development, and it indicated both the development of phototrophs at the soil surface after 20 days and the restriction of phototrophs to the soil surface under light conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069048-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The presence of light also significantly increased soil pH and reduced extractable NO<sub>3</sub> and extractable Mg at both the soil surface and underlying bulk soil under light compared to dark conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0069048-t001">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, although phototrophs appeared to be restricted to the soil surface, the influence of light extended to bulk soil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069048-g001">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0069048-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>TRFLP analysis of phototrophs was used as a fine-scale assessment of community structure, and it showed development of distinct communities at the soil surface and bulk soil under light compared to dark incubated soil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069048-g002">Figures 2a–2c</xref>). In contrast to chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> data, TRFLP analysis showed no difference in phototroph community structure between the soil surface and underlying bulk soil under light conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069048-g002">Figures 2a–2c</xref>). Therefore, fine-scale molecular analysis has shown a new depth of influence of light on phototroph community structure that previous broad-scale assessments have missed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Jeffery1">[1]</xref>. It has previously been shown that approximately 0.3% of light is transmitted beyond the top 2 mm of soils with the highest transmittance of light <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Benvenuti1">[62]</xref>. Therefore, these shifts in phototroph community structure in bulk soil may be driven by attenuated light penetrating small cracks present at the soil surface. Alternatively, penetration of filamentous cyanobacteria into underlying soil may be a consequence of primary production at the soil surface under light conditions. These hypotheses require further testing, particularly in cracking clay soils where light penetration through soil cracks could result in significant shifts in phototroph community structure at even greater depths.</p>
<p>Distinct bacterial and fungal communities developed at the soil surface under light conditions compared to bulk soil, and dark incubated soil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069048-g002">Figures 2d &amp; 2e</xref>). Although chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> data showed the development of phototrophs after only 20 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069048-g001">Figure 1</xref>), shifts in bacterial and fungal communities were only evident after 40 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069048-g002">Figures 2d &amp; 2e</xref>). This time lag may be controlled by the time taken for light to indirectly affect soil pH and/or nutrient availability. The influence of light on bacterial and fungal communities was restricted to the soil surface which suggests they are either directly responding to light which is attenuated at lower depths, and/or indirectly responding to nutrients that are only altered at the soil surface, presumably as a result of the growth of phototrophs, such as extractable P or extractable K. Alternatively, heterotrophic bacterial and fungal communities may have an indirect response to availability of C fixed by phototrophs at the soil surface.</p>
<p>Light may also exert an additional indirect effect on community structure by elevating temperature and therefore accelerating the frequency of drying-rewetting cycles at the soil surface. It has previously been shown that drying-rewetting regimes can influence bacterial composition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Fierer1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Placella1">[64]</xref> and fungal PLFA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Gordon1">[65]</xref>. Placella <italic>et al</italic>. (2012) showed significant declines in the relative abundances of Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria, significant increases in the relative abundances of β- and γ- proteobacteria, and specific α-proteobacteria such as Sphingomonadales, and a bell-shaped response for Bacilli after soil re-wetting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Placella1">[64]</xref>. Relative composition analysis showed a similar effect of light on Bacilli and Sphingomonadales in the current study, which could be a consequence of more pronounced wet-dry cycles under light compared to dark conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069048-g006">Figure 6</xref>). However, it is important to note that Placella <italic>et al</italic>. (2012) investigated shifts in active communities over a short time-period (72-hour) after total soil water content was increased by ∼30% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Placella1">[64]</xref>. In contrast, weekly monitoring of soil moisture content in the current study showed water content did not differ by &gt;1% between light and dark incubated samples.</p>
<p>Studies of the soil surface have typically focused on how bacterial and fungal communities differ based on geographical location, desert type, or aridity level; a direct impact of light on heterotrophic communities, however, has not been reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Abed1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Zaady1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Bates2">[36]</xref>. Moreover, we show community shifts between 40 and 80 days following a simulated tillage event, which adds to studies conducted under agricultural cropping systems, which have shown phototroph development between 50 and 80 days after tillage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Knapen1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>Phototroph diversity has been investigated using cultivation-dependent techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Zhang1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Zhang2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Steven1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Li3">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Hawkes1">[33]</xref> or molecular analysis targeting bacterial diversity in arid lands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-GarciaPichel1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Redfield1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Abed1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Nagy1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Zaady1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Steven1">[34]</xref>, however, we reveal the diversity of both cyanobacteria and eukaryotic phototrophs at the soil surface of a temperate soil using 454 pyrosequencing. Using relative composition analysis, we show specific cyanobacterial taxa being selected for by light, namely <italic>N. punctiforme</italic>, <italic>A. cylindrica</italic> and <italic>A. variabilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069048-g003">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069048-g004">4</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0069048-t002">Table 2</xref>). The fact that relative composition analysis showed that significantly more reads were assigned to cryptomonads, red algae, brown algae, mosses, and angiosperms in the dark reflects that these proliferated less than cyanobacteria in the light but are nonetheless present in the seed bank of phototrophs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069048-g004">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0069048-t002">Table 2</xref>). The dominant cyanobacteria of BSCs has been shown to be influenced by several factors, including the type of BSC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Redfield1">[3]</xref>, successional stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Yeager1">[4]</xref>, underlying soil substrata <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-GarciaPichel1">[2]</xref>, and the level of aridity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Zaady1">[11]</xref>. We show a selection for the diazotrophic cyanobacterium <italic>N. punctiforme</italic> at the surface of temperate soil, consistent with results documented in mature, or late-successional BSCs from arid lands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-GarciaPichel1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Yeager1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Abed1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Zhang1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Nagy1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Steven1">[34]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069048-g004">Figure 4</xref>). This suggests that diazotrophic cyanobacteria may also be important ecosystem engineers in temperate environments, in addition to arid zones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Yeager1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Belnap2">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Li2">[24]</xref>. However, the contribution of surface communities to N<sub>2</sub> fixation in temperate soils or agricultural systems remains to be elucidated. Such data could be beneficial for informing agricultural management decisions, for example, the realization that diazotrophs were able to fix an agriculturally significant proportion of N<sub>2</sub> could influence decisions relating to soil tillage and the amount, frequency and timing of N fertiliser application under cropping systems.</p>
<p>454 pyrosequencing revealed that light also selected for heterotrophic bacteria at the soil surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069048-g006">Figure 6</xref>). We found that in contrast to the desert soils studied to date <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-GarciaPichel1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Redfield1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Abed1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Zaady1">[11]</xref>, few bacterial sequences (&lt;4%) had close homology to cyanobacteria, allowing shifts in heterotrophic bacteria to be assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069048-g005">Figure 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069048-g006">6</xref>). The comparative reduction in bacterial diversity under light conditions was not due to a selection for cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069048-g006">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0069048-t002">Table 2</xref>) as α diversity was still significantly lower under light conditions (p≤0.01) after the removal of photosynthetic bacterial OTUs from analysis (results not shown). The differences in diversity may be due to an input of C through photosynthesis and or N by N<sub>2</sub> fixation, which could indirectly select for specific heterotrophic bacteria. This is analogous to the ‘rhizosphere effect.’ The rhizosphere is the area of soil under the influence of roots. Studies have shown that the rhizosphere can select for particular microbial communities and that this selection is plant-specific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Morgan1">[66]</xref>. A similar effect may be occurring at the soil surface under light conditions. Moreover, taken with TRFLP results which show that the impact of light on bacterial community structure is restricted to the upper 3 mm of the soil surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069048-g002">Figure 2c</xref>), a new research area of microbial influence may be emerging, which we term the ‘crustosphere.’</p>
<p>TRFLP and 454 pyrosequencing revealed that light also significantly impacted fungal community structure at the soil surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069048-g002">Figure 2e</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069048-g008">8</xref>). The relatively few shifts in fungal communities could be due to the development stage of phototroph communities. BSCs typically undergo a succession from cyanobacteria- to lichen- to moss- dominated crusts in arid zones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Li3">[32]</xref>. In the present study, the soil surface was dominated by cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0069048-t002">Table 2</xref>). However, if the surface was left to develop to a lichen dominated community, more significant shifts in fungal community structure may be evident as lichen symbioses develop. However, parallels can still be drawn between soil surface fungal communities of temperate and arid lands, for example, relative composition analysis showed that Ascomycota were the dominant fungi in the present study in addition to surveys in the Colorado plateau, Chihuahuan desert and Sonoran deserts, USA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Bates1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069048-Bates2">[36]</xref>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the application of fine-scale molecular analysis gave new insights into soil surface community structure. We show differences in phototroph community structure in bulk soil in the presence of light, which have not previously been detected. We also show that the soil surface harbours distinct heterotrophic bacterial and fungal communities. Future work should focus on the ecological significance of both phototrophic and heterotrophic communities, particularly in temperate zones, including their functional importance in agro-ecosystems.</p>
