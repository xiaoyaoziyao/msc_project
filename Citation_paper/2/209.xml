<abstract>
<p>Cytosolic lipid droplets are central organelles in the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) life cycle. The viral capsid protein core localizes to lipid droplets and initiates the production of viral particles at lipid droplet–associated ER membranes. Core is thought to encapsidate newly synthesized viral RNA and, through interaction with the two envelope proteins E1 and E2, bud into the ER lumen. Here, we visualized the spatial distribution of HCV structural proteins core and E2 in vicinity of small lipid droplets by three-color 3D super-resolution microscopy. We observed and analyzed small areas of colocalization between the two structural proteins in HCV-infected cells with a diameter of approximately 100 nm that might represent putative viral assembly sites.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) persistently infects ∼180 million people worldwide and the associated morbidity and mortality are a major public health concern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Lauer1">[1]</xref>. Vaccines are not available and albeit recent advances in therapy through development of direct-acting antivirals, current treatment regimens remain very challenging. HCV is a single positive-stranded RNA virus of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family that is translated into a single polyprotein upon entry into host cells. Host and viral proteases cleave this polyprotein, releasing the 10 individual viral proteins. The structural proteins, the viral capsid core and the envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2, are the components of virions while the nonstructural proteins NS3–5B form the viral RNA replication complex. The establishment of fully permissive cell culture systems (HCVcc) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Wakita1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Lindenbach1">[3]</xref> revealed a close connection between host cell lipids and HCV replication at each step of the viral replication cycle reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Herker1">[4]</xref>. Interestingly, the cellular storage organelles of lipids, lipid droplets, emerged as putative viral assembly sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Miyanari1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Herker2">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>Two viral proteins localize to lipid droplets in the absence of full viral replication: the capsid protein core and the non-structural protein NS5A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Barba1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Shi1">[9]</xref>. Other viral proteins are found in close-proximity of lipid droplets in infected cells, but they lack intrinsic lipid droplet targeting features as they fail to localize to lipid droplets in uninfected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Camus1">[10]</xref>. Interestingly, both core and NS5A require triglyceride biosynthesis for trafficking to lipid droplets as inhibitors of diacylglycerol acyltransferase-1 (DGAT1) impair their lipid droplet localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Herker2">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Camus1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>During translation the capsid protein core is released from the polyprotein by two subsequent cleavages, which generate a 179-amino acid mature protein that is believed to migrate via lateral diffusion into ER subcompartments, to mitochondria and onto the surface of lipid droplets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Hope1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Schwer1">[13]</xref>. Core binds to lipid droplets via an amphipathic helix turn helix motif and mutations that prevent trafficking of the core protein to lipid droplets strongly inhibit virus assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Miyanari1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Boulant1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-TargettAdams1">[14]</xref>. During virus assembly, the core protein must be retrieved from the surface of lipid droplets to the site of viral budding at the opposing ER membrane and interaction between viral NS2 and NS3-4A is essential for this recruitment process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Counihan1">[15]</xref>. Colocalization of the envelope proteins with the capsid core, the prerequisite for assembly events, were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy and either not detected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Rouille1">[16]</xref>, abundant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Coller1">[17]</xref>, or limited to areas adjacent to small lipid droplets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Counihan1">[15]</xref>. However, visualizing the HCV assembly process was largely unsuccessful so far as confocal laser scanning microscopy lacks the resolution required and electron microscopic analysis is hindered by the rarity of HCV assembly processes and the heterogeneity of the viral particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Popescu1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>The major drawback of fluorescence microscopy is its limited resolution. The resolution of a microscope is limited by the diffraction barrier to approximately half of the wavelength of the emitted or diffracted light <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Abbe1">[19]</xref>. In three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy like confocal laser scanning microscopy the axial resolution is even worse than the lateral, resulting in a maximal resolution of 200 nm laterally and 500 nm axially for blue emission light <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Hell1">[20]</xref>. In recent years several microscopy techniques have been developed that overcome the diffraction limit. The most prominent approaches are stimulated emission depletion STED <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Hell2">[21]</xref>, structured illumination microscopy SIM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Gustafsson1">[22]</xref>, (fluorescence) photoactivated localization microscopy (f)PALM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Betzig1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Hess1">[24]</xref>, and (direct) stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (d)STORM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Rust1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Heilemann1">[26]</xref>. The latter, (f)PLAM, STORM, and dSTORM, have in common that their resolution improvement is based on the precise localization of single fluorescent molecules, therefore they are sometimes summed up as single molecule localization microscopy or in short localization microscopy. The maximum resolution in localization microscopy (with commercially available microscopes) is 20 nm laterally and 50 nm axially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Huang1">[27]</xref>, a tenfold resolution improvement in all three dimensions compared to confocal laser scanning microscopy. Therefore, the volume in which colocalization is detected is up to 1000× smaller in localization microscopy than in confocal microscopy resulting in much more precise colocalization analyses. The improvement in colocalozation precision has recently been shown in 2D <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Flottmann1">[28]</xref>. Localization microscopy has been used successfully to get new insights in structural details or infection processes of pathogens like bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Wang1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Han1">[30]</xref>, plant infecting fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Eggert1">[31]</xref>, and human pathogenic viruses like HIV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Pereira1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-VanEngelenburg1">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here, for the first time simultaneous three-color 3D dSTORM is employed to study a viral infection. We visualize and analyze the spatial distribution of HCV structural proteins core and E2 in vicinity of lipid droplets, the putative viral assembly site.</p>

<title>Lipid droplets can be visualized in dSTORM</title>
<p>To visualize lipid droplets and surrounding structures by super-resolution microscopy (dSTORM) we first analyzed different lipophilic fluorescent dyes (BODIPY, LipidTox Green, LipidTox Red) for their ability to blink upon excitation. Of the dyes tested, LipidTox Red showed the best properties for dSTORM on our microscope. We validated the ON and OFF switch of LipidTox Red signal over time. Shown is the signal intensity of the fluorophore over several minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102511-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). To verify that the signals detected in dSTORM represent lipid droplets we correlated widefield fluorescence microscopy of LipidTox Red stained Huh7 Lunet cells with the corresponding dSTORM image. The signals detected with each method overlapped almost completely, with the dSTORM signal usually fitting in the middle of larger signals detected by widefield microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102511-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The lipid droplets we observe in dSTORM mode are generally small (&lt;0.5 µm in diameter) as they are only detectable up to 2 µm axial distance from the coverslip. The large lipid droplets additionally observed in widefield images are mainly more than 2 µm above the coverslip (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102511.s001">Figure S1</xref>), therefore of those large lipid droplets we only detect the edge in dSTORM mode (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102511.s001">Figure S1</xref>, arrows). Lipid droplets in hepatoma cells can also be detected by staining with antibodies directed against adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP)/perilipin 2, that is strongly expressed in liver cells and associates with lipid droplets. In two-dimensional dSTORM images ADRP signals either overlapped with lipid droplets stained with LipidTox Red or tightly surrounded them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102511-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, inlays). Therefore, LipidTox Red is suitable for staining lipid droplets in dSTORM experiments.</p>

<title>Construction and validation of JFH1<sup>Flag-E2</sup> and Jc1<sup>Flag-E2</sup> infectious HCV clones</title>
<p>To study the subcellular localization of core and E2, we constructed Flag-E2-tagged variants of two infectious HCV clones, the original isolate that replicates in cultured hepatoma cells (JFH1), and a genotype 2a/2a chimera (Jc1) that produces high titers of infectious particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102511-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). To produce infectious HCVcc particles, Huh7.5 cells were transfected with <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed viral RNA and expression of the viral proteins core and Flag-E2 was verified by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102511-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).

<title>Confocal microscopy of JFH1<sup>Flag-E2</sup>- and Jc1<sup>Flag-E2</sup>-infected cells</title>
<p>Infected cells were then processed for immunostaining with antibodies directed against Flag (E2) and core. Previously it has been suggested that different permeabilization methods might influence lipid droplet localization of select lipid droplet binding proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Ohsaki1">[36]</xref>. Therefore, we compared two different permeabilization methods, 5 min 0.1% Triton X-100 vs. 5 min 0.5% saponin and addition of 0.1% saponin to the antibody staining solutions. Following the incubation with primary and secondary antibodies, cells were stained with LipidTox Red to visualize lipid droplets and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Signal intensities of core were stronger in JFH1<sup>Flag-E2</sup>- than in Jc1<sup>Flag-E2</sup>-infected cells with core partially localizing to lipid droplets Jc1<sup>Flag-E2</sup>-infected cells and tightly surrounding larger lipid droplets in JFH1<sup>Flag-E2</sup>-infected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102511.s002">figure S2</xref>). Flag-E2 displayed a predominantly reticular localization and partial colocalization with core at lipid droplets. We measured the degree of colocalization between the two viral proteins according to Manders. The Manders overlap coefficient indicates the portion of the intensity in each channel that overlaps with some intensity in the other channel and is accordingly calculated for each fluorophore. Flag-E2 partially colocalized with core (M1(Jc1<sup>Flag-E2</sup>) = 0.31±0.15, M1(JFH1<sup>Flag-E2</sup>) = 0.45±0.14), while most of core colocalized with Flag-E2 (M2(Jc1<sup>Flag-E2</sup>) = 0.97±0.04, M2(JFH1<sup>Flag-E2</sup>) = 0.87±0.17). We did not observe statistically significant differences in colocalization of core with Flag-E2 between the two viral strains. In our hands both permeabilization methods yielded similar results in confocal microscopy, although permeabilization with Triton X-100 resulted in stronger fluorescence signals than permeabilization with saponin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102511.s002">figure S2</xref>).</p>

<title>Super-resolution microscopy of Jc1<sup>Flag-E2</sup>- and JFH1<sup>Flag-E2</sup>-infected cells</title>
<p>Super-resolution datasets were then acquired on a custom modified Nikon N-STORM microscope in dSTORM mode <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Heilemann1">[26]</xref>. For 3D dSTORM we used astigmatism imaging as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Huang1">[27]</xref>. Super-resolution images were reconstructed from a series of 10,000–15,000 widefield images per channel using the N-STORM v. 2.0 module of NIS Elements AR v. 4.0. (Nikon). We next defined cytosolic regions of interests (ROIs) that were reconstructed in 3D with the axial position information encoded according to the color-coded bar. Shown are example ROIs of 3 independent experiments with Triton X-100–permeabilized and one experiment with saponin-permeabilized cells of Huh7 Lunet cells infected either with Jc1<sup>Flag-E2</sup> or JFH1<sup>Flag-E2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102511-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102511.s003">Figures S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102511.s004">S4</xref>). For each ROI the projected 2D image and the merge as well as the color-coded 3D image are shown. Core staining was generally confined to more distinct areas than the Flag-E2 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102511-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102511.s003">Figures S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102511.s004">S4</xref>). Lipid droplets appeared as tight round spots when located close to the coverslip but displayed more scattered signal distribution when further apart from the coverslip, which usually represents the edge of larger droplets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102511.s001">Figure S1</xref>). When we compared the two viral strains or the two different permeabilization methods we could not detect any obvious differences. To determine if there are differences in the degree of colocalization of the viral proteins between the two viral strains we calculated the degree of colocalization according to Manders (measuring the portion of the intensity in each channel that coincides with some intensity in the other channel). Overall colocalization coefficients were very low reflecting the high resolution of the dSTORM images. While the levels of colocalization of core with lipid droplets and colocalization of Flag-E2 with core were similar in both viral strains, Flag-E2 displayed slightly less colocalization with lipid droplets in JFH1<sup>Flag-E2</sup>- versus Jc1<sup>Flag-E2</sup>-infected cells, indicating more efficient recruitment of Flag-E2 protein to lipid droplets in cells infected with a viral strain that produces higher titers of progeny virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102511-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

Lipid droplet localization was scored as follows: A) core and Flag-E2 adjacent to lipid droplets, B) Flag-E2 adjacent to core, core adjacent to lipid droplets, and C) core adjacent to Flag-E2, Flag-E2 adjacent to lipid droplets. Furthermore, the degree of colocalization between the viral proteins was scored as I) complete, II) partial, or III) no colocalization. Analysis of the colocalization between core and Flag-E2 in the area surrounding lipid droplets revealed that in Jc1<sup>Flag-E2</sup>-infected cells there is only at around 30% of the lipid droplets a partial colocalization. In contrast, in JFH1<sup>Flag-E2</sup>-infected cells approximately 70% of the lipid droplets showed colocalization, with ∼10% of lipid droplet surrounding areas showing complete colocalization between core and Flag-E2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102511-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Additionally, in both Jc1<sup>Flag-E2</sup>- and JFH1<sup>Flag-E2</sup>-infected cells core was adjacent to lipid droplets in 70–80% of the analyzed lipid droplets, with Flag-E2 co-coating lipid droplets in 50% (Jc1<sup>Flag-E2</sup>) and 80% (JFH1<sup>Flag-E2</sup>) of the cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102511-g004">Figure 4</xref>). So even though more Flag-E2 is recruited to the sites of viral assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102511-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), when analyzing individual lipid droplets in 3D less lipid droplets are surrounded by colocalizing core and Flag-E2 proteins.</p>

<title>Analysis of the 3D distribution and colocalization of the viral proteins at lipid droplets.</title>
<p>dSTORM datasets were analyzed for the distribution and colocalization of core and Flag-E2. Cytosolic regions of interest were reconstructed in 3D and lipid droplets with core and Flag-E2 staining in close proximity were analyzed as follows: lipid droplet localization was scored A) core and Flag-E2 adjacent to lipid droplets, B) Flag-E2 adjacent to core, core adjacent to lipid droplets, and C) core adjacent to Flag-E2, Flag-E2 adjacent to lipid droplets. The degree of colocalization between the viral proteins was scored as I) complete, II) partial, or III) no colocalization. We analyzed reconstructed images from three independent experiments of Triton X-100–permeabilized cells and one experiment of saponin-permeabilized cells with a total amount of 40 lipid droplets in Jc1<sup>Flag-E2</sup>-infected cells and 36 lipid droplets in JFH1<sup>Flag-E2</sup>-infected cells. Colocalization and localization relative to lipid droplets was significantly different between cells infected with the two viral strains (*<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, **<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, chi-square test).</p>

<p>In Jc1<sup>Flag-E2</sup>-infected cells core usually was found in distinct spots adjacent to the lipid droplet volume sometimes partially colocalizing with Flag-E2 or on opposing sites of the lipid droplet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102511-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The volumes of colocalization were usually around or below 100 nm in diameter. In contrast, in JFH1<sup>Flag-E2</sup>-infected cells core occupied more space in the areas surrounding lipid droplets and the colocalization volumes with Flag-E2 were larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102511-g006">Figure 6</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we performed simultaneous super-resolution microscopy of two viral proteins (core and E2) together with lipid droplets in 3D. We first identified a lipophilic dye suitable for dSTORM imaging and validated the staining with antibodies directed against a lipid droplet-binding protein. To achieve a photoblinking of the fluorophores that was suited for dSTORM the TIRF angle was adjusted to oblique incidence excitation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Dempsey1">[37]</xref>. In this case a thickness of 1–2 µm of the sample is illuminated with maximum light intensity facilitating the blinking of the fluorophores. We observed that within this distance lipid droplets are generally small (0.2–0.5 µm in diameter). In corresponding widefield images larger droplets that are above this area are also visible. Edges of these larger droplets could be detected in dSTORM mode indicated by a scattered staining pattern just below the maximal distance from the coverslip. Well-resolved lipid droplets generally appeared as round to oval shaped objects.</p>
<p>We then analyzed the spatial distribution of core and Flag-E2 of two viral strains (Jc1<sup>Flag-E2</sup> vs JFH1<sup>Flag-E2</sup>) that differ in the amount of progeny virions they produce. As lipid droplets are the putative assembly sites of HCV we hypothesized to observe distinct differences in the distribution of core and Flag-E2 (as structural proteins they are components of the progeny virions). As noted above we could only analyze rather small lipid droplets, but it has been suggested by confocal microscopic analyses and live cell imaging that these small lipid droplets may represent viral assembly sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Counihan1">[15]</xref>. We reconstructed and analyzed the 3D distribution in four independent experiments of cells permeabilized with two different methods. Staining patterns and colocalization events were similar when cells were permeabilized with Triton X-100 or saponin. Over all images acquired, slightly more Flag-E2 colocalizes with lipid droplets in Jc1<sup>Flag-E2</sup> -infected cells indicating that the recruitment process of the envelope proteins to the putative sites of assembly is more efficient in cells infected with a strain capable of efficient progeny virus production. All other colocalization analyses did not reveal any significant differences.</p>
<p>We next focused our analysis on lipid droplets that had both viral proteins present in close proximity. As noted above colocalization events in projected 2D images were rather infrequent. It has recently been shown that the amount of colocalization decreases in dSTORM compared to confocal microscopy due to the improved resolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102511-Flottmann1">[28]</xref>. In line with these results, when we analyzed the spatial distribution in 3D only very small areas of colocalization volumes were observed. In addition, the frequency of such core Flag-E2 colocalization events in cells was very low, which could reflect the low number of assembly events in HCV-infected cells. We observed even less colocalization of the capsid protein core with the envelope E2 in cells that produce higher amounts of progeny virions, indicating that assembled virions are transported from the site of assembly or that in the absence of viral assembly, core accumulates and colocalizes with Flag-E2. The volumes of colocalization in Jc1<sup>Flag-E2</sup>-infected cells are generally very tiny, with only around 100 nm in diameter. Within these volumes of colocalization we could not resolve any specific distribution pattern as we are very close to the limit of resolution. In addition, colocalization events were so rare that we could not average the localization of the proteins across colocalization areas of different lipid droplets.</p>
<p>The limitations of our approach are that we can only analyze the space of 2 µm above the coverslip and are therefore unable to analyze the bigger droplets that are, at least in JFH1-infected cells, completely core-coated when analyzed by confocal microscopy. However, the methodology could, combined with correlative electron microscopy, enable finding putative HCV assembly sites in cells by dSTORM, defined through the presence of colocalizing core and Flag-E2 volumes, and thus facilitate analysis of relevant areas in electron microscopy.</p>
