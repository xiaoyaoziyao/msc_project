<title>Background</title>
<p>Clinical trials have shown that treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes with pioglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ agonist, reduces cardiovascular events. However, the effect of PPARγ agonists on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that plays an important role in the progression of atherosclerosis has not been determined. We sought to determine the effect of PPARγ agonists on ER stress induced by palmitate, the most abundant saturated fatty acid in the serum.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methods and Results</title>
<p>Protein expression of ER stress marker was evaluated by Western blot analysis and stearoyl-CoA desaturase1 (SCD-1) mRNA expression was evaluated by qRT-PCR. Macrophage apoptosis was detected by flowcytometry. Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone reduced palmitate-induced phosphorylation of PERK, a marker of ER stress, in RAW264.7, a murine macrophage cell line. Pioglitazone also suppressed palmitate-induced apoptosis in association with inhibition of CHOP expression, JNK phosphorylation and cleavage of caspase-3. These effects of pioglitazone were reversed by GW9662, a PPARγ antagonist, indicating that PPARγ is involved in this process. PPARγ agonists increased expression of SCD-1 that introduces a double bond on the acyl chain of long-chain fatty acid. 4-(2-Chlorophenoxy)-N-(3-(3-methylcarbamoyl)phenyl)piperidine-1-carboxamide, an inhibitor of SCD-1, abolished the anti-ER stress and anti-apoptotic effects of pioglitazone. These results suggest that PPARγ agonists attenuate palmitate-induced ER stress and apoptosis through SCD-1 induction. Up-regulation of SCD-1 may contribute to the reduction of cardiovascular events by treatment with PPARγ agonists.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an important organelle required for cell survival and normal cellular function, such as regulation of protein synthesis, appropriate folding of protein, and calcium storage. Various insults including ischemia, hypoxia and a high-fat diet induce accumulation of unfolded proteins in ER, which is designated ER stress [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In response to ER stress, the unfolded protein response (UPR) occurs to avoid apoptosis. The UPR consists of three main signaling systems initiated by three ER localized stress sensors such as PERK, IRE1 and ATF6. These molecular transduction systems attempt to maintain protein folding capacity and prevent a buildup of unproductive or toxic misfolded proteins. However, severe or prolonged ER stress can trigger apoptosis, which is promoted by transcriptional induction of CHOP/GADD153, activation of c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK), and caspase-dependent pathways [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
<p>Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease and the leading cause of death in developed countries. ER stress and UPR activation are markedly increased in all stages of atherosclerotic lesions in an animal model and human atherosclerotic lesion [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128546.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Macrophage apoptosis also occurs various stages of atherosclerosis. Apoptosis of macrophage occurs in macrophage-rich regions and cleared safely in early atherosclerotic lesions, which is associated with smaller lesion size [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128546.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, recent studies suggest that macrophage apoptosis induced by severe or prolonged ER stress is one of the critical mechanisms that induce vulnerability of the atherosclerosis plaque [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It has been reported that Fabp4 deficiency-induced LXRα up-regulation in macrophage resulted in an increase in the activity of stearoyl CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1), an enzyme that converts endogenous saturated fatty acids (SFA) to monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and thereby reduced ER stress and atherosclerosis [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Because peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ agonists have been reported to increase expression of LXRα and ABCA1 and attenuate atherosclerosis [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], we hypothesized that thiazolidinediones (TZD), synthetic PPARγ agonists, may attenuate ER stress induced by SFA through up-regulation of SCD-1. We showed in the present study that pioglitazone, one of TZDs attenuates ER stress and apoptosis in macrophage induced by palmitate, the most abundant SFA in the serum through up-regulation of SCD-1.These results suggest that reduction of SFA level may contribute anti-atherosclerotic effects of pioglitazone.</p>

<title>Palmitate induced ER stress and activated apoptotic signalling pathways</title>
<p>To determine whether SFA induces ER stress in macrophage, we examined the effect of palmitate, the most abundant SFA in the serum, on phosphorylation of PERK in RAW264.7cells. Treatment with palmitate induced PERK phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="pone.0128546.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Upon exposure to severe or prolonged ER stress, the PERK and IRE1 signalling pathways induce transcription and translation of proapoptotic factors such as CHOP and activate JNK pathway. This also results in caspase activation. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0128546.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B–1D</xref>, palmitate induced CHOP expression, JNK phosphorylation and cleavage of caspase-3 in a dose-dependent manner. To confirm that the ER stress is specifically induced by saturated fatty acid, we examined the effect of palmitoleate, a mono-unsaturated fatty acid, on ER stress (<xref rid="pone.0128546.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). Palmitoleate failed to induce PERK phosphorylation, suggesting that saturated fatty acid may specifically induce ER stress.</p>

<title>Thiazolidinediones attenuated palmitate-induced ER stress and apoptotic signalling pathways</title>
<p>Palmitate has been shown to induce ER stress and apoptosis in many cell types at concentrations between 250 μmol/L and 500 μmol/L [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128546.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Because phosphorylation of PERK and JNK, expression of CHOP and cleavage of caspase-3 were significantly activated at 400 μmol/L of palmitate, we treated RAW264.7 cells with palmitate at a concentration of 400 μmol/L in the following experiments. The effects of vehicle (DMSO), pioglitazone (10 μmol/L) or rosiglitazone (10 μmol/L), another TZDs, on palmitate-induced ER stress and apoptotic signaling pathways were examined in RAW264.7 cells. Western blot analysis revealed that TZDs significantly inhibited palmitate-induced PERK phosphorylation, CHOP expression, JNK phosphorylation and cleavage of caspase-3 (<xref rid="pone.0128546.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A–2D</xref>). It is suggested that anti-ER stress effects are mediated by PPARγ activation, because rosiglitazone showed the same anti-ER stress effects as pioglitazone. We, therefore, focused on pioglitazone in the following experiments.</p>

<title>Pioglitazone increased SCD-1 mRNA level in macrophage</title>
<p>We investigated whether pioglitazone modulates expression of SCD-1 in RAW264.7 cells. Palmitate slightly decreased SCD-1 mRNA level. Pretreatment with pioglitazone resulted in a significant increase in SCD-1 mRNA level in the presence or absence of palmitate (<xref rid="pone.0128546.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). There was no change in LXRα mRNA level after treatment with palmitate and/or pioglitazone in RAW264.7 cells (<xref rid="pone.0128546.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). However, the expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1, target genes of LXRα, was up-regulated by pioglitazone treatment (<xref rid="pone.0128546.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>). These data suggest that LXRα pathway is activated by pioglitazone.</p>

<title>SCD-1 inhibition blocked anti-ER stress and anti-apoptotic effects of pioglitazone</title>
<p>Finally, to determine the role of SCD-1 in palmitate–induced ER stress and apoptosis, we assessed the effect of an inhibitor of SCD-1. Suppression of phosphorylation of PERK and JNK, CHOP expression, and cleavage of caspase-3 by pioglitazone was reversed by an SCD-1 inhibitor in a dose-dependent manner in RAW264.7 cells (<xref rid="pone.0128546.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A–5D</xref>). The same result was obtained in peritoneal macrophages in terms of PERK phosphorylation (<xref rid="pone.0128546.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>). We also examined whether pioglitazone attenuates palmitate-induced macrophage apoptosis. Annexin V specifically binds to phosphatidylserines that are exposed at the cell surface in the preapoptotic stage. Staining with PI indicates dead cells. The number of RAW264.7 cells stained positively with Annexin V–FITC and negatively with PI was increased by incubation with palmitate and significantly reduced by pretreatment with pioglitazone. Reduced apoptosis by pioglitazone was reversed by inhibitor of SCD-1(<xref rid="pone.0128546.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>). These data suggest that anti-ER stress and anti-apoptotic effects of pioglitazone may be mediated by SCD-1 up-regulation. We examined the effect of CAY10566, another SCD-1 inhibitor [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], on pioglitazone suppression of PERK phosphorylation. CAY10566 also reversed PERK phosphorylation suppressed by pioglitazone, indicating that the amelioration of ER stress by pioglitazone was mediated by SCD-1 pathway (<xref rid="pone.0128546.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>). We examined the effects of SCD-1 inhibitor and CAY10566 on PERK phosphorylation and cleavage of caspase 3 at the baseline. SCD-1 inhibitor did not show any effect on PERK phosphorylation and cleavage of caspase 3. However, CAY10566 slightly induced PERK phosphorylation and cleavage of caspase 3(<xref rid="pone.0128546.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5G and 5H</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although the previous studies suggest that PPARγ agonists increase cholesterol efflux from macrophages and decrease cytokine expression, its involvement in ER stress has not been studied well. We demonstrated in the present study that PPARγ agonists attenuated palmitate-induced ER stress and apoptosis in macrophages. Furthermore, we showed that pioglitazone-induced marked resistance to ER stress and apoptosis is dependent on SCD-1. To our knowledge, we firstly reported that PPARγ agonists attenuated SFA-induced ER stress and apoptosis in macrophage.</p>
<p>Dietary SFAs have been implicated in promoting the metabolic syndrome and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It has been reported that SFAs have lipotoxic effects leading to ER stress and apoptosis in many cell types [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128546.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. On the other hand, MUFAs appear less toxic and can reduce SFA-induced ER stress [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. SCD-1 plays a key role in preventing lipotoxic effects of SFAs, as it converts lipotoxic SFAs to less toxic MUFAs. It has been reported that upregulation of SCD-1 prevents ER stress in endothelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], whereas knockdown of SCD-1 enhanced palmitate-induced ER stress in insulin secreting cells [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. SCD-1 deficiency increased atherosclerotic lesion in low-density-lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) knockout mice with an increase in plasma ICAM-1 and IL-6 levels [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It was also reported that antisense oligonucleotide for SCD-1 accelerates atherogenesis in LDLR-deficient mice [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Based on these reports, it is suggested that the mechanism by which PPARγ agonists stabilize atherosclerotic plaque may partially result from reducing ER stress through up-regulation of SCD-1.</p>
<p>Although statistically insignificant, palmitate suppressed SCD1, ABCA1 and ABCG1 mRNA levels. We did not examine the signaling pathway of palmitate in this study. However, it is suggested that palmitate activates toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. And previous studies showed that lipopolysaccharide, another ligand for TLR4, suppressed expression of ABCA1 [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and ABCG1 [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] in macrophages. Therefore, it is possible that down-regulation of these genes may be due to activation of TLR4 by palmitate.</p>
<p>However, the effect of PPARγ agonists on ER stress seems to be controversial. Pioglitazone improved pancreatic islet function such as insulin release in diabetic mice through reduction of ER stress [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Pioglitazone also reduced ER stress in the liver of diabetic mice [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Whereas 15-deoxy-Δ<sup>12,14</sup>-prostaglandin J<sub>2</sub>, another PPARγ agonist, activated expression of unfolded protein response-responsive genes [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. TZD18, a PPARγ/δ dual ligand, activated ER stress response and induced growth arrest and apoptosis in breast cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The mechanism for the differential response to PPAR agonist is not clear. Diabetic mice were treated with pioglitazone and ER stress was examined in vivo in the former 2 studies, in which showed that PPARγ reduced ER stress [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128546.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In contrast, other 2 studies showing that PPARγ induced ER stress [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128546.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] examined the effects of PPARγ agonists on cells derived from tumors such as RINm5F cell line derived from rat insulinoma and breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. Therefore, it may be possible to assume that the effect of PPARγ agonists on ER stress may be dependent on the stimuli that induce ER stress and cell or tissue type. Alternatively, different PPARγ agonist may show differential effects on ER stress, although we showed that pioglitazone and rosiglitazone have the same effects on palmitate-induced ER stress so far as we examined.</p>
<p>It was reported that the <italic>Fabp4</italic>-deficient macrophages showed a marked increase in SCD-1 and LXR activity [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. SCD-1 is known to be one of the target molecules of LXR [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Although pioglitazone did not increase LXRα mRNA levels, expression of target genes of LXRα such as ABCA1 and ABCG1 was increased, indicating that LXR pathway is activated. Therefore, we could not exclude the role of LXR in the pioglitazone-induced upregulation of SCD-1 at this point. It is reasonable, however, to assume that both LXR and PPARγ contribute to pioglitazone-induced up-regulation of SCD1 gene, because PPARγ response element is present in the SCD1 gene promoter [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and a LXR agonist such as TO-901317 was reported to induce SCD1 expression [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
<p>Although a previous report showed that a putative PPAR response element is located in the SCD-1 gene promoter [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], the effect of TZDs on SCD-1 expression is controversial. It was reported that TZDs suppress SCD-1 expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Hepatic SCD-1 expression was not affected by pioglitazone in obese Zucher fa/fa rats [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, SCD-1 mRNA expression in adipose tissue from subjects with type 2 diabetes was increased after treatment with rosiglitazone [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It is difficult to reconcile these contradicting results, but it is possible that the effect of TZDs on SCD-1 expression may be species- or tissue-dependent as the effect of TZDs on ER stress is not consistent.</p>
<p>Two inhibitors of SCD1 showed differential effects on basal PERK phosphorylation and Caspase3 cleavage (<xref rid="pone.0128546.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5G and 5H</xref>). A previous report showed that CAY10566 induced phosphorylation of ATF4, the transcription factor downstream of the PERK pathway, and production of CHOP in VSMC [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Although the reason for this differential effect is not immediately clear, it was suggested that basal SCD-1 activity may play some role in the reduction of ER stress.</p>
<p>Macrophage death plays Janus-faced roles in atherogenesis. Several studies have shown that macrophage apoptosis in early atherosclerotic lesions is associated with smaller lesion size and less plaque progression [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This phenomenon is explained by an efficient removal of apoptotic cells by neighboring macrophages. In contrast, macrophage death is reported to promote plaque necrosis in advanced atherosclerotic lesions, in which ER stress of macrophage is believed to play a critical role. For example, macrophage apoptosis and plaque necrosis were reduced in CHOP-deficient apolipoprotein E knockout mice [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>
<p>A previous study showed that pioglitazone reduced cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0128546.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The result is consistent with the idea that macrophage apoptosis induces plaque vulnerability and pioglitazone reduces macrophage apoptosis through attenuation of ER stress, which was shown in this study. However, it has not been determined whether pioglitazone up-regulates macrophage SCD-1 and suppresses apoptosis in vivo. Further studies are needed.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we showed in the present study that PPARγ agonists attenuated palmitate-induced macrophage ER stress and apoptosis. These effects depend on SCD-1 that may modulate fatty acid profile in macrophage, and partially contribute to the plaque stability in atherosclerotic lesion.</p>
