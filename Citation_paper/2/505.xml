          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Accurate analyses of microbiota composition of low-density communities (10<sup>3</sup>–10<sup>4</sup> bacteria/sample) can be challenging. Background DNA from chemicals and consumables, extraction biases as well as differences in PCR efficiency can significantly interfere with microbiota assessment. This study was aiming to establish protocols for accurate microbiota analysis at low microbial density.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>To examine possible effects of bacterial density on microbiota analyses we compared microbiota profiles of serial diluted saliva and low (nares, nasopharynx) and high-density (oropharynx) upper airway communities in four healthy individuals. DNA was extracted with four different extraction methods (Epicentre Masterpure, Qiagen DNeasy, Mobio Powersoil and a phenol bead-beating protocol combined with Agowa-Mag-mini). Bacterial DNA recovery was analysed by 16S qPCR and microbiota profiles through GS-FLX-Titanium-Sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons spanning the V5–V7 regions.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Lower template concentrations significantly impacted microbiota profiling results. With higher dilutions, low abundant species were overrepresented. In samples of &lt;10<sup>5</sup> bacteria per ml, <italic>e.g.</italic> DNA &lt;1 pg/µl, microbiota profiling deviated from the original sample and other dilutions showing a significant increase in the taxa Proteobacteria and decrease in Bacteroidetes. In similar low density samples, DNA extraction method determined if DNA levels were below or above 1 pg/µl and, together with lysis preferences per method, had profound impact on microbiota analyses in both relative abundance as well as representation of species.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>This study aimed to interpret microbiota analyses of low-density communities. Bacterial density seemed to interfere with microbiota analyses at &lt; than 10<sup>6</sup> bacteria per ml or DNA &lt;1 pg/µl. We therefore recommend this threshold for working with low density materials. This study underlines that bias reduction is crucial for adequate profiling of especially low-density bacterial communities.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Deep sequencing techniques allow for detailed analyses of microbial communities that occupy skin and various mucosal sites of the human body and exploration of their potential role in health and disease. Bacterial composition differs greatly between body sites and between individuals, depending on host and environmental parameters such as nutrient availability, humidity, mucosal structure and immune status <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032942-Costello1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032942-Dethlefsen1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032942-Peterson1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032942-Spor1">[4]</xref>. Not only microbial composition and dynamics but also community density varies greatly per site, e.g. 10<sup>11</sup>–10<sup>12</sup> bacteria/g in fecal material <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032942-Salonen1">[5]</xref> to only 10<sup>4</sup>–10<sup>5</sup> bacteria/cm<sup>2</sup> in the nasopharyngeal region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032942-Bogaert1">[6]</xref>. Bacterial density is important for quorum sensing and cross talk between bacteria, in which it determines differential gene regulation and subsequent the particular behavior of bacteria. By this cross-communication bacteria can regulate virulence factor production and metabolic demands of the community they live in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032942-Parker1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032942-Boyer1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The upper airway is the port d'entrée for infections and insight into microbial community structures in these sites could contribute to our understanding of pathogenesis of respiratory infections. Most of these niches, such as the nasopharynx, are colonized at low density. Furthermore, individuals can vary greatly in colonization density of the same niche, possibly reflecting physicochemical differences. For comprehensive and accurate insight in the microbiota of these low-density regions, and inter-individual comparison, understanding the effect of low bacterial 16S gene template concentrations on deep sequencing analyses is relevant, especially since most studies have been focusing on bacterial habitats, where bacterial density, composition and diversity is different from these habitats e.g. gut microbiota <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032942-Salonen1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032942-Wu1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032942-Wu2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032942-Zoetendal1">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We therefore studied the effect of bacterial density on microbiota analyses by 16S rDNA pyrosequencing of serially diluted saliva. To adjust for possible DNA extraction biases, we extracted DNA by four commonly used DNA extraction methods. To be able to extrapolate the dilution results to the natural situation we compared 16S rDNA gene pyrosequencing-based results for low-density (nares, nasopharynx) and high-density communities (saliva, oropharynx) of the upper respiratory tract of four healthy individuals.</p>

        <title>Bacterial density in nasopharyngeal samples</title>
        <p>During a vaccine intervention trial, nasopharyngeal swabs were collected in 1003 infants during the first 24 months of their life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032942-vanGils1">[12]</xref>. This sample collection enabled us to gain insight in the dynamics of nasopharyngeal microbiota composition in relation to pneumococcal vaccination and other epidemiological factors. However, to enable analysis of the temporal dynamics of the nasopharyngeal microbiota, unbiased microbiome analysis of the swab collection is essential. In a previous reported study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032942-Bogaert1">[6]</xref> 16SrDNA levels of 154 randomly selected nasopharyngeal swabs of this collection ranged between &lt;0.5 pg/µl to o.12 ng/µl with an average of 7.4 pg/µl (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0032942.s001">Figure S1</xref>). In 45% of samples, DNA levels were between 1 and 10 pg/µl , in 35% less than 1 pg/µl and 19% above 10 pg/µl. Although symptoms of a common cold appeared to be associated with higher DNA levels in the swabs (data not shown), we were not able to identify this or other biological factors attributing to the large variation in DNA content, although differences in sampling efficiency may play a role. These results, however, prompted us to investigate the effects of DNA template concentration on accurate 16 s rDNA microbiota profiling and to establish a protocol to correctly assess these low abundant regions taking into account possible interfering biases due to technical analyses.</p>

        <title>Effect of bacterial density on microbiota composition</title>
        <p>To elucidate the effect of bacterial density on the comparability of 454 prosequencing analyses, we designed a titration experiment using saliva from one person with known bacterial cell density of 10<sup>9</sup> and made a dilution series corresponding to 10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> bacteria per ml (named dilution 1 to 3 respectively, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0032942-t001">table 1</xref>). From each sample, DNA was extracted by four different extraction methods e.g. Epicentre Masterpure DNA purification kit, Qiagen DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit, MoBio PowerSoil DNA Extraction Kit or a phenol/bead beating method combined with the Agowa Mag mini DNA extraction kit, hereafter referred to as Epicentre, Qiagen, Mobio and Agowa respectively. Using these four extraction methods reduced the potential bias introduced by mechanism of lysis or DNA capturing. The microbiota of the samples was subsequently analysed by 16srDNA pyrosequening.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, samples diluted below a level of 10<sup>6</sup> bacteria per ml (dilution 3, overall DNA template below 1 pg/µl) displayed a clear shift in unweighted UniFrac distance, suggesting significant impact on species composition (Amova &lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032942-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>). Bacterial sample concentration corresponded to 30.97% of the variation in distance seen between samples (PcoA loading axis 1), mostly due to dilution 3 samples. In line with this shift in distance, microbiota profiles of dilution 3 showed significant increase in relative abundance of Proteobacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032942-g002">Figure 2</xref>, ANOVA p&lt;0.001) and significant decrease in Bacteroidetes (ANOVA p&lt;0.001) compared to undiluted saliva. For all methods except Mobio, diversity increased in samples below 10<sup>6</sup> bacteria per ml compared to undiluted saliva (Shannon diversity: mean 3.29 versus 2.79, (stdev 0.15 and 0.14), Simpson index: mean 0.08 versus 0.14 (stdev 0.02 and 0,007) for dilution 3 samples versus undiluted saliva respectively, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0032942-t001">table 1</xref>). This increase in diversity was mostly reflected in an increase in low abundant genera and unique sequences apparently not present in the original saliva sample. To test this, we combined all sequence data of the undiluted and dilution 1 and 2 samples (excluding Mobio dilution 1 and 2) considering a total of 61.057 raw sequences and concluded that in this large pool of sequences we did not observe the majority of low abundant genera found in the highly diluted samples suggesting an external source of origin. Most of these low abundant sequences corresponded to the taxon Proteobacteria.</p>

        <title>Effect of bacterial density in upper airway niches</title>
        <p>To extrapolate the results of the salivary dilution experiments to human low-density niches we obtained samples from two low-density communities: nares and nasopharynx (0.1–10 pg/µl, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0032942.s007">table S1</xref>) of four healthy adult volunteers. For each sample DNA was extracted by four different methods, and the microbiota analysed by 16srDNA 454 pyrosequencing.</p>
        <p>Analysis of the microbiota community structure of low-density nares and nasopharynx samples revealed apparent grouping of samples in which template concentration was less than 1 pg/µl and those in which template concentration was higher than 1 pg/µl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032942-g003">Figure 3a</xref>). In line with the saliva dilution experiments, significantly higher levels of Proteobacteria were found in the samples with less than 1 pg/µl compared to identical samples extracted with higher yields and at template levels above this threshold (ANOVA p&lt;0.001, mean 22.2 and 11.09%, stdev 23.03 and 15.36% respectively). The relative abundance of Bacteroidetes was however not significantly reduced below this threshold as was found in the dilution experiment. It is important to note that the differences in template concentration were due to differences in DNA extraction efficiency between used methods. So, despite clear correlation between DNA level and microbiota analyses, effects were fully tied to differences in DNA extraction methodology.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Human habitats contain unique bacterial communities at different density depending on the habitat structure and community function. The upper airways are colonized with bacterial communities at low density, including the nasopharynx and nares, as was illustrated in the manuscript. These bacterial communities however contain potential respiratory pathogens, but also act as first-line defense against overgrowth and invasion of those pathogens leading to respiratory infections. To study these important microbiota, accurate processing for sequencing and potential limitations for working with these materials should be understood. In this study we show the effect of bacterial density on microbiota analyses by using serially diluted saliva samples and samples from low density (nares and nasopharynx) communities of the upper respiratory tract to identify potential limitations and biases on microbiota analyses.</p>
      <p>By diluting a given sample, we expected low abundant genera to disappear first from the profiles as the effect of subsequent reduction in taxa richness, as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032942-Wu2">[10]</xref>. Interestingly however, for all dilutions, sequences affiliated to ‘low abundant’ genera (mostly Firmicutes) increased whereas those affiliated to ‘high abundant’ genera (mostly Bacteroidetes) decreased. This phenomenon might be explained by changes in 16S amplification efficiency due to minor differences in nucleotide composition of the primer sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032942-Hayward1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032942-Polz1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032942-Sipos1">[15]</xref>. Highest melting temperature (Tm), presumably positively affecting hybridization efficiency, was found for both forward (+2°C) and reverse (+0.8°C) primer sequences of the Firmicute <italic>Veillonella</italic> compared to both <italic>Prevotella</italic> (decreased in abundance) and <italic>Streptococcae</italic> (sustained in abundance). This could potentially explain the increase in abundance found for this genus in diluted samples, though not for other genera. Therefore, additional mechanisms must contribute to this phenomenon. Despite these differences in abundance, bacterial representation in the undiluted saliva sample and diluted samples up to a density of 10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> bacteria per ml was highly in concordance.</p>
      <p>In contrast, at a density of &lt;10<sup>6</sup> bacteria per ml and DNA &lt;1 pg/µl of template we observed clear shifts in microbiota profiles for all DNA extraction methods. Not only relative abundance of bacteria changed, but also bacterial representation was affected by diluting, with an apparent loss of certain bacterial species present in the original sample. Moreover, detection of (low abundant) species, mostly proteobacteria, not present in the original samples was observed. To be able to exclude a lack of sensitivity in analyses of the undiluted samples with respect to those newly observed in diluted samples, we pooled all sequences of the undiluted and diluted samples with densities of 10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> bacteria per ml (61.057 sequences) and still did not observe most of the genera that increased at this density. The fact, however, that a similar increase in OTUs was observed in the (undiluted) samples &lt;1 pg/µl from both the nares and nasopharynx but not the ones above this threshold strongly supports the validity of this finding. Although we can't rule out that these low abundant OTUs in samples &lt;1 pg/µl could still be a true reflection of diversity of the microbiome, more likely background contamination from chemicals and solutions used prior to amplicon preparation could have introduced these genera, which is in line with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032942-Corless1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032942-Muhl1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032942-Tanner1">[18]</xref>. Also in line with our results, Tanner et al. found that most of the contaminant rDNA sequences from negative extraction controls belonged to the phylum Proteobacteria. Furthermore he reports that many of the clones they obtained from the negative extraction controls were closely related to sequences recovered from environmental samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032942-Tanner1">[18]</xref>. Many of the betaproteobacteria are found in wastewater and soil environments and can therefore easily contaminate chemicals and solutions used for DNA extraction. In especially low-density samples, DNA levels are not high enough to overrule contaminant DNA in the analyses and may therefore cause the observed shifts in microbiota profiles in samples below 10<sup>6</sup> bacteria per ml. We therefore recommend based on these results a lower bacterial density threshold of 10<sup>6</sup> bacteria per ml and template DNA of 1 pg/µl.</p>
      <p>In this study we didn't test for methods to reduce background DNA. Development of effective and efficient decontamination methods also suitable for high-throughput use or development of ultrapure reagents could potentially further reduce background DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032942-Corless1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032942-Klaschik1">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, this study was performed on samples from different niches of the upper respiratory and oral tract. Therefore, applying our findings to other niches should be approached with caution. However, taking into account the clear shifts at the density level at 10<sup>5</sup> bacteria per ml and DNA &lt;1 pg/µl of template, we expect these shifts will also occur in other types of communities depending on density.</p>
      <p>In low density samples, DNA extraction method determined if DNA levels of similar samples were below or above the DNA template threshold of 1 pg/µl. The ability to capture DNA efficiently in these samples is therefore of importance. In that context we studied what extraction method was best in both efficient and representative DNA recovery. Considering that at low density, effects of lysis preference per method intertwined with low DNA template-induced effects, we studied differences between extraction methods first in high density regions: saliva and oropharynx. DNA extraction method in these regions mostly influenced the relative abundance of bacteria and these findings are in line with the DNA extraction effects previously observed on fecal microbiota structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032942-Salonen1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032942-Wu1">[9]</xref>. The observed differences between methods might be explained by the variation in lyses preferences between methods as gram-positive bacteria in the phyla <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> and <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, are harder to lyse with enzymatic methods because of their ‘tough’ cell walls. DNA extraction utilizing a mechanical approach seemed to be giving higher representation of these hard to lyse and highest overall 16S DNA levels. This is in agreement with literature, where also mechanical lysis with bead beating in combination with phenol was found to perform best in extracting representative DNA from faecal material <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032942-Salonen1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032942-Wu1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032942-Zoetendal1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032942-Zoetendal2">[20]</xref>. In low density samples, Agowa retrieved highest DNA levels and considering both this and the ability to capture all taxa including the hard to lyse taxa, Agowa extraction method seemed to perform best for low density samples.</p>
      <p>In summary, we show a clear boundary of accurate microbiota profiling of density level of &lt;10<sup>6</sup> bacteria per ml and DNA concentration below 1 pg/µl. Below this density level, microbiota profiles seem to become distinct from samples of higher density potentially introducing a serious error in both species representation as well as abundance. Similar samples can vary in retrieved DNA levels by 10–100 fold depending on DNA extraction methodology and can influence microbiota analyses to a greater extent in low density regions.</p>

        <title>Sample collection and storage</title>
        <p>We sampled nasopharynx, nares, oropharynx and saliva of 4 healthy adult volunteers. Exclusion criteria were symptoms of a respiratory infection or prior antibiotic use. Samples were taken at least two hours before or after brushing teeth. Written informed consent was obtained from the participants. This study received approval by the ethics committee of the University Medical Center Utrecht. The study was performed in accordance with the European Statements for Good Clinical Practice, which includes the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p>
        <p>Nasopharynx, nares and oropharynx samples were collected using Copan eswabs and stored in 1 ml liquid Amies Medium (483CE, Copan Diagnostics Inc. , CA). Saliva was collected in the morning before breakfast was consumed by spitting in a 15 ml Falcon tube. Samples were aliquoted per 100 µl in 1.5 ml screw-cap eppendorf tubes (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) and stored at −80°C until further analysis. Tenfold dilutions of saline down to 10<sup>−5</sup> were made from the original undiluted saliva sample of individual 1 and in 1 ml aliquots stored at −70°C.</p>

To increase DNA yields, DNA extracted with all methods was eluted with relatively small volume of 50 µl of recommended elution buffer.</p>
        <p>For the Epicentre Masterpure DNA purification kit (Epicentre) DNA was isolated exactly as per the manufacturers instructions. This method is based on enzymatic/chemical and thermal lysis of cells and DNA precipitation with isopropanol (2-propanol, baker analyzed ACS reagent, catalogue, 9084-03, Avantor performance materials, Phillipsburg NJ).</p>
        <p>Qiagen DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue kit (Qiagen) is also based on enzymatic and chemical lysis with longer incubation at 37 and 56 degrees Celsius. The enzymatic lysis buffer per sample consisted of 0.02 M TrisHCl pH 8, 0. 2 mM Sodium EDTA, 1.2% triton X-100 (catalogue T1503-1kg, catalogue ED2SS-1KG, catalogue 9002-93-1 respectively, Sigma, Saint Louis, MO), 20 mg/µl lysozyme (Kit content) as described in the manufacturers protocol. We added 200 units of mutanolysine (catalogue M9901,Sigma, MS) to this lysis buffer to further facilite bacterial cell lysis. The purification is performed by column binding as per manufacturers instruction.</p>
        <p>Mobio PowerSoil DNA Extraction Kit (Mobio) is a DNA extraction procedure based on mechanical and chemical lysis. DNA was isolated exactly as stated in manufracteres' instruction.</p>
        <p>The last method tested was the phenol/bead beating in combination with Agowa Mag mini DNA extraction kit (Catalogue40401, LGC genomics, Berlin, Germany). Per 0.1 ml sample 0.3 g zirconium beads (diameter 0,1 mm, catalogue 11079101z, Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK), 0,25 ml lysis buffer (Agowa Mag mini DNA extraction kit and 0.2 ml phenol (Phenol solution BioUltra, catalogue P4557, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) was added. The sample was mechanically disrupted by bead beating 2 times for 3 min (Mini-Beadbeater 16, catalogue 607EUR, Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK. The homogenate was placed on ice for at least 1 minute after each beating cycle and centrifuged at 1800 rcf (4000 rpm) for 10 minutes to separate the aqueous and phenolic phases. The aqueous phase was transferred to a new screw-cap Eppendorf tube and binding buffer and magnetic beads, twice the volume of supernatant, were added. To maximize recovery, we incubated samples for 30 minutes instead of 10 min recommended by kit's manufacturer. The remaining steps were executed according to the Agowa Mag Mini DNA extraction protocol.</p>

The UniFrac metric is a proxy for the distance between different microbial communities taking into account the phylogenetic relatedness of lineages in each sample.
