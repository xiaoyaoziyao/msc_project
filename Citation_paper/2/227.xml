<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Atherosclerotic plaque formation is an inflammatory process that involves the recruitment of neutrophil granulocytes and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS formation by myeloperoxidase, a key enzyme in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> degradation, can be modulated by addition of sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN). However, the therapeutic use of NaSCN to counteract atherogenesis has been controversial, because MPO oxidizes NaSCN to hypothiocyanous acid, which is a reactive oxygen species itself. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of NaSCN treatment on atherogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE<sup>−/−</sup>) mice on western-diet were treated with NaSCN for 8 weeks. Blood levels of total cholesterol, IL-10, and IL-6 were measured. Aortic roots from these mice were analyzed histologically to quantify plaque formation, monocyte, and neutrophil granulocyte infiltration. Oxidative damage was evaluated via an L-012 chemiluminescence assay and staining for chlorotyrosine in the aortic walls. Endothelial function was assessed by use of endothelium-dependent vasodilation in isolated aortic rings. Neointima formation was evaluated in wild-type mice following wire injury of the carotid artery.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Results</title>
<p>NaSCN treatment of ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice lead to a reduction of atherosclerotic plaque size in the aortic roots but had no effect on monocyte or granulocyte infiltration. Serum levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 decreased whereas anti-inflammatory IL-10 increased upon NaSCN treatment. In our experiments, we found oxidative damage to be reduced and the endothelial function to be improved in the NaSCN-treated group. Additionally, NaSCN inhibited neointima formation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one cause of global mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref001">1</xref>]. CVD is caused by atherosclerotic plaques, which are formed through a primarily inflammatory remodeling process of the arterial wall. This process leads to chronic vascular stenoses and ischemic end organ damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref002">2</xref>]. Early stages of arterial remodeling include endothelial dysfunction, invasion of immune cells into the vessel wall, as well as formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref003">3</xref>]. In this context, myeloperoxidase (MPO), a heme-enzyme that is produced and secreted by neutrophil granulocytes, promotes ROS formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref004">4</xref>]. MPO is enriched in atherosclerotic plaques and levels of MPO in the plasma can predict cardiovascular mortality following coronary angiography in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref005">5</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>With respect to the molecular mechanism of ROS formation, the heme group of MPO typically serves as an acceptor of electrons during the degradation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2,</sub> and in turn oxidizes Cl<sup>-</sup> and Br<sup>-</sup> ions to HOCl and HOBr via the halogenation cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref007">7</xref>]. The resulting HOCl is a potent oxidant, which oxidizes high-density (HDL) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL), impairs endothelial function and nitric oxide (NO) production, and induces endothelial apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Recently, our group has shown that pharmacological inhibition of MPO by 4-amino benzoic acid hydrazide (4-ABAH) reduces plaque formation in apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>) mice and decreases neointima formation following carotid injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref012">12</xref>]. Besides 4-ABAH, which inhibits MPO and HOCl production irreversibly, thiocyanate (SCN<sup>-</sup>) has a higher affinity to MPO than Cl<sup>-</sup> and competitively inhibits HOCl formation through oxidation of SCN<sup>-</sup> to hypothiocyanous acid (HOSCN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref014">14</xref>]. Interestingly, the product of this reaction, HOSCN, has also been reported to oxidize HDL and LDL and to impair endothelial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref017">17</xref>]. In contrast to HOCl, HOSCN can be degraded specifically via thioredoxin reductase, which gives HOSCN a more favorable oxidative profile than HOCl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>In human studies, high blood levels of SCN<sup>-</sup> after myocardial infarction have been shown to improve long term survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref020">20</xref>]. In contrast, smokers, who are typically at risk for the early development of cardiovascular diseases, also exhibit increased blood levels of SCN<sup>-</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref021">21</xref>]. In order to explore the mechanisms of these conflicting results, we conducted a study, in which we evaluated the effect of SCN<sup>-</sup> on atherogenesis and its underlying pathological mechanisms in a murine model.</p>

<title>Animals and procedures</title>
<p>For the <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, we used apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE<sup>−/−</sup>) and wild-type mice (6–8 weeks old, C57BL/6J background from Charles River, Germany). The animals were kept under standard conditions at 22°C and had free access to water. ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice were fed with a modified western diet consisting of 21% fat, 19.5% casein, and 1.25% cholesterol (SNIFF, Germany). In the intervention group 6 ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> animals were treated with 200 μg NaSCN in 10% DMSO every second day intraperitoneally, whereas control animals only received DMSO or PBS treatment. This procedure typically leads to a rapid, approximately 2-fold, increase in plasma SCN<sup>-</sup> levels of the animals, whereas the plasma through levels remain unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0214476.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were measured with a CODA 6 channel system (Kent Scientific). After 8 weeks of NaSCN / DMSO treatment, the animals were euthanized to collect blood samples and to conduct histological and functional analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0214476.g001">Fig 1</xref>). All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the animal protection law stated in the German civil code. All investigations were approved by the National Office for Nature, Environment and Consumer Protection in Recklinghausen, Nordrhein-Westfalen (Permit Number: 84–02.04.2013.A390).</p>

<title>Schematic illustration of the experimental design.</title>
<p>For the evaluation of plaque development, inflammation, ROS formation, and endothelial function ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice were used after 8 weeks of intraperitoneal application of NaSCN (200 μg every other day) or vehicle (DMSO).

<title>Histological analysis of atherosclerotic lesions</title>
<p>The harvested mouse hearts, including the aortic root, were embedded in Tissue Tek OCT (Miles, U.S.A.) and sliced into 9 μm sections on a Leica cryostat. The aortic sections were placed on poly-L-lysine coated slides and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. Subsequently, we stained the sections with oil red O and hematoxylin following standard protocols. Finally, 15 consecutive sections per animal were analyzed by use of a Zeiss Observer microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany). Digital images were acquired with an AxioCam MRc5 and the Zeiss ZEN imaging software. Atherosclerotic plaque formation was quantified as oil red stained lipid area in percent of the total surface of the vessel wall. Monocyte/macrophage staining was performed by use of an anti-Macrophages/Monocytes antibody, clone MOMA-2 (Merck KGaA, Germany) with an indirect immunoenzymatic staining method. For staining of neutrophil granulocytes, we used a rat anti-neutrophil primary antibody (Abcam, U.K.) and a Cy3-labeled donkey anti-rat-IgG secondary antibody (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories Inc, U.S.A.). For quantification of HOCl damage, immunohistological staining of chlorotyrosine was performed by use of a rabbit anti-chlorotyrosine antibody (Hycult Biotech, HP5002, Netherlands) and a Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit-IgG secondary antibody (Dianova, Germany). As a positive control for the chlorotyrosine staining, aortic sections were pretreated with 0.005% sodium hyopchlorite for 1 hour before staining. A negative control was performed without the primary anti-body.</p>

<title>Biochemical analysis of plasma cytokine, MPO, and cholesterol levels</title>
<p>Plasma levels of IL-10 and IL-6 were assessed via ELISA by use of a commercially available kit (SA Biosciences, Germany). Measurements were performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. First, the samples were transferred into antibody-coated wells. After 120 min of incubation at room temperature, unbound sample was washed away and the detection antibodies were added, followed by 60 min of incubation at 37°C. Subsequently, the samples were incubated with Avidin-HRP and the development reagent for 30 min in the dark. Absorbance was measured using a photometer (Tecan Austria, Austria). MPO plasma levels were measured by use of a Mouse MPO ELISA Kit (Abcam, U.K.). The measurements were performed in duplicate, exactly as advised by the manufacturer, by using 75 μL of EDTA Plasma. Blood cholesterol levels were assessed by use of gas chromatography–flame ionization detection.</p>

<title>Evaluation of endothelial function</title>
<p>In order to assess endothelial function following NaSCN treatment, the descending aortae of ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice were removed and sliced into rings of 3 mm thickness.

<title>Analysis of neointima formation</title>
<p>For the evaluation of neointima formation (n = 10), 6- to 8-week-old wild-type (C57BL/6J, Charles River, Germany) mice were randomized to receive either 200 μg NaSCN in 10% DMSO every second day intraperitoneally or vehicle (10% DMSO) (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0214476.g001">Fig 1</xref>). For the carotid injury model, the mice were anesthetized with 150 mg/kg body weight ketamine hydrochloride (Ketanest, Pharmacia, Sweden) and 0.1 mg/kg body weight xylazine hydrochloride (Rompun 2%, Bayer, Germany). The carotid injury was performed as previously described by Laufs <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref023">23</xref>]. In brief, the external carotid artery was exposed and ligated distally. Subsequently, the common and internal carotid arteries were occluded in order to allow the insertion of a flexible wire into the external carotid artery. The wire was then advanced into the common carotid artery and rotated inside the vessel to cause endothelial damage. Then the proximal occlusions of the common and internal carotid artery were removed to allow normal blood flow in the injured region. Finally, the skin was closed with single sutures. After 14 days, the mice were euthanized and the carotid arteries were removed, fixed, and embedded by use of Tissue Tek OCT (Miles, U.S.A.). The carotid artery was cut into slices of 7 μm and transferred to poly-L-lysine coated slides (Sigma-Aldrich, U.S.A.) for immunohistochemical analysis. Prior to analysis, the cryosections were postfixed in 4% formaldehyde for 2 min and subsequently incubated in 5% normal goat serum for blocking (Sigma-Aldrich, U.S.A.) for 30 min. In order to assess neointima formation, a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-α-smooth-muscle antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, U.S.A.) was used and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma-Aldrich, U.S.A.)) was used to stain the nuclei. Additionally, we performed hematoxylin/eosin staining. The sections were analyzed by use of a Zeiss Oberserver microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany).

Quantification of L-012 chemiluminescence in the aortic segments showed a significant reduction of ROS formation upon treatment with NaSCN 1252.9 ± 356.9 vs 370.1 ± 67.1 RLU/(s*mg), n = 4–6, p = 0.017 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0214476.g003">Fig 3</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we provide evidence that NaSCN treatment reduces atherosclerotic plaque formation in a mouse model of CVD. This effect appears to be independent of monocyte infiltration and blood LDL levels. NaSCN had positive effects on the inflammatory status of the animals, as plasma levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 were reduced upon NaSCN treatment whereas the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 levels were increased. Locally, oxidative stress, an early surrogate marker of endothelial damage, was reduced in the vascular tissue. In line with these results, endothelial function was better preserved in the NaSCN-treated group. Additionally, we show that NaSCN treatment reduces neointima formation following endothelial damage.</p>
<p>The role of thiocyanate treatment to prevent atherosclerosis has been a controversial topic. Our findings are in line with a previous study from Morgan <italic>et al</italic>., who suggest a beneficial effect of oral thiocyanate supplement on atherosclerotic plaque formation in LDL-receptor knock-out mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref024">24</xref>]. NaSCN has a high affinity for MPO and is therefore able to competitively inhibit the formation of HOCl and HOBr at the expense of increased HOSCN formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref014">14</xref>]. HOSCN is also a potent oxidant and mediates various negative cellular effects, such as the disturbance of macrophage glucose metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref025">25</xref>] and of nitric oxide production in endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref015">15</xref>]. But in contrast to HOCl and HOBr, HOSCN can be effectively detoxified by human thioredoxin reductase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref019">19</xref>]. Consequently, NaSCN reduces the oxidative capacity of MPO, leading to reduced oxLDL formation <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<p>In previous studies, a direct inhibition of MPO via 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (4-ABAH) or other small molecules has been found to decrease the development of atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref027">27</xref>]. Compared to previous results from our own group the effects of 4-ABAH and NaSCN are similar in terms of plaque reduction, inflammatory response, endothelial function, and neointima formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>In the present study, we have applied two different methods to quantify oxidative stress and oxidative damage locally in the vessel wall. The L-012 chemiluminescence assay has originally been developed to specifically measure NADPH oxidase-derived superoxide. The transformation of L-012, however, not only depends on superoxide formation, but is also sensitive to peroxidase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref028">28</xref>]. Therefore, we used the L-012 as an unspecific indicator of oxidative stress in the tissue, as suggested by Daiber <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref029">29</xref>]. In order to specifically quantify HOCl mediated oxidative damage, we applied an immunohistological staining method to assess the formation of chlorotyrosine residues in the atherosclerotic plaque area.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we found a trend towards decreased blood pressure in our NaSCN group compared to vehicle treatment. This can be explained by the vasoactive cyanate component, which has be used as an anti-hypertensive drug in the form of potassium thiocyanate and is still used as an emergency anti-hypertensive drug in the form of sodium nitroprusside [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0214476.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>In summary, our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the effect of thiocyanate on the relevant stages of atherosclerosis development. NaSCN treatment was found to affect all stages of plaque formation positively, including inflammatory processes, oxidative damage, endothelial function, and neointima formation. In conclusion, the general profile of NaSCN treatment to reduce atherogenesis seems to be positive in mice.</p>
