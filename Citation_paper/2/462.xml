Three <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Halomonas</italic></named-content> strains were isolated from the Deepwater Horizon site, all of which produced EPS with excellent emulsifying qualities and shared high (97-100%) 16S rRNA sequence identity with strain TG39 and other EPS-producing <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Halomonas</italic></named-content> strains. Analysis of pyrosequence data from surface water samples collected during the spill revealed several distinct <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Halomonas</italic></named-content> phylotypes, of which some shared a high sequence identity (≥97%) to strain TG39 and the Gulf spill isolates.

			<title>Introduction</title>
			<p>Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the ocean is the largest and possibly least understood pool of carbon - ca. 6.9 x 10<sup>17</sup> g C, which is comparable in mass to the carbon in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Much of this DOM exists as biopolymers (ca. 10-25% of total oceanic DOM) that undergo reversible transition between colloidal and dissolved phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A major fraction of marine DOM derives from the synthesis and release of extracellular polymeric substances or exopolysaccharides (EPS) by bacteria and eukaryotic phytoplankton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These are high molecular weight polymers composed mainly of monosaccharides, some of which may contain non-carbohydrate substituents. Several studies have reported large quantities of these bacterial polymers in Antarctic marine environments and around hydrothermal vents, where they are thought to complex with various metal ions and contribute to their mobility and entry into the food web [6 and references therein]. The negative charge associated with carboxyl groups of uronic acids of EPS has been implicated in the capacity of these macromolecules to complex with transition metals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. EPS from marine bacteria, in particular, are recognized for having much higher levels of uronic acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] compared to that found in EPS produced by marine eukaryotic phytoplankton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and non-marine bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. There is a growing body of evidence to implicate uronic acids of EPS in conferring these macromolecules with an ability to interface with hydrophobic organic chemicals, such as hydrocarbons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Amino acids and peptides are also often found associated with marine bacterial EPS, which can confer amphiphilic characteristics to these polymers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The potential significance of marine bacterial EPS to influencing the fate and ultimate degradation of hydrocarbon pollutants in the ocean, particularly during oil spills, remains largely unknown.</p>
			<p>The explosion and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig on April 20, 2010, led to the release of massive quantities of crude oil into the northern Gulf of Mexico, resulting in what has been deemed the worst accidental marine oil spill in the history of the oil and gas industry. The response and complex shifts observed in the microbial communities within and adjacent to waters impacted by the spill have been reported in several publications. Notably, the enrichment of a specific cluster of bacteria within the Order <italic><named-content content-type="order" xlink:type="simple">Oceanospirillales</named-content></italic> – organisms associated with aliphatic hydrocarbon degradation – was found initially (late May 2010) dominating an oil plume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] that had been identified ca. 1000 and 1300 m depth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Dominance of the <italic><named-content content-type="order" xlink:type="simple">Oceanospirillales</named-content></italic> in the plume was succeeded by members affiliated to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Colwellia</italic></named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Cycloclasticus</italic></named-content> by early June 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This succession from aliphatic hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria (<italic><named-content content-type="order" xlink:type="simple">Oceanospirillales</named-content></italic>) to obligate degraders of aromatic hydrocarbons (<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Cycloclasticus</italic></named-content>) and psychrophilic hydrocarbon-degrading generalists (<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Colwellia</italic></named-content>) closely resembles the microbial dynamics observed in seawater following enrichment with crude oil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Several other bacterial groups comprising members with EPS-producing qualities, notably <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Halomonas</italic></named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Alteromonas</italic></named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic></named-content>, were also enriched within the water column [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, one distinctive feature that has received little attention and remains poorly understood was the observed formation of oil aggregates that were abundant on the surface and within deep water oil plumes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Oil aggregates can be broadly defined as floating gelatinous or “fluffy” material, which, by nature of their “stickiness”, can contain embedded droplets of oil. Oil aggregates representing those formed under conditions simulating the Gulf spill were shown to have a glycoprotein composition – i.e. made up largely of carbohydrate and protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Bacteria can contribute large quantities of EPS to the total DOM pool in the ocean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], a large fraction of which can be of glycoprotein composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We therefore hypothesized that EPS-producing bacteria enriched during the spill had contributed to the formation of oil aggregates, as well as to the fate of the oil by influencing the dissolution, bioavailability and ultimate degradation of hydrocarbons by indigenous oil-degrading communities. Whilst oil-aggregate formation at Deepwater Horizon has been shown to be associated with the activities of indigenous microbial communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], the identity of key species involved in potentially triggering this process remains unknown.</p>
			<p>In addition to the enrichment of halomonads in the deep water oil plume at the Gulf spill site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], these organisms have also been shown to become enriched in laboratory enrichments and in the field after exposure to hydrocarbons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Halomonas</italic></named-content> species are slight to moderately halophilic and oligotrophic organisms that are ubiquitous in marine and hypersaline environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], many of which are recognized for producing moderate to large quantities of EPS that can exhibit amphiphilic, or biosurfactant-like, properties. Several reports have shown that these polymers effectively emulsify hydrocarbons, crude oils or refined petroleum products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In the marine environment, where the fate of spilled oil is both poorly understood and of ecological concern, there is a paucity of knowledge regarding the capacity of EPS produced by these and other EPS-producing bacteria to influence the degradation of hydrocarbons. In particular, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are poorly soluble and generally less amenable to biodegradation compared to their aliphatic counterparts. To circumvent limitations in hydrocarbon bioavailability, some microorganisms produce biosurfactants or bioemulsifiers (e.g. amphiphilic EPS) as a mechanism to increase the bioavailability of these compounds for biodegradation.</p>
			<p>In this study, we report on the isolation of three EPS-producing strains of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Halomonas</italic></named-content> from oil-contaminated surface waters during the active phase of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Two of these isolates, designated strains TGOS-10 and GOS-2, shared 100% 16S rRNA sequence identity to two previously described EPS-producing halomonads – respectively <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Halomonas</italic></named-content> sp. strain TG39 and TG67 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The chemical composition and associated functional properties of the EPS produced by strain TG39 has been extensively studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and therefore served as a model to infer the potential influence of <italic>in situ</italic> bacterial-produced EPS on the fate of the oil released by the Deepwater Horizon blowout. We present new data on the capacity of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Halomonas</italic></named-content> EPS to influence the dissolution of aromatic hydrocarbons and enhance the bioavailability of these compounds and rate of biodegradation by the <italic>in situ</italic> sea surface microbial community in the Gulf of Mexico. Using a roller-bottle experimental design, we also provide empirical evidence that implicates indigenous EPS-producing halomonads from Gulf of Mexico waters to having played a role in the formation of oil aggregates during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.</p>

				<p><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Halomonas</italic></named-content> sp. strain TG39 was previously isolated from a laboratory culture of an unclassified marine Chrysophyte (CCAP958/1) based on its growth on <italic>n</italic>-hexadecane as a sole carbon and energy source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The strain was routinely grown on a marine broth (ZM/10) composed of ¾-strength naturally aged seawater, peptone (0.05%), yeast extract (0.01%), and supplemented after autoclaving with filter-sterile (0.2 µm) trace elements and vitamins to final concentrations as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. A synthetic seawater medium, ONR7a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], was used to assess the strain’s ability to grow on or mineralize various hydrocarbons.</p>
				<p>During a research cruise on the RV <italic>Pelican</italic> on May 5 of 2010, oil-contaminated water samples were collected from the sea surface close to the site of the Deepwater Horizon blow-out. In two follow-up cruises on the RV <italic>Walton Smith</italic> (May 31, 2010) and RV <italic>Cape Hatteras</italic> (Oct. 18, 2010), additional water column samples were collected from the same area. Immediately after collection, the samples were stored at 4°C in their collection vessels (i.e. sealed glass containers) for extraction of DNA, isolation of oil-degraders, and degradation and mineralization experiments. Sample names and sampling locations are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>. Sample PE5 was collected 15 days after the blowout from oil-contaminated surface seawater about 0.86 miles from the spill site. Samples B1, B6 and B11 were collected 40 days after the blowout (3.5 mi from the spill site) at 1320 m, 1170 m and 800 m depth which, respectively, represented samples from below, within and above an oil plume that was originally identified between 1000 to 1300 m depth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Sample GIP22 was collected 87 days after capping of the leaky well at 1050 m (37 mi from the spill site) and was used as a reference to represent background levels of the <italic>in situ</italic> microbial community in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

				<p>Isolation of PAH-degrading bacteria from the PE5 surface water sample was performed by streaking 5 µl samples onto ONR7a agar plates that were then individually sprayed with phenanthrene, anthracene, pyrene or fluorene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The plates were stored in closed plastic bags in the dark at room temperature. Colonies forming clearing zones (indicating degradation of the hydrocarbon had occurred) were picked, purified and examined for growth on other PAH compounds as per the method of Kiyohara et al.

					<title>Growth on hydrocarbons</title><p>Because it was identical to one of the isolates from the Gulf spill site (see below) and its cultivation conditions were well-known, strain TG39 was examined for its ability to grow on a variety of hydrocarbon substrates as sole sources of carbon and energy in ONR7a medium. All the compounds used were of reagent quality or better, and were added to final concentrations of between 0.1–0.2% (m/v for solid substrates, v/v for liquid substrates). For organic acids, their sodium salt was used. The compounds tested are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>. For phenol and biphenyl, a small crystal was added to ONR7a medium. D-glucose was included as the positive control. For inoculum preparation, strain TG39 was grown in ZM/10 liquid medium to the late exponential phase. The cells were then washed three times with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), re-suspended using the same buffer (final optical density, 0.3-0.4 at 600 nm) and then inoculated into acid-washed (0.1 N HCl) screw-cap glass tubes (100 x 13 mm) containing 3 ml of ONR7a minimal medium amended with a test carbon source. Growth on benzene, toluene, <italic>p</italic>-xylene, and phenol was also assessed in 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks using a method for delivering the volatile hydrocarbon via the vapour phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Test tube cultures and flasks were incubated with shaking (150 rpm) at 28°C. Growth was monitored spectrophotometrically at 600 nm, or by measuring the change in the total protein content over time using the BCA protein assay kit (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Non-inoculated media, and media inoculated with cells but no added carbon source, were included as controls. All experiments were performed in triplicate.</p>

					<title>Solubilization assays</title><p>The potential of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Halomonas</italic></named-content> EPS to increase the solubility of phenanthrene, fluorene, pyrene and biphenyl was evaluated with the EPS from strain TG39 under conditions of high (natural filtered seawater (FSW) at ca. 0.6 M) and low (diluted FSW to ca. 0.1 M) ionic strength. Both solvents were adjusted to pH 8.0 before use. These experiments were adapted from the method of Barkay et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Stock solutions of the PAHs, at 2000 mg/l in hexane, were prepared and then distributed into acid-washed (0.1 M HCl) glass test tubes (100 x 13 mm) to yield 60 µg of PAH per tube. The hexane was allowed to evaporate before 3-ml volumes of diluent (0.1 M or 0.6 M FSW) containing increasing concentrations of EPS were added to each tube. The concentration range of polymer tested in the 0.1 M FSW treatments was 0.0 to 1.0 mg/ml. Lower concentrations (0.0 to 0.4 mg/ml) were used in the 0.6 M FSW treatments because the addition of more polymer produced turbid solutions. It was therefore apparent that the polymer’s maximal solubility limit in undiluted FSW was equal to or slightly above 0.4 mg/ml. The tubes were capped and gently vortexed prior to incubating at a slight angle overnight in the dark with shaking (150 rpm; 21°C). All experiments were performed in triplicate. The solutions were then filtered (0.2 µm) to remove non-dissolved PAH crystals. Fractions (2 ml each) of the filtrates were taken into clean glass test tubes containing 2 ml hexane and extracted by vortexing for 2 min. A few drops of a saturated solution of NaCl were added to extractions that formed emulsions.

					<title>Effect of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Halomonas</italic></named-content> EPS on the biodegradation of phenanthrene</title><p>Phenanthrene was selected as a model PAH to investigate the influence of the EPS produced by <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><named-content content-type="genus" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Halomonas</italic></named-content> strain TG39</named-content> on the bioavailability and biodegradation of this compound. This was tested using the PE5 water sample collected from the Deepwater Horizon site. For these experiments, sterile 40-ml screw-cap EPA glass vials were prepared, each containing increasing concentrations of EPS -0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 mg/ml – in 5 ml of ONR7a medium. Each vial was inoculated with 200 µl of cell suspension. In order to maintain a consistent mass transfer of phenanthrene in each vial, a two-phase system employing heptamethylnonane (HMN) was used within which phenanthrene (PHE) was dissolved. HMN is generally considered recalcitrant to biodegradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], although some studies have reported its partial breakdown by microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Preliminary experiments in our laboratory with the Gulf water sample yielded no growth on HMN as a sole carbon and energy source. Hence, it was applied in this study as a delivery system for transferring phenanthrene into the aqueous phase. For this, 2 ml of the HMN-PHE solution was carefully dispensed above the aqueous phase in each vial in order to maintain the surface area of the oil–water interface constant and standardized between treatments. All the vials were incubated with gentle rotary shaking (100 rpm) at 21°C for a period of 12 days. Each treatment was performed in triplicate. Sampling was performed by taking 2.5-µl volumes from the HMN-PHE phase in each vial at the time of inoculation and thereafter as indicated. The samples were immediately dissolved in an appropriate volume of ethyl acetate and their absorbance measured spectrophotometrically at 251 nm.

Filtered naturally-aged seawater (FSW) was autoclaved and utilized in these experiments in order to directly associate the formation of any aggregates and/or emulsions to this strain.</p>
					<p>Three roller-bottle experiments were run in duplicate. The first involved the use of inactive/non-respiring cells (Na-azide treated) to examine the potential of the cell surface alone to promote the formation of oil aggregates or the emulsification of the oil (Experiment I). The second employed using cell-free fractions to determine if any extracellularly-released EPS from these strains promoted the same effect (Experiment II). The third experiment used live cells to evaluate whether cell activity, such as degradation of the oil by the strain, might promote aggregate and/or emulsion formation (Experiment III). The inoculum for each of these experiments was prepared by growing up a large batch of cells in FSW amended with filter-sterilized Gulf of Mexico BP crude oil (0.2 µm; 2% v/v), glucose (to 0.05% w/v final concentration), and a trace elements and vitamin mixture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The cell biomass was recovered by centrifugation (8,000 x g; 20 min) and the supernatant fraction set aside. The cells were washed twice with autoclaved FSW, re-suspended to a final optical density (600 nm) of 0.06, and supplemented with Na-azide (0.01% w/v final concentration) to render the cells inactive for use in Experiment I. Preparation of the cell-free fraction for Experiment II involved removal of all residual cells from the supernatant fraction (collected as described above) by filtration (0.2 µm) and supplementing the filtrate with Na-azide as above. Washed ‘live’ cells (i.e. in the absence of Na-azide treatment) were used (0.06 final OD<sub>600</sub>) for Experiment III. Each of the three experiments was conducted in duplicate using 250-ml Pyrex© glass bottles (38 x 265 mm) which were filled with 200 ml of the respective inoculum fraction, and to each 1 ml of sterile BP crude oil was added to a final oil slick content of 0.5% (v/v). Control incubations were run in parallel using uninoculated autoclaved FSW in the presence or absence of oil. Inoculated controls were also included, but without the addition of oil. The bottles were incubated at 25°C in the dark on a roller table at 3.5 rpm for 12 days. The bottles were periodically placed upright to photographically record the formation of oil aggregates and emulsification of the oil. Samples were also withdrawn for light microscopy or staining with acridine orange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] for imaging with a FITC filter on a Zeiss Axioscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany).</p>
					<p>At the end of these 12-day roller bottle incubations, visible aggregates were carefully withdrawn using glass Pasteur pipettes and transferred to 1.5-ml microtubes for staining with the cationic copper phthalocyanine dye alcian blue (AB) at pH 2.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] or the amino acid-specific dye coomassie brilliant blue G (CBBG) at pH 7.4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].

Degradation followed first order kinetics in all four treatments with an initial lag of approximately 2 days, followed thereafter by rapid rates of degradation that were higher for the EPS-amended treatments compared to the untreated control. During the time interval between day 2 to day 5, the degradation rates for the three EPS-amended treatments were statistically similar (281–310 mg/l/day; <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05), though significantly higher (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) compared to that of the untreated control (211 mg/l/day) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0067717.s001">Supplementary table S1</xref>).

Complete removal of the phenanthrene in the EPS-amended treatments occurred sooner (i.e. by day 8) than in the untreated control (i.e. 11-12 days).

			<p>Various marine <named-content content-type="order" xlink:type="simple">gammaproteobacteria</named-content> have been found to secrete biosurfactant molecules that can enhance the solubilization of hydrocarbons. This is particularly advantageous to hydrocarbon-degrading organisms because the extremely low solubility of many hydrocarbon compounds is an important factor limiting their degradation in the marine environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. Here we investigated the ability of the EPS produced by <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Halomonas</italic></named-content> sp. strain TG39 to promote the dissolution and biodegradation of hydrocarbons, with particular reference to the role that EPS-producing bacteria contributed to the fate of the oil released from the blowout of the Macondo well at Deepwater Horizon. Our initial experiments focused on evaluating the versatility of strain TG39 for degrading various hydrocarbon substrates and comparing this to the hydrocarbon-degrading profiles of other <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Halomonas</italic></named-content> species which have been shown to degrade mono-aromatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>], polycyclic aromatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>] and aliphatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] hydrocarbons. Notably, strain TG39 mineralized phthalate, <italic>p</italic>-cresol and o-cresol, which, to our knowledge, are compounds that have not previously been shown to be utilized by other species of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Halomonas</italic></named-content>. For example, Garcia et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>] isolated ca. 40 distinct strains of aromatic-degrading halomonads from aquatic saltern environments and hypersaline soils in the south of Spain, none of which were found capable of degrading <italic>p</italic>-cresol.</p>
			<p>Some species of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Halomonas</italic></named-content> have been found to express EPS on their cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>], which in some cases has been shown to enable the cells to make direct contact with oil droplets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], possibly as a mechanism to access the substrate as a food source. For example, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Halomonas</italic></named-content> sp. ANT-3b produces an emulsifying glycolipid that allows the cells to colonize and disrupt the oil–water interface of <italic>n</italic>-hexadecane droplets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Microscopic examination of strain TG39 cells growing on <italic>n</italic>-hexadecane showed no evidence of their attachment to oil droplets, even after cell suspensions had been subjected to vigorous shaking under our emulsification assay (results not shown). This suggests that the cell surface of strain TG39 lacks the amphiphilic quality that is characteristic of its produced EPS. This corroborates earlier observations that showed washed whole-cell suspensions of strain TG39 to completely lack the capacity to emulsify oils, and that emulsifying activities were solely associated with cell-free extracts which contained EPS produced by the strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Halomonas</italic></named-content> strains GOS-2, GOS-3a and TGOS-10 isolated from Deepwater Horizon exhibited similar characteristics, including the capacity to produce EPS that effected the emulsification of oil.</p>
			<p>Previous work with the EPS of strain TG39 showed that it effectively emulsified <italic>n</italic>-hexadecane and several food-grade oils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In preliminary experiments, emulsification assays performed with several other hydrocarbons, such as cycloparaffins, and mono- and alkyl-aromatics, showed this EPS to exhibit exceptional versatility in its capacity to emulsify a wide spectrum of hydrocarbon substrates (results not shown). Chemical characterization of strain TG39’s EPS revealed that its ability to associate with and emulsify hydrocarbons may be conferred by its high uronic acids (30.8%) and rhamnose content (31.7%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] – moieties that can render EPS quite lipophilic and mediate the adsorption of polysaccharides to oil droplets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>]. Additionally, the proteinaceous component of this EPS could also mediate its adsorption to oil droplets by nature of its hydrophobicity, penetrating into the oil where they become solvated and act as anchoring points. The observed emulsification activity prompted us to evaluate whether this polymer might enhance the solubilisation of hydrocarbons and, if so, whether this could also influence their availability for microbial degradation. The model aromatic pollutants phenanthrene, pyrene, fluorene and biphenyl were selected since these compounds have extremely low aqueous solubilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>], making them ideal substrates for this investigation. The aromatic hydrocarbons tested covered a range of partition coefficient (log<italic>P</italic>) values -4.0 for biphenyl; 4.2 for fluorene; 4.5 for phenanthrene; 5.2 for pyrene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>]. Irrespective of ionic-strength, the effect of EPS on the aqueous solubility of the hydrocarbons correlated inversely with the inherent log<italic>P</italic> of these compounds. In other words, hydrocarbons with lower log<italic>P</italic> values were more effectively solubilised by the EPS, possibly due to physico-chemical interactions between the hydrocarbons and hydrophobic regions of the amphiphilic polymers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>]. The EPS-mediated enhancement in the solubilisation of hydrocarbons with lower log<italic>P</italic> values may be related to the polarity of these compounds, potentially allowing them to associate, to some degree, with negatively-charged residues (e.g. uronic acids) associated with the EPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]. It is noteworthy that lower soluble concentrations were measured for each hydrocarbon in the 0.6 M FSW treatment (ca. 35% salinity) compared to that in the 0.1 M treatment (ca. 0.8% salinity) at each EPS concentration used, possibly because an inverse relationship exists between salinity and hydrocarbon solubility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>]. As hydrocarbons are less soluble in seawater, the production of amphiphilic EPS by hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria in marine environments would be considered advantageous to increasing the solubility of these substrates, and thus also their bioavailability for degradation.</p>
			<p>Interestingly, the effect of increasing concentrations of the EPS on the dissolution of biphenyl in the 0.1 M (low ionic strength) treatment did not follow the linear trend observed with the other hydrocarbons. This EPS has been shown to have a polydispersity index of 1.8, which is relatively high and denotes considerable heterogeneity in the molecular-size range of polysaccharide molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It has also been shown that under conditions of low ionic strength, this heterogeneity is substantially reduced as polysaccharide molecules of different sizes come together to form larger molecular-weight species, or aggregates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This would be expected to significantly reduce the multivalency and exposure of hydrophobic regions of the EPS that would otherwise be available to interface with hydrocarbons. The formation of these aggregates apparently occurred at EPS concentrations above 0.25 mg/ml, which would have reduced the number of biphenyl-binding sites on the EPS macromolecular structure and thereby explain the incapacity of the EPS to solubilize higher concentrations of the biphenyl. Since the rate of dissolution of a compound is a critical measure of its bioavailability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>], it can have a significant influence on the degradation rate of the compound. This is particularly important with hydrocarbons that exhibit extremely low aqueous solubilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>]. Since we did not observe the attachment of strain TG39 cells to hydrocarbon droplets (results not shown), this assumes that its growth on hydrocarbons would occur at the expense of dissolved substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">89</xref>]. Whereas the strain was unable to utilize biphenyl, fluorene and phenanthrene as sole sources of carbon and energy, its produced EPS however was found to effectively increase the solubility of these hydrocarbons. In these instances, organisms such as strain TG39 may be expected to provide an advantage to other marine bacteria that would otherwise be limited in their capacity to gain access to these compounds, as was demonstrated in our phenanthrene experiments with a natural community of indigenous microbiota from the Deepwater Horizon site. These results provide the first line of evidence that implicate <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Halomonas</italic></named-content> EPS in enhancing the degradation of oil hydrocarbons in the marine environment by increasing the dissolution and bioavailability of these compounds to indigenous oil-degrading microorganisms, such as during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.</p>
			<p>Though the relative abundance of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Halomonas</italic></named-content> in oil-contaminated surface waters at Deepwater Horizon was quite low, they were by no means inactive since several <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Halomonas</italic></named-content> phylotypes were enriched (by 1550% collectively) as a result of the spill compared to the reference sample (GIP22) where all but one of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Halomonas</italic></named-content> phylotypes were undetected. Hazen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], for instance, also reported the enrichment of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Halomonas</italic></named-content> by 140% in the deepwater oil plume compared to the abundance of this group in uncontaminated reference waters. The absence of 16S rRNA fragment reads in the other water column samples collected during the spill (B1, B6, B11) may be explained by the lower sequencing depth (total number of reads) in these pyrosequence libraries compared to that of the surface water PE5 library. In addition to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Halomonas</italic></named-content>, other types of EPS-producing bacteria were markedly enriched in surface waters during the spill, which by nature of their potential to produce and release EPS, may similarly have contributed to the fate of the oil. Notably, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Colwellia</italic></named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Alteromonas</italic></named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic></named-content> were enriched by at least one order of magnitude compared to their abundance in uncontaminated reference waters. These organisms collectively represented ca. 3% of total bacterial sequences in the PE5 library. Since strains of these genera have been well characterized for their ability to produce EPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">90</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">95</xref>], their enrichment in surface waters during the spill may have also stimulated their production and release of significant quantities of EPS. Considering the potential of marine bacterial EPS to interface with oil hydrocarbons and enhance the bioavailability of these compounds for microbial degradation, we posit that these types of bacteria contributed significantly to the fate of the oil released into the Gulf of Mexico via their production and release of EPS.</p>
			<p>Supporting this hypothesis, insights on the formation of oil aggregates during the Gulf spill also point to a role for bacterial EPS in the fate of the oil. Oil-in-water emulsions at the sea surface-air interface were observed during the Gulf spill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and were very likely a precursor to the formation of oil aggregates that were found prolific in surface and, to a lesser extent, in plume waters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Considering that oil aggregates were observed before BP had begun dumping tonnes of dispersant into the Gulf of Mexico [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], and laboratory roller-bottle experiments showed their rapid formation in the absence of any added dispersant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], the formation of these aggregates was very likely a biologically-driven process, possibly initiated via the physicochemical interaction between oil droplets, microorganisms and biopolymer(s), likely of bacterial origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Ziervogel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] showed that oil aggregates yielded high levels of peptidase and β-glucosidase activities, indicating that a major component of their composition is glycoprotein. This is consistent with the composition of marine bacterial EPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">96</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">97</xref>], including that from many <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Halomonas</italic></named-content> species such as strains TG39 and TG67 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] – strains with 100% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity to, respectively, the strains TGOS-10 and GOS-2 which we isolated from the Gulf spill site. During incubations with uncontaminated deep water samples collected during the active phase of the Gulf oil spill, Baelum et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">98</xref>] reported on the formation of flocs (synonymous with oil aggregates). Analysis of these flocs revealed that they were composed of oil, carbohydrates and biomass, predominantly of bacteria most closely related to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Colwellia</italic></named-content>. Members of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Colwellia</italic></named-content> have been shown to produce EPS under conditions reminiscent of those found in cold deep Gulf of Mexico waters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">93</xref>], suggesting that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Colwellia</italic></named-content> may have contributed to the fate of the oil, including formation of oil aggregates, through their production of EPS during the Gulf of Mexico spill. Since these experiments were conducted using mixed microbial communities, it is difficult however to ascertain the formation of these flocs to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Colwellia</italic></named-content> species. No methods currently exist that can accurately trace the production of polymeric substances to their biological source in environmental samples, which therefore circumvents our ability to explain what type(s) of polymeric substances participated in the formation of flocs or oil aggregates, and to consequently link them to a producing organism(s).</p>
			<p>Using a roller bottle incubation design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], we demonstrated the independent ability of <italic>Halomonas</italic> strain TGOS-10 to promote the formation of oil aggregates and emulsification of the BP crude oil. We showed that the extracellular cell surface of this organism played a direct role in aggregate formation, as demonstrated in roller bottle incubations using non-respiring cells that had been rendered inactive by treatment with sodium-azide. Baelum et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">98</xref>] proposed that aggregate formation was initiated on the surface of oil droplets. However, direct microscopic observation of nascent aggregates that formed in the first 3 days of our roller bottle incubations contradicts this because some of these aggregates lacked associated oil droplets. Oil droplets, therefore, likely did not act as a nucleation point for aggregate formation. A distinctive feature of the aggregates was their heavy loading with attached TGOS-10 cells, indicating that bacterial cell-surface-expressed EPS potentially contributed a key role in aggregate formation. Hence, the combination of bacterial cells (i.e. strain TGOS-10), dissolved hydrocarbons and EPS were likely involved in having promoted the formation of mucilaginous aggregates that progressively adopted associated oil droplets – the latter conferring the aggregates with increased buoyancy and eventual ability to float. Positive staining of the aggregates with AB and CBBG provided evidence of their glycoprotein composition, which is a major component of marine bacterial EPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">96</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">97</xref>].</p>
			<p>The ephemeral formation of inconspicuous aggregates in the first 24 hours of the roller bottle incubations with respiring cells was thereafter overshadowed by the emulsification of the oil slick, progressively becoming a reddish-brown that is reminiscent of weathered oil after an oil spill at sea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">99</xref>]. Preliminary experiments with strain TGOS-10 showed it capable of degrading <italic>n</italic>-alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons (results not shown), suggesting that the extensive emulsification of the oil in these roller bottle incubations could be attributed to the breakdown of biodegradable components in the oil, such as low molecular weight aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. The more recalcitrant components of oil (i.e. asphaltenes and resins) are often the remnants of weathered oil. By nature of their polarity, they can form stable water-in-oil emulsions similar to that observed in these roller bottle incubations. Since the formation of aggregates preceded the emulsification of oil in the roller bottle incubations that contained inactivated (Experiment I) or active (Experiment III) cells, and aggregates did not form in control incubations without bacterial cells added, this indicates that cell-bound EPS of strain TGOS-10 contributed to promoting aggregate formation.</p>
			<p>In conclusion, we showed that the EPS produced by <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Halomonas</italic></named-content> sp. strain TG39 can effectively mediate the dissolution of poorly-soluble aromatic hydrocarbons and enhance their bioavailability to indigenous populations of microorganism that were present during the active phase of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. As this model strain shared 100% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity to TGOS-10 and their produced EPS exhibited similar physicochemical properties, these and other EPS-producing halomonads enriched during the spill likely contributed to the degradation of the oil and in oil-aggregate formation. Moreover, species of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Colwellia</italic></named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Alteromonas</italic></named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple"><italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic></named-content>, which were also found enriched in surface and deep waters during the spill, may also have contributed to the formation of oil aggregates by nature of their potential to produce EPS. There is substantial evidence to suggest that oil-aggregate formation during the Gulf spill was mediated by bacterial EPS, either produced in response to the oil released, or that was present as part of the pre-spill DOM pool in the water column. Importantly, our results provide evidence that this bacterial-derived EPS contributed to the dissolution, bioavailability and microbial degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons, particularly in surface waters where EPS-producing bacteria were preferentially enriched. While whole bacterial and eukaryotic phytoplankton cells may also play a role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], these results add to a growing body of evidence to implicate bacterial-derived EPS in the fate of the oil released at the Deepwater Horizon site.</p>
