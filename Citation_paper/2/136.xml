<abstract>
<p>Microbial activity in produced water from hydraulic fracturing operations can lead to undesired environmental impacts and increase gas production costs. However, the metabolic profile of these microbial communities is not well understood. Here, for the first time, we present results from a shotgun metagenome of microbial communities in both hydraulic fracturing source water and wastewater produced by hydraulic fracturing. Taxonomic analyses showed an increase in anaerobic/facultative anaerobic classes related to <italic>Clostridia</italic>, <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic>, <italic>Bacteroidia</italic> and <italic>Epsilonproteobacteria</italic> in produced water as compared to predominantly aerobic <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic> in the fracturing source water. The metabolic profile revealed a relative increase in genes responsible for carbohydrate metabolism, respiration, sporulation and dormancy, iron acquisition and metabolism, stress response and sulfur metabolism in the produced water samples. These results suggest that microbial communities in produced water have an increased genetic ability to handle stress, which has significant implications for produced water management, such as disinfection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>High-volume hydraulic fracturing operations for natural gas development from deep shale produce millions of gallons of wastewater over the lifetime of the well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Veil1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Arthur1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Gregory1">[3]</xref>, commonly termed as ‘produced water’. This produced water contains elevated concentrations of salts, metals, hydrocarbons and radioactive elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Gregory1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Barbot1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-MuraliMohan1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Soeder1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Hill1">[7]</xref>. Microbial communities in produced water can utilize hydrocarbons as sources of carbon and energy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Moore1">[8]</xref> and transform redox labile salts and metals. This can give rise to significant water management challenges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-MuraliMohan2">[9]</xref> and increased production costs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Kermani1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Little1">[11]</xref>. For instance, sulfidogenic and acid producing bacteria can cause corrosion of metal infrastructure, souring of natural gas, and reduced formation permeability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Kermani1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Little1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Fichter1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Roberge1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>Deleterious microbial activity is commonly controlled with biocides at significant cost to the driller. However, despite biocide use, microbial activity is prevalent in produced water. Previous studies have shown that biocide effectiveness may be limited by high salt concentrations, organic compounds, and long residence times in the subsurface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Struchtemeyer1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Struchtemeyer2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Williams1">[16]</xref>. Other studies have shown that microbial communities in produced water are distinct from those in the injected fracturing fluid, and correlate well with changes in geochemical and environmental conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-MuraliMohan1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Struchtemeyer2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Davis1">[17]</xref>. This implies that the common practice of recycling produced water for subsequent hydraulic fracturing may introduce adapted populations into the formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-MuraliMohan1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>Over the past decade molecular ecology surveys based on the 16S rRNA gene have increased our knowledge about the taxonomic composition of microbial communities in reservoir environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-MuraliMohan1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Struchtemeyer2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Davis1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Dahle1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Pham1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Grabowski1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-vanderKraan1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Gittel1">[22]</xref>. However, these studies offer limited insights on the metabolic capabilities of the microbial community, as they rely on taxonomic inference based on 16S rRNA gene similarity to previously isolated microorganisms. As an example of the limitations of using previously isolated microorganisms to infer metabolic capability, the ‘core genome’ of the well-studied <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is typically less than 50% of the genes in the genome, and &lt;30% of the <italic>E. coli</italic> pan-genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Hendrickson1">[23]</xref>. On the other hand, shotgun metagenomic surveys enable access to complete genetic information within microbial genomes from uncultured, mixed consortia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Dinsdale1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-DeLong1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Tringe1">[26]</xref>. These surveys have provided significant insights on the functional potential of microorganisms in diverse environments such as marine samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-DeLong1">[25]</xref>, corals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Wegley1">[27]</xref>, activated sludge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Yu1">[28]</xref>, permafrost <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Yergeau1">[29]</xref>, hydrocarbon and sandstone reservoirs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Dongshan1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Dong1">[31]</xref>, and swine gut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Lamendella1">[32]</xref>. Despite the importance of microbial activity in produced water brines from hydraulic fracturing operations, the functional potential of associated microbial communities has not yet been studied. In this study, the metagenome of fracturing source water and produced water at two different time points from a Marcellus Shale natural gas well in Westmoreland County, PA was generated using Illumina MiSeq technology. The microbial ecology from 16S rRNA surveys and chemical composition of these samples has been described in a previous publication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-MuraliMohan1">[5]</xref>. Sequences from each sample were assembled into contiguous sequences (contigs) and analyzed for taxonomic affiliations and functional potential of the microbial communities.</p>

<title>Sampling</title>
<p>Samples of hydraulic fracturing source water, and produced water on days 1 and 9 were collected from a horizontally drilled Marcellus Shale natural gas well in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, U.S.A in October 2011. The source water used for fracturing was a mix of fresh reservoir water (∼80%) and produced water (∼20%) from previous fracturing operations. Fracturing additives amended to the source water included proppant (silica sand), scale inhibitor (ammonium chloride), biocide (mixture of tributyl tetradecyl phosphonium chloride, methanol and proprietary chemicals), hydrochloric acid, gel (paraffinic solvent), breaker (sodium persulfate) and friction reducer (hydrotreated petroleum distillate). Details regarding the sampling procedure and chemical additives used in the fracturing process are described elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-MuraliMohan1">[5]</xref>. The aqueous geochemical characteristics of these samples were described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-MuraliMohan1">[5]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107682.s003">Table S1</xref>).</p>

<p>Unfiltered water samples were centrifuged at 6,000 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min in an Avanti J-E centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) to pellet cells. DNA was extracted from 0.25 g of cell pellet using MO BIO power soil DNA isolation kit (MO BIO, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA was prepared using Nextera XT DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to manifacturer's instructions at Genewiz (South Plainfield, NJ). DNA for sequencing was quantified using qPCR prior to clustering, and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with a 2×250 PE configuration at Genewiz, NJ. Sequencing demultiplexing was performed on the Illumina MiSeq instrument using sample-specific barcodes.</p>

<p>The raw unpaired sequences were checked for sequencing tags and adapters using the predict function implemented within the TagCleaner program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Schmieder1">[33]</xref>. No sequencing tags or adapters were identified. Sequences were then subjected to quality control using the FastX toolkit within the Galaxy platform <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Goecks1">[34]</xref> with a minimum length 100 and minimum quality score 20. The velvet assembler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Zerbino1">[35]</xref> was used to assemble sequences that passed quality control into contiguous sequences. The assembly parameters were empirically optimized for the dataset prior to assembly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107682.s004">Table S2</xref>); the dataset was processed using a kmer length of 77.

<p>As an additional assembly-independent analysis, sequence data was mapped against reference genomes downloaded from NCBI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107682.s005">Table S3</xref>) with CLC Genomics Workbench (Version 6.5.1, CLC Bio, Aarhus, Denmark) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-CLC1">[41]</xref> using default parameters and no masking.

<p>An increase in the number of contigs associated with the class <italic>Clostridia</italic> was observed in the produced water day 1 sample (17%) as compared to the fracturing source water (1%). However, the relative abundance of <italic>Clostridia</italic> decreased to 3% in the produced water day 9 sample. The majority of the <italic>Clostridia</italic> in the produced water day 1 sample were affiliated to the order <italic>Thermoanaerobacterales</italic> (94% of <italic>Clostridia</italic>; 16% of the total community) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g002">Figure 2</xref>). <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic> sequences constituted a minor fraction (6%) of the total community in the fracturing source water and produced water day 1 samples but increased in relative abundance to constitute the dominant class (52%) in the produced water day 9 sample.

The day 9 samples also showed an increase in relative abundance of <italic>Epsilonproteobacteria</italic> (16%) and <italic>Bacteroidia</italic> (10%) classes as compared to the other samples (&lt;2% of the total community). The major bacterial phyla, classes and orders identified in this study were consistent with previous 16S rRNA gene based clone library and pyrosequencing surveys of these samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107682.s002">Figure S2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-MuraliMohan1">[5]</xref>.

<title>Mapping results</title>
<p>Metagenomic reads were mapped against a diverse set of reference genomes to confirm MG-RAST taxonomic results and only reference genomes with good mapping results are discussed in this section. Reference genome mapping results confirmed taxonomic MG-RAST contig analysis. The best mapping results for source water were obtained when sequences were mapped against reference genomes of <italic>Alphaproteabacteria</italic>, specifically of the order <italic>Rhodobacterales</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g003">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g004">4</xref>). Similarly, produced water day 1 sample mapping results suggest that it was dominated by bacteria of the orders <italic>Rhodobacterales</italic> and <italic>Thermoanaerobacterales</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g003">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g004">4</xref>). A distinct shift in bacterial community was observed between produced water day 1 samples and produced water day 9 samples based on mapping results. Best mapping results for produced water day 9 samples were obtained for reference genomes in the order <italic>Campylobacterales</italic> and <italic>Alteromondales</italic> further supporting the MG-RAST results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g003">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g004">4</xref>). Produced water samples demonstrated a distinctive signature with reads mapping best to few select reference genomes, while source water sample reads were distributed more evenly throughout all included reference genomes. For four reference genomes (<italic>Thermoanaerobacter sp.</italic> X514, <italic>Thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus</italic>, <italic>Thermoanaerobacter mathranii</italic> in produced water day 1 samples and <italic>Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus</italic> DSM 7299 <italic>i</italic>n produced water day 9 sample) more than 80% coverage was achieved suggesting that these species could play important roles in the microbial community of the representative sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Highest observed reference genome coverage for source water sample sequences were 79% for <italic>Roseovarius</italic> sp. 217, 40% for <italic>Ruegeria pomeroyi</italic> and 38% for <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g003">Figure 3</xref>). For produced water day 1 samples, about 10% of all trimmed sequencing reads mapped against the three <italic>Thermanaerobacter</italic> genomes included in the analysis and 8–13% of reads mapped successfully against <italic>Roseovarius sp.</italic> 217 and <italic>Roseovarius nubinhibens</italic> genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g004">Figure 4</xref>). 7.7% of produced water day 1 reads mapped against the <italic>Ruegeria pomeroyi</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g004">Figure 4</xref>). 4–6% of reads for produced water day 9 samples mapped against two different <italic>Marinobacter</italic> and <italic>Arcobacter</italic> reference genomes and one <italic>Vibrio</italic> reference genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Almost 16% of all reads from source water samples mapped against <italic>Roseovarius sp.</italic> 217 and approximately 4–6% of reads for source water sample mapped against each <italic>Dinoroseobacter shibae</italic>, <italic>Ruegeria pomeroyi</italic>, <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic> and <italic>Rhodobacter capsulatus</italic> genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

<title>Sulfur metabolism gene mapping results</title>
<p>Very few reads in all three samples were successfully mapped against the sulfur metabolism genes dsrA and dsrB. 7 reads of produced water day 1 sample and 55 reads of produced water day 9 sample were successfully mapped against the dsrA/dsrB gene of <italic>Desulfovibrio desulfuricans</italic> with a coverage of 28% and 78% respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107682.s006">Table S4a</xref>).

For aspA genes, the produced water day 9 sample showed best results with 16, 11, 9 and 6 reads successfully mapped against aspA genes of <italic>Desulfovirbio alaskensis</italic>, <italic>Desulfococcus mulitvorans</italic>, <italic>Desulfotignum balcticum</italic> and <italic>Desulfobacterium autotorphicum</italic> with a coverage of 94%, 46%, 33% and 31% respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107682.s006">Table S4b</xref>). Very few source water and produced water day 1 reads were mapped successfully against the aspA genes included in the analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107682.s006">Table S4b</xref>). These results suggest that sulfur metabolism could play a more important role in produced water day 9 sample due the higher abundance of genes associated with sulfur metabolism. Organisms that can metabolize sulfur compounds to sulfide are of interest in oil and gas environments because of their potential role in infrastructure corrosion, gas souring, worker safety as well as environmental health concerns.</p>

<title>Functional classification of metagenomes</title>
<p>The SEED subsystems database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Overbeek1">[42]</xref>, was used to predict the metabolic potential of fracturing source water and produced water samples.

The abundance of contigs designated to Level 1 functional categories is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g005">Figure 5</xref>.

<p>Functional annotations were assigned based on the Subsystems database. The affiliations of Level 2 categories to Level 1 categories are coded as follows CS- Clustering based subsystems; C- Carbohydrates; PM- Protein metabolism; DNA- DNA metabolism; R- Respiration; SR- Stress response; SM- Sulfur metabolism; DS- Dormancy and sporulation; IAM- Iron acquisition and metabolism.</p>

<p>The five most abundant Level 1 functional categories in all three samples were found to be clustering-based subsystems (e.g. genes where functional coupling is evident but function is unknown;∼14%), carbohydrate metabolism (7–9%), amino acids and derivatives (7–8%), miscellaneous (eg: genes associated with iron sulfur cluster assembly and Niacine-Choline transport and metabolism; 8–9%), protein metabolism (6–8%), suggesting the dominant role of these functional categories in all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g005">Figure 5</xref>). These functional categories were similarly identified as dominant in previous studies of soil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Delmont1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Urich1">[45]</xref>, marine samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Dinsdale1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Gilbert1">[46]</xref>, activated sludge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Dinsdale1">[24]</xref>, freshwater <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Dinsdale1">[24]</xref> and hypersaline environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Dinsdale1">[24]</xref>. Normalization of gene abundance data shows a relative increase in each of the above functional categories in the produced water samples as compared to the fracturing source water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g006">Figure 6</xref>) implying that core systems necessary for survival are enriched in the produced water community.</p>
<p>While comparison of gene abundance affiliated with the dominant broad Level 1 categories suggests similar functional profiles across samples, analysis of more specific Level 2 functional categories shows sample specific differences in metabolic capabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Differences in metabolic potential indicate a selective pressure exerted in the subsurface for microbes with particular metabolic capabilities. For instance, within the Level 1 carbohydrate metabolism category, sequences related to Level 2 functional categories such as mono-, di-, oligo- and polysaccharides, and aminosugar metabolism were present in higher relative abundance in the produced water samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This finding correlates well with the expected higher content of carbohydrates in produced water samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-MuraliMohan1">[5]</xref>. Carbohydrates and polysaccharide compounds added during hydraulic fracturing can serve as carbon and energy sources for microbial activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Moore1">[8]</xref>. Within the Level 1 protein metabolism category, sequences affiliated with the Level 2 selenoprotein category were detected only in the produced water samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g007">Figure 7</xref>). One possible explanation is the role of selenoproteins in combating oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Lu1">[47]</xref>, which may arise from elevated concentrations of organic or inorganic dissolved constituents in produced water <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Valavanidis1">[48]</xref>. Results showed that <italic>Rhodobacterales</italic> were the dominant population involved in oxidative stress response in source water and produced water day 1 samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g008">Figure 8</xref>). However, <italic>Alteromonadales</italic> and <italic>Vibrionales</italic> were the dominant orders involved in oxidative stress response in produced water day 9 sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Within the Level 1 clustering subsystem, genes affiliated with the Level 2 carbohydrate metabolism show a relative increase in the produced water samples as compared to fracturing source water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g007">Figure 7</xref>). An increase in the relative abundance of genes related to carbohydrate metabolism in produced water compared to fracturing source water suggests the potential for utilization of hydrocarbons added either as fracturing fluid amendments or those derived from the shale formation and an overall shift to a more heterotrophic microbial community.</p>

<p>Less abundant Level 1 functional categories showing an increase in normalized abundance in produced water samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g006">Figure 6</xref>) included genes affiliated with stress response (3%), respiration (3–4%), iron acquisition and metabolism (1%), sulfur metabolism (1%), and dormancy and sporulation (0.2–1%). Analysis of Level 2 functional categories within these Level 1 domains identified differences in metabolic potential between these samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Within the Level 1 stress response domain, produced water samples showed a greater relative abundance of sequences affiliated with Level 2 categories such as acid stress, heat shock, periplasmic stress and osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The increase in the relative abundance of these genes suggests a response to external stress experienced by the produced water microbial community. Results suggest that produced water day 1 population involved in osmotic stress response was dominated by the order <italic>Rhodobacterales</italic> and produced water day 9 population involved osmotic stress response was dominated by the orders <italic>Vibrionales</italic> and <italic>Alteromonadales</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Subsurface stresses can include increased subsurface temperatures (&gt;40°C) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Driscoll1">[49]</xref>, addition of HCl and biocides to fracturing fluid, and higher concentrations of dissolved salts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107682.s003">Table S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-MuraliMohan1">[5]</xref>. Within the Level 1 respiration category, sequences affiliated to the Level 2 category of sodium ion coupled energetics were undetected in fracturing source water (Na<sup>+</sup> 2.9 g/L) but increased in relative abundance with time in produced water samples (Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations in PW day 1 and day 9 were 13.9 and 43 g/L) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This suggests that the produced water microbial community could use sodium ion coupled energetics for their energy needs, consistent with previous observations in saline environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Kogure1">[50]</xref>. In the Level 1 domain of sulfur metabolism, the relative abundance of genes affiliated with Level 2 functional categories of inorganic and organic sulfur assimilation increased in produced water samples as compared to fracturing source water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Genes recovered from produced water day 1 show that populations involved in sulfur metabolism were dominated by the orders <italic>Rhodobacterales</italic> and <italic>Thermoanaerobacterales</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g010">Figure 10</xref>).

Within the Level 1 domain of iron metabolism, sequences affiliated with siderophores, undetected in the fracturing source water, increased with time in produced water samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Siderophores are strong chelators of ferric iron secreted and are utilized by bacteria for iron metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Sandy1">[51]</xref>.

Within the Level 1 dormancy and sporulation category, high relative abundance of Level 2 spore DNA protection related sequences in produced water day 1 sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107682-g007">Figure 7</xref>) suggests the potential for long term dormancy of cells through DNA protection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107682-Setlow1">[52]</xref>.

The metabolic profile showed both a relative increase and functional changes in genes responsible for carbohydrate metabolism, respiration, sporulation and dormancy, iron acquisition and metabolism, stress response and sulfur metabolism in the produced water samples as compared to the fracturing source water sample. These results suggest that the microbial community is responsive to changes in hydrocarbon content, induced stresses such as increase in temperature, addition of biocides, and an increase in concentration of dissolved salts such as iron and sulfur. The detection of genes affiliated with sodium ion coupled energetics exclusively in the produced water samples suggests the use of sodium ion based energetics by microorganisms in these sodium rich environments. Understanding the evolving metabolic capabilities of microbial communities in produced water will help the industry and its regulators improve environmental and economic sustainability of oil and gas extraction through more informed water management decisions.</p>
