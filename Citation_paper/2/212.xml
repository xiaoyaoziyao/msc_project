<abstract>
<p>Many cellular signaling processes are initiated by dimerization or oligomerization of membrane proteins. However, since the spatial scale of these interactions is below the diffraction limit of the light microscope, the dynamics of these interactions have been difficult to study on living cells. We have developed a novel high-speed hyperspectral microscope (HSM) to perform single particle tracking of up to 8 spectrally distinct species of quantum dots (QDs) at 27 frames per second. The distinct emission spectra of the QDs allows localization with ∼10 nm precision even when the probes are clustered at spatial scales below the diffraction limit. The capabilities of the HSM are demonstrated here by application of multi-color single particle tracking to observe membrane protein behavior, including: 1) dynamic formation and dissociation of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor dimers; 2) resolving antigen induced aggregation of the high affinity IgE receptor, FcεR1; 3) four color QD tracking while simultaneously visualizing GFP-actin; and 4) high-density tracking for fast diffusion mapping.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cellular signal transduction is regulated through the interactions and output of membrane receptors. However, the study of molecular-level protein-protein interactions in living cells continues to be a challenging goal in cell biology. While the nanometer-scale distribution of receptors can be observed using electron microscopy (EM), this technique is limited to fixed samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Wilson1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Veatch2">[6]</xref>. Super-resolution microscopy techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Veatch2">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Lidke1">[9]</xref> can also reveal nanometer-scale protein distributions, yet these measurements are inherently slow, making the observation of dynamic events difficult. Therefore, new live cell microscopy techniques are needed in order to determine the role of receptor dynamics in the regulation of cell signaling.</p>
<p>One method for studying the dynamics of membrane components is single particle tracking (SPT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Saxton1">[10]</xref>, in which a fluorescent or light scattering probe is attached to the component of interest and its position is recorded over time. The probe can be localized with precision much better than the diffraction limit (typically tens of nanometers) by fitting the spatial distribution of light intensity recorded to the point spread function (PSF) of the microscope <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Ober1">[11]</xref>. Connecting particle coordinates across frames generates particle trajectories that can be analyzed to deduce properties of the probe target or the membrane. Although SPT has been used extensively for characterizing membrane environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Alcor1">[12]</xref>, it has seen limited use for the study of protein interactions since the localization precision of the probe is greatly reduced when the particle spacing approaches that found in protein dimers or oligomers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Ram1">[13]</xref>. Simultaneous tracking of two spectrally distinct probes can be easily achieved using filter-based separation of the emission. Two-color SPT allows the spatially overlapping particles to be separated by emission spectrum, and in the case of isolated, two-color pairs, the localization precision is restored. This concept has been used for the study of interacting membrane proteins in several systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-LowNam1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Lidke2">[18]</xref>. Despite its advantages, two-color SPT has several limitations: 1) successful tracking requires each color of probe be present at a density of less than about 1 µm<sup>−2</sup>; 2) same-color dimers are as likely as two-color dimers; and 3) higher order oligomers cannot be easily resolved.</p>
<p>Here we describe a high-speed hyperspectral microscope (HSM) that is capable of resolving and tracking eight or more spectrally distinct fluorescent probes. A hyperspectral imaging system collects a region of the spectrum divided into many contiguous channels for each spatial element of the image. Our microscope design is based around the concept of a spectrally-resolved, line-scanning confocal microscope <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Sinclair1">[19]</xref>, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064320-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>. A laser focused to a line provides high excitation intensity in a region in and around the focal plane of the objective. The line geometry and the use of a confocal slit on the emission path rejects much of the out-of-focus light that is emitted from either fluorophores or sample auto-fluorescence, thereby providing optical sectioning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Pawley1">[20]</xref>. To create a two-dimensional (2D) hyperspectral image, the line is scanned across the sample plane in discrete steps (along the <italic>x</italic>-axis) and the camera captures a frame at each step. Each single camera capture consists of 64 pixels of 1D spatial information and 128 spectral channels. Therefore, a 2D hyperspectral image consists of a 3D (<italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic>,<italic>λ</italic>) data cube collected in these steps. The rate at which complete hyperspectral images can be captured is limited by the readout rate of the electron multiplying charge coupled device (EMCCD) camera and is 27 frames per second (fps) when scans are configured for 32 steps per image (each image is 32×64×128). In this configuration the camera is collecting approximately 900 images per second where each camera image corresponds to a single position of the excitation line. In the application of multi-color SPT (mcSPT), each hyperspectral image is analyzed to find the positions of the fluorescent probes and these positions are used to construct particle trajectories.</p>

<title>Conceptual diagram of microscope.</title>
<p>The excitation beam (optics not shown) is reflected by a dichroic mirror and forms a laser line focused at the sample plane by the objective, concentrating the excitation light to a small volume of diffraction limited width. Here, the white spheres in the sample represent fluorophores that remain mostly in the ground state while the colored spheres denote those which are excited. The emitted light passes through the dichroic mirror and into a spectrometer, which distributes the light onto an EMCCD camera such that each exposure captures information of wavelength and position along the line. The entrance slit on the spectrometer also serves to reject out-of-focus light, providing a semi-confocal ability for imaging at any depth in the sample. A scanning mirror (not shown) advances the line position by one back-projected pixel length on the sample and another exposure is acquired. One hyperspectral “frame” is a reconstructed series of these steps (performed in post processing) to form an image containing <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, and <italic>λ</italic>. A time series of these hyperspectral frames is acquired at 27 fps, providing spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution that enables localized single molecule tracking of multiple emitters within a given diffraction limited volume.

<p>We describe the design and performance of our instrument and the analysis process required for mcSPT. We then demonstrate the capabilities of the instrument through several proof-of-principle experiments by applying mcSPT to biological systems of interest in our laboratory. Specifically, we show that: 1) The increased labeling density afforded by mcSPT makes detection of rare and transient receptor interactions more efficient, as demonstrated in observations of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) dimerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-LowNam1">[14]</xref>; 2) The multiplexing capability of the HSM can be used for determination of antigen-induced FcεRI aggregate size based on spectral signature and therefore could be used for cluster size correlation with diffusion coefficient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Andrews1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Andrews2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Haaland1">[22]</xref>; 3) mcSPT can be used while simultaneously visualizing other membrane associated structures, which we demonstrate by performing mcSPT while imaging GFP-actin; and 4) High density tracking facilitated by mcSPT can be exploited for fast diffusion mapping of the cell membrane. Because of the advantages in speed, sensitivity and spectral imaging afforded by our HSM, it is likely that the instrument will find use in a wide variety of biological imaging studies and we briefly discuss a few of these other potential applications.</p>

<title>Microscope Design and Performance</title>
<p>The HSM described here can operate at a frame rate of up to 27 fps for an imaging area of 28 µm<sup>2</sup> while each spatial pixel collects 128 spectral channels. Our system is designed to span the spectral range from 500 to 750 nm. The system is built around a standard inverted microscope base (Olympus IX71) in order to facilitate live cell imaging. A single 488 nm wavelength laser (which is used to simultaneously excite all spectral species of QDs) is modified with a laser line generating lens (Edmund Optics) and other optics to provide a uniform (vertical) and diffraction limited (horizontal) line at the microscope focal plane. The laser line is scanned across the sample using a galvanometer controlled scanning mirror (Cambridge Research). Emission light is de-scanned and passes through a prism spectrometer and is imaged with a high-speed EMCCD camera (Andor iXon 860). The microscope design layout is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064320-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref> and a more detailed description of the instrument is given in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064320.s022">Text S1</xref></bold>. Synchronization of the camera and scanning mirror is achieved by using the camera as the master clock. Specific digital sequences are pre-programmed in a data acquisition card (NI PCIe-6343) and the camera fire signal is used to trigger the next output state. <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064320.s007">Figure S1</xref></bold> shows the overall instrument control schematic, and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064320.s008">Figure S2</xref></bold> provides a few example plots that illustrate the signal timing. When collecting a time series of hyperspectral images (four-dimensional data sets (<italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic>,<italic>λ</italic>,<italic>t</italic>)), the camera is set to collect a single kinetic series, and therefore absolute timing is preserved. Data is saved asynchronously as one file for each hyperspectral image.</p>

<p>The localization precision of single fluorophores is proportional to the square root of the number of photons captured <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Ober1">[11]</xref> and therefore, for throughput efficiency, a prism spectrometer is used as the dispersing element. Prism spectrometers have a higher transmission efficiency over a wide spectral range as compared with diffraction gratings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Lerner1">[23]</xref>, so they are more suitable for this application. The spectrometer is an aplanatic design <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Warren1">[24]</xref>, with a dispersion element that consists of a spherical wedge prism and a spherical concave mirror. The design was optimized using optical design software (Optics Software for Layout and Optimization, Lambda Research Corporation) to minimize distortion. Custom optical components were fabricated (Rainbow Optics, Eugene, Oregon USA) to the specifications of the optimized design. The details of the design (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064320.s009">Figure S3</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064320.s023">Text S2</xref></bold>) and the spectrometer distortion and dispersion (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064320.s010">Figure S4</xref></bold>) of the design are included in the supporting information. Spectral calibration was performed using a spectral calibration lamp (MIDL® Wavelength Calibration Lamp) and the 543 nm and 633 nm lines from HeNe lasers. There is no observable curvature in the spectral lines with respect to the spatial axis (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064320.s011">Figure S5</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>The measured 4D (<italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic>,<italic>z</italic>,<italic>λ</italic>) microscope point spread function (PSF) shows good agreement with that expected for a diffraction limited system (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064320.s012">Figure S6</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064320.s013">S7</xref></bold>, and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064320.s024">Text S3</xref></bold>). Localization of multi-fluorophore beads (TetraSpeck, Invitrogen) broken into spectral bins of 504–534, 562–611, and 641–712 nm show less than 15 nm of chromatic induced shift anywhere in the image (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064320.s014">Figure S8</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Custom graphical user interfaces (GUIs) were developed using MATLAB (Natick, Massachusetts USA) for data acquisition and live viewing of hyperspectral images (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064320.s015">Figure S9</xref></bold>). The data acquisition GUI allows for efficient adjustment and optimization of acquisition parameters for experiments. The live viewing GUI provides the experimentalist instantaneous feedback on sample quality and the ability to find a field of view and focus on the sample.</p>

<title>QD Localization and Trajectory Connection</title>
<p>Single particle tracking is carried out by the localization of single molecules and the subsequent building of trajectories from those localizations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Cheezum1">[25]</xref>.

(B) 3D representation of a single hyperspectral time frame with 3D boxes representing sub-volumes identified for further particle localization. Sum projections of the data onto each plane are used to represent the raw data (gray scale). Likewise, 2D projections of each 3D box onto each plane are used to highlight the sub-volumes. Fitting results for the colored sub-volumes (color corresponds to the spectral center of the box) in (B) are shown in (C), (D), and (E). In the top figures in (C), (D), and (E) red and green are sum projections of the raw data and fit respectively. Note that the color outlining (C), (D), and (E) correlate with the respective sub-volumes highlighted in (B) with the same color. The localized particles are represented by white ellipsoids in which the radius in each dimension shows 3 standard deviations in the estimated error in the fit using the Cramér Rao Bound and their projection onto each axis is represented by a gray ellipse. The bottom figures in (C), (D), and (E) show raw spectral features (black) and Gaussian fits (color corresponds to fit spectral emission peak).

<p>To characterize the imaging capability of the HSM, QDs are non-specifically adsorbed onto a glass coverslip and imaged at the fastest scan rate for this geometry. For the field of view collected in these images (64 vertical spatial pixels and 32 line steps; 28 µm<sup>2</sup>), the pixel dwell time was 1.14 ms and the frame rate was 27 fps. The spectral characteristics of individual QDs for 8 colors (commercially available from Invitrogen) are investigated in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064320.s018">Figure S12</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064320.s031">Table S2</xref></bold>. The procedure for localizing QDs using hyperspectral data is demonstrated with all 8 colors of QDs in a single acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064320-g003"><bold>Figures 3B–E</bold></xref>). See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">materials and methods</xref> for more details. The simultaneous localization of two highly spatially and spectrally overlapping QDs (QD585 and QD605) is highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064320-g003"><bold>Figures 3C and 3F</bold></xref>. Additionally, a total of four highly spatially overlapping QDs are localized simultaneously.

<title>Observation of Rare, Transient Events</title>
<p>Protein-protein interactions can be difficult or impossible to observe with single color SPT since the spacing of proteins at distances less than the diffraction limit make it difficult to discern the difference between merely close proximity and real interactions. Two-color tracking restores the ability to calculate separation and deduce dimerization state. Previously, we used two-color SPT to visualize and quantify EGFR homodimerization under various physiological conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-LowNam1">[14]</xref>. These studies required low labeling density such that capturing a sufficient number of dimerization events between two labeled receptors required a large amount of data. Multi-color SPT improves upon two-color SPT by increasing the overall labeling density and thereby increases the potential observation rate of rare events while reducing the probability of same color interactions. Using our HSM, we imaged 8 colors of QD-labeled Epidermal Growth Factor (QD-EGF) bound to EGFR expressed on live A431 cells. <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064320.s002">Video S2</xref></bold> shows the analysis results of a data set collected at 27 fps.

<title>Oligomer Dynamics</title>
<p>Previous studies of FcεRI have shown that receptor mobility is a function of antigen dose and valency, and consequently aggregate size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Andrews2">[21]</xref>. However, in these experiments, the size of aggregates could not be directly determined since a mixture of dark and QD-labeled IgE (QD-IgE) was used to maintain SPT density. Using the HSM to perform mcSPT of QD-IgE-FcεRI on live cells captures not only the dynamics of IgE-FcεRI complexes, but also reveals the number of proteins in the aggregate based on spectral signature. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064320-g005"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064320.s003">Video S3</xref></bold> show the results of mcSPT of QD-IgE-FcεRI approximately 7 minutes after the addition of a crosslinking agent (DNP<sub>3</sub>). Several long-lived complexes are observed that demonstrate correlated motion. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064320-g005"><bold>Figure 5A</bold></xref> highlights the observation of a trimer and dimer. Spectral separation is further beneficial for accurate quantification of diffusion of QD-IgE-FcεRI oligomeric complexes due to their high degree of spatial and spectral overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064320-g005"><bold>Figures 5B and 5C</bold></xref>). Note that the localization of the QDs in these complexes would not be possible using single color SPT represented by the gray scale projection in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064320-g005"><bold>Figures 5B and 5C</bold></xref>. The red ellipse in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064320-g005"><bold>Figure 5C</bold></xref> (upper left subfigure) is a QD655-IgE-FcεRI that comes in close proximity but does not interact with the observed dimer.

In a two color SPT experiment, the proximity of a third QD to an observed dimer would disrupt one of the trajectories in the dimer. The diffusion coefficients of the individual trimer and dimer seen in this example are 0.013 and 0.024 µm<sup>2</sup>/s, respectively.

<title>Interactions with Membrane Components</title>
<p>The dynamics of membrane proteins may be influenced by membrane-associated structures such as actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Andrews1">[17]</xref>, clathrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Wilson3">[30]</xref> or other microdomains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Kusumi1">[31]</xref> and interaction with such structures could be correlated with oligomerization state. Our HSM allows the simultaneous observations of several colors of QDs at the same time as other fluorescent probes that can be excited efficiently with 488 nm light, such as GFP. Here we demonstrate mcSPT using 4 colors of QD-IgE-FcεRI (605, 625, 655, and 705 nm) while simultaneously imaging GFP-actin. Imaging was performed on rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells transiently transfected with GFP-actin. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064320-g006"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref> (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064320.s004">Video S4</xref></bold>) provides observations that highlight several advantages of this technique. Comparison of the actin structure in the top and bottom images demonstrates how dynamic the actin structure is over the time course of this acquisition. Actin corralling of QD-IgE-FcεRI is also observed (red triangle and red circle in the bottom image). These results are consistent with previous reports of actin corralling first observed by tracking QD655-IgE-FcεRI with respect to GFP-actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Andrews1">[17]</xref>. However, these previous studies were limited to tracking in total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) at the adherent surface since wide field imaging of actin structures at the apical surface was insufficient and point scanning confocal was too slow for tracking. Using the HSM, we can perform fast confocal imaging while simultaneously tracking single quantum dots. Moreover, the increased number of spectrally distinct QDs allow for tracking of many receptors simultaneously such that their interactions within the actin domains can be observed. The mobility of the dimer complex (0.004 µm<sup>2</sup>/s; purple blue diamond and red square, top and bottom) is less than that of highlighted monomers (0.044 µm<sup>2</sup>/s). A transition of the mobility of a monomer from relatively immobile (red triangle, top) to relatively mobile (red triangle, bottom) is observed. Crossing trajectories are appropriately connected due to the spectral information (red triangle and yellow star).</p>

<title>Fast Membrane Diffusion Mapping</title>
<p>Labeling with multiple colors enables SPT at densities of several particles per square micron. By binning squared displacement both temporally and spatially, high-density mcSPT can be used to probe local receptor mobility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Manley1">[32]</xref>. The uncertainty in the diffusion coefficient scales as approximately <italic>D</italic>*(<italic>A</italic>*<italic>ρ</italic>*<italic>n</italic>)<sup>−1/2</sup> where <italic>D</italic> is the diffusion coefficient, <italic>A</italic> is area, <italic>ρ</italic> is particle density and <italic>n</italic> is the number of time frames (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064320.s028">Text S7</xref></bold>); therefore, higher density allows better spatial and/or temporal resolution in the diffusion map. In a similar manner, high density mcSPT also allows global changes in protein diffusion to be observed quickly. To demonstrate this, a high density mcSPT experiment was devised in which the relative labeling density for 8 colors of QD-IgE-FcεRI was refined to provide similar high density labeling for each color of QD. The labeling density achieved here is ∼2.4 particles per µm<sup>2</sup> which to the authors' knowledge is higher density than any previously reported SPT method. Crosslinker (DNP-BSA) was added ∼20 seconds into the acquisition and a corresponding change in the estimated instantaneous diffusion coefficient is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064320-g007"><bold>Figure 7A</bold></xref>). Due to the increased labeling density, this instantaneous change in mobility observed from a single acquisition of a single cell correlates well with that observed in a previous study that required the combined analysis of multiple (∼10) SPT experiments of single color of QD-IgE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Andrews1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Andrews2">[21]</xref>.

<title>Other Imaging Modalities</title>
<p>Our fast, line scanning HSM has the potential to be used for many other imaging modalities that are not explicitly demonstrated. Some of these modalities are variants of combinations of the demonstrated approaches. mcSPT could be performed to image several types of proteins labeled with various permutations of QD colors. (e.g. two colors on one membrane receptor and two on another). mcSPT could also be performed simultaneously with more than one additional marker, such as both GFP and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), which could be separated from each other using multivariate curve resolution (MCR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Haaland1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>Since the instrument is a line scanning system with optical sectioning capability, the microscope can be used to obtain hyperspectral <italic>z</italic>-slices of a sample.

<p>Given the ability of the instrument to image single molecules with high temporal and spectral resolution, the HSM could be used with a variety of probes that report on local environment via spectra <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Balkay1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Parasassi1">[36]</xref>, for single-molecule, multi-color Foerster resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Shcherbakova1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Milles1">[39]</xref> or for studying the fluorophores themselves, particularly QDs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Lee2">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Hoyer1">[42]</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we have detailed the development of a novel hyperspectral microscope that provides an unprecedented combination of speed, sensitivity and a spectral detection. Our HSM design provides acquisition rates of 27 fps over a 28 µm<sup>2</sup> field of view with 128 spectral channels. These features allow the determination of stoichiometry and dynamics of small oligomers, which cannot be measured using any other currently available techniques. We have demonstrated these capabilities of our HSM by multi-color single QD tracking and diffusion mapping of membrane protein dynamics. While EM or super-resolution techniques do provide a nanometer-scale image of protein distributions and clustering, they cannot provide information on protein diffusion or clustering dynamics. One variant of super-resolution that captures dynamics uses SPT of sequentially photo-activated fluorescent proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Manley1">[32]</xref>, but it still requires long acquisition times to build up a diffusion map and cannot track a single protein or aggregate for more than a few seconds and cannot be used to identify interactions.</p>
<p>The maximum speed is limited by the EMCCD readout rate and is achieved by imaging only 64 of 128 pixels in the vertical shift direction. In this configuration, the maximum frame rate scales directly with the image area. A higher frame rate or larger field of view could be achieved by rotating the camera such that spectral binning in the vertical shift direction would increase frame rate. This would most benefit fast, 3D imaging of conventional fluorophores. We estimate that the imaging area could be increased by a factor of two while maintaining similar signal to noise levels with a state-of-the-art scientific complementary metal oxide (sCMOS) camera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Huang2">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Long1">[45]</xref>. However, pixel-to-pixel noise and gain variation of sCMOS cameras may complicate particle localization and MCR analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Jones2">[46]</xref>.</p>
<p>Several other spectral imaging methods could be envisioned for performing mcSPT. In principle, a widefield microscope could be used with a series of dichroic and emission filters to setup an arbitrarily large number of spectral channels. This approach has been used for two color <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-LowNam1">[14]</xref> and four color imaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Arnspang1">[47]</xref>. However, for image registration better than 20 nm, which is required for studying protein-protein interactions, careful mapping between all channels must be periodically performed using multispectral reference beads. In contrast, our spectrometer system provides less than 15 nm shift in spatial localization due to chromatic aberration from 500 nm to 750 nm (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064320.s014">Figure S8</xref></bold>). Another recently described approach for wide field, fluorescence spectral imaging uses an image mapping spectrometer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Elliott1">[48]</xref>. This apparatus would seem not to suffer from channel registration problems and although has only been demonstrated at ∼7 fps, would in principle be capable of video rate imaging. Of course, these wide field approaches do not provide a mechanism for rejecting out of focus light and could therefore suffer as compared to a line-scanning system when imaging in an environment with high cellular auto-fluorescence or other background.</p>
<p>Spectral imaging capabilities can be found on many commercial point scanning microscopes as well as custom built point-scanning hyperspectral systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Lerner1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Sinclair2">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Esposito1">[49]</xref>. However the finite lifetime of fluorophores limits photon yield even at arbitrarily high laser power and leads to a practical limit for SPT in point scanning systems. For a region of interest that is 128×128 spatial pixels, with a desired localization precision of ∼10 nm, the maximum point scanning frame rate is ∼2 fps and the maximum line scanning frame rate is ∼250 fps (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064320.s029">Text S8</xref></bold>). In terms of achieving a maximum area scanned for a given specific frame rate of 30 fps (33 ms per frame) and with the same 10 nm localization precision, these limits are ∼512 um<sup>2</sup>/33 ms for organic fluorophores (τ = 2 ns) and as low as 51 um<sup>2</sup>/33 ms for QDs (τ = 20 ns) for a point scanning system. The latter value is fairly close to the area covered by this instrument when acquiring at 30 fps, and does not include consideration of spectral data acquisition. In addition, any non-linear photobleaching, photo-destruction or long-lived dark states would further reduce these values in practice. In comparison, a line-scanning system has the advantage of parallel observations along the spatial dimension and therefore gives an additional factor equal to the number of pixels that are simultaneously observed.</p>
<p>QDs have a broad excitation spectrum, narrow emission spectrum and high photo-stability. All of these properties are taken advantage of for mcSPT using our HSM. However, QDs do have practical limiting properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Lee2">[40]</xref> such as fluorescence intermittency, the potential for non-fluorescent QDs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Yao1">[50]</xref> and a difficultly in producing monovalent probes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Mittal1">[51]</xref>. For example, the presence of non-fluorescent QDs leads to the possibility of underestimating the oligomer size of complexes in mcSPT experiments. Consideration must also be taken when using biotin-protein∶streptavidin-QD conjugation schemes since unlabeled protein could also lead to underestimation of oligomer size. Consequently, the oligomers identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064320-g005"><bold>Figures 5</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064320-g006"><bold>6</bold></xref> should be considered as minimal dimers and trimers. Contribution from non-biotynilated protein can be minimized by purification on streptavidin resin prior to conjugation with the QDs. The dark fraction of QDs for each spectral species can be measured and used in a statistical analysis of the properties under study as a function of oligomer size. mcSPT could also be performed with other probes that may have overlapping spectra, such as non-blinking QDs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Chen1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Marchuk1">[53]</xref>, ‘Cornell dots’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Ow1">[54]</xref> or other systems that use combinations of organic fluorophores and could have the benefit of reduced or non-existent fluorescence intermittency.</p>
<p>In summary, we have developed a high-speed hyperspectral microscope and the required analysis software to perform simultaneous SPT of up to 8 spectrally distinct QDs at video rate. We have provided a description of the instrument, software, and several proof-of-principle applications of the HSM. The applications presented in this manuscript (mcSPT, mcSPT with GFP background, high density mcSPT, and 3D scanning) highlight how the HSM can provide unique insight into dynamic cellular events.</p>

<p>The quantum dots (Invitrogen Corporation Qdot® 525, 565, 585, 605, 625, 655, 705, and 800) were each diluted to 50 pM in 1× phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then mixed together in equal volumes. 300 ul of this mixture was then added to each well in an 8-well chamber. 10 ul of 2 M NaCl (aqueous) was then added to each well and then incubated at 4°C for up to 8 hours to allow the quantum dots to attach to the glass. The solution was then replaced by 1× PBS. 250 frames of data (providing <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, and <italic>λ</italic> information) were acquired at 27 frames/sec over an area of 28 µm<sup>2</sup> (the intended scan rate for our typical live cell imaging) with an excitation laser line intensity of ∼1000 W/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>Samples were maintained at 34–36°C using an objective heater (Bioptechs, Butler, PA, USA) for imaging.

<title>Single Particle Tracking (Preprocessing, Localizations, and Trajectory Building)</title>
<p>Immediately prior to the acquisition of each HSM image, 1000 frames of dark images were acquired for background correction. The mean dark image was subtracted from each frame of the HSM image. The spectrometer was aligned so that several columns of spectral pixels are dark due to a long pass filter.. The mean value of a dark column of pixels was subtracted from the SPT image to correct a baseline offset. The HSM image was then multiplied by a calibrated gain factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-VanVliet1">[56]</xref> to convert arbitrary pixel counts to photons.</p>
<p>The steps in SPT in an HSM image are similar to steps used in traditional SPT algorithms: image segmentation, single particle localization, and trajectory building. Uniform and maximum filtering procedures outlined in previous work by Huang et. al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064320-Huang1">[28]</xref> for two dimensions are expanded to three dimensions (<italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic>,<italic>λ</italic>) and used to identify centers for sub-volumes in which to localize single molecules. The empirically determined sub-volume size used for single molecule localization in this work was 25 spectral pixels by 7 spatial pixels by 7 spatial pixels. A 3D Gaussian PSF/spectral model and Poisson noise model (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064320.s016">Figure S10</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064320.s025">Text S4</xref></bold>) were used to model the spatial and spectral features of individual QDs.

An artifact of using a line-scanning instrument is that blinking during the scanning of a single QD causes errors in QD localization in the scan direction (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064320.s019">Figure S13</xref></bold>).

Column 1 shows spectral features of individual QDs (colored lines; 5 randomly selected spectra) and the ensemble of all individual QDs (black line; total number of spectra used to compute each ensemble is included in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064320.s031">Table S2</xref></bold>). Column 2 contains histograms of fit spectral emission peaks (<italic>θ<sub>λ</sub></italic>) identified by 3D Gaussian fitting (<italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic>,<italic>λ</italic>) for individual QDs. Red ticks indicate the expected emission peak for each QD specie. Note that the expected emission peak for QD800 is significantly different from the histogram. This is attributed to the spectral range of the camera (i.e. only the tail of the spectrum is observed on the camera). Column 3 contains histograms of the fit standard deviation in the spectral dimension (<italic>θ<sub>σλ</sub></italic>) identified by 3D Gaussian fitting for individual QDs. Column 4 contains histograms of fit photons per frame (<italic>θ<sub>σλ</sub></italic>) for individual QDs. <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064320.s030">Table S1</xref></bold> includes further description of the model parameters.

<p><bold>QD localization and blinking.</bold> (A) Localizations for a single QD605 overlaid on the sum projection of raw data. Coloration of localizations corresponds to the localized emission peak (color bar). The estimated intensity (left axis; blue) and spectral emission peak (right axis; green) are shown over time (∼3.8 fps) in (B). Note the blue shifting of the QD is observed in (A) and (B). Localizations were binned by intensity in (C) and the standard deviation of the localization parameters were compared to the square root of the CRB in (D), (E), and (F). The standard deviation in the line dimension (E) corresponds well to the theoretical lower bound. The standard deviation in the scanning dimension (D) and the spectral dimension (F) do not correspond well with theory. This is attributed to QD blinking during the line scan and QD blue shifting respectively.</p>

Trajectories were subsequently built either utilizing (solid colored lines) or ignoring spectral information (solid black lines). Localizations are shown in ellipsoids (size of the ellipsoid corresponds to 3× the estimated localization accuracy), and solid colored lines correspond to the connected trajectories. Dashed colored lines represent the ‘true’ simulated trajectories. The black line with circles identifies trajectories built from connecting localizations without spectral information. Black diamonds represent positions were tracks jump from one true underlying track to another.</p>
