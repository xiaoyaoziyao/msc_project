<abstract>
<p>Cells of the innate and adaptive immune system are key factors in the progression of atherosclerotic plaque, leading to plaque instability and rupture, potentially resulting in acute atherothrombotic events such as coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral arterial disease. Here, we describe the cloning, expression, purification, and immunoreactivity assessment of a recombinant single-chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from a human anti-αIIbβ3 antibody (HuAb) selected to target atheromatous lesions for the presence of platelets. Indeed, platelets within atheroma plaques have been shown to play a role in inflammation, in platelet-leucocyte aggregates and in thrombi formation and might thus be considered relevant biomarkers of atherosclerotic progression. The DNA sequence that encodes the anti-αIIbβ3 TEG4 scFv previously obtained from a phage-display selection on activated platelets, was inserted into the eukaryote vector (pPICZαA) in fusion with a tag sequence encoding 2 cysteines useable for specific probes grafting experiments. The recombinant protein was expressed at high yields in <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> (30 mg/L culture). The advantage of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>pastoris</italic> as an expression system is the production and secretion of recombinant proteins in the supernatant, ruling out the difficulties encountered when scFv are produced in the cytoplasm of bacteria (low yield, low solubility and reduced affinity). The improved conditions allowed for the recovery of highly purified and biologically active scFv fragments ready to be grafted in a site-directed way to nanoparticles for the imaging of atherosclerotic plaques involving inflammatory processes and thus at high risk of instability.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease associated with the formation of unstable thrombosis-prone atheroma plaques made of large lipid cores, thin fibrous cap and inflammatory cell infiltrates within the walls of arteries.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref001">1</xref>] Atherosclerotic plaque rupture is the mechanistic cause of about 75% of all sudden and often fatal heart attacks.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref002">2</xref>] As the risk of plaque rupture is more related to the plaque contents than to the plaque size, molecular imaging modalities have risen as a new imperative. Current studies tend towards the development of non-invasive targeted methods to assess the cellular components that underlie the risk of rupture.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref004">4</xref>] Molecular imaging requires highly sensitive and specific probes made of a signal detection compound and an affinity ligand for targeting. The affinity ligand should be able to recognize molecules and cells over-expressed during the course of atherogenesis. Inflammation is a well-recognized pathophysiological process involving both innate and adaptive immune cells.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref005">5</xref>] Recruitment of monocytes in the vascular wall and macrophage differentiation and proliferation represent a hallmark in the pathology of atherosclerotic lesions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref006">6</xref>] They contribute to the processes that underlie atherogenesis such as lipid accumulation, secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, extracellular matrix remodelling. Moreover, the observation of activation and oligoclonal expansion of T cells has suggested the presence of inciting antigens (Ags) that sustain T cell recruitment within coronary lesions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref007">7</xref>] B cells also play a pro or anti-atherogenic role depending on the subtypes (B1(a) or B2), and in atherosclerosis they accumulate both in the atherosclerotic intima and associated adventitia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref010">10</xref>] More recently, platelets have come to the forefront as partners of macrophages, T cells and B cells in inflammation and immune responses. They are now recognized as key players in innate and adaptive immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref012">12</xref>] and notably shown to modulate the T-effector/T-regulator balance via the CD40 ligand.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref014">14</xref>] Platelet-derived CD40 ligand has also been reported to support B-cell differentiation and immunoglobulin class switching in mice.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref015">15</xref>] Several cytokines released by activated platelets have been demonstrated to modulate monocyte and macrophage function.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref016">16</xref>] Moreover platelet—leukocyte interactions largely contribute to OxLDL uptake and foam cell formation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref017">17</xref>] A recent study has underlined the presence of platelets not only in thrombi and intraplaque hemorrhage but also in atheroma burden, around necrotic areas and neovessels, shedding light on the rationale for targeting platelets within atherosclerotic lesions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref018">18</xref>]</p>
<p>Today, antibodies are used for several applications in research, diagnostics, and therapy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref019">19</xref>] Technology improvements are focused on several approaches to manufacturing recombinant human antibodies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref020">20</xref>] Moreover, <italic>in vitro</italic> selection technologies such as antibody phage display or ribosomal display have accelerated the generation of these recombinant human antibodies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref023">23</xref>]</p>
<p>To develop a novel non-invasive targeting approach for atheroma, our team previously selected, using <italic>in vitro</italic> phage display biotechnology on activated platelets, a phage-scFv fully human antibody (HuAb) specific to the αIIbβ3 integrin, which is an integrin only expressed on platelets and not on other immune cells.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref024">24</xref>] This human antibody was further processed as a whole human IgG<sub>4</sub> molecule in baculovirus system.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref018">18</xref>] We proved the maintenance of the bioactivity after grafting onto superparamagnetic nanoparticles dedicated to MRI imaging. However, the chemical functionalization was hard to proceed, time-consuming and we did not succeed in grafting more than one HuAb onto each nanoparticle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref018">18</xref>]. To overcome these drawbacks and obtain a better conjugation ratio, another type of protein engineering has been applied to reduce the probe size. A scFv protein composed of the heavy (VH) and light (VL) chains of an antibody linked with a flexible peptide, has been constructed by recombinant DNA technology. The diameter of scFv fragments (5 nm), one-fifth the size of whole IgG, is more suitable for functionalizing relatively small nanoparticles. Compared to much larger forms of antibodies such as Fab, Fab’2 and IgG, scFv have lower retention times in non-target tissues and exhibit more rapid blood clearance and better penetration into targeted lesions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref025">25</xref>] Moreover, this recombinant form can be generated with tags for purification and site-specific attachment via engineered thiols to avoid loss of bioactivity. There are a variety of recombinant production systems for the generation of scFvs ranging from bacteria, filamentous fungi, insect cell lines to transgenic plants.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref026">26</xref>] More specifically, studies reported the production of an anti-platelets scFv antibody in transient mammalian cells system (e.g, freestyle HEK 293F cells).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref026">26</xref>] However, transient antibody production appears more suitable for small-scale production in antibody screening. Here, TEG4 HuAb needs to be stably expressed as scFv fragments in a quantity so that purification, characterization and further grafting of isolated recombinant fragments could be readily accomplished. Hence, TEG4 HuAb was processed in <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic>. The choice of production in yeast cells was guided by previous experiments where biological activity could only be recovered in the cytoplasm of cells when using <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> as a host expression system. Indeed, despite improvements in fedbatch fermentation production, a proportion of inactive scFv remained in the total purified population.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref027">27</xref>] From this point of view, the <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> expression system is an attractive way due to its ability to secrete a large amount of recombinant protein in the supernatant, thereby facilitating the purification steps.</p>
<p>The aim of the study was thus to produce highly purified and biologically active scFv fragments in a suitable yeast cell expression modality. The biochemical characteristics of the anti-αIIbβ3 scFv were evaluated by ELISA, affinity binding analyses, flow cytometry against platelets and immunohistochemistry (IHC) on atheroma plaques from animal models and human coronary sections. These scFv fragments are ready to be grafted in a site-directed way to nanoparticles for the imaging of atherosclerotic plaques where inflammatory and immune processes increase the risk of instability.</p>

<p>Adult male New Zealand rabbits (NZW), weighting from 2.5 kg to 3.0 kg, were obtained from Charles Rivers Laboratories (St Germain sur l’Arbresle, France).</p>
<p>In order to mimic atherosclerosis that develop in humans, rabbits were fed a fat atherogenic diet including 0.3% cholesterol for 8 months and were subjected to surgeries to allow the formation of complex plaques with intramural thrombi. A first surgery was performed to remove endothelial cells from the thoracic until the abdominal aorta using a Fogarty catheter (Fogarty 4F; Edwards Lifesciences). The second surgery consists in an angioplasty using an expandable latex balloon (Maxxum, Boston Scientific; 20 mm long, diameter of 4.5 mm) under radioscopic guidance from the region of renal arteries to iliac bifurcation. Surgeries were performed under anesthesia by intramuscular administration of 20 mg/kg ketamine and 2 mg/kg xylazin. Anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane gas (0.25% to 0.35%). As a preventive anti-thrombotic treatment, 1000 μI of heparine (Héparine Choay, Sanofi Synthélabo) was infused. After surgery 100 mg aspirine (Aspégic injectable, Sanofi Synthélabo) was administered as analgesia. Aortas from untreated rabbits and balloon-injured aortas from hypercholesterolemic rabbits were extracted from the aortic arch to the iliac bifurcation, washed and fractioned in order to solubilize tissue proteins in T-PER (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or HSB (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4; 137 mM NaCl; 1% NP-40 (v/v); 2 mM EDTA; 1 mM PMSF; protease inhibitors cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France) lysis buffer.

ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice were fed a high-cholesterol diet for 21 weeks to allow for the development of atherosclerotic lesions, afterward they were terminally anaesthetized using a lethal dose of isoflurane. The chest was opened and the aorta retrieved from the aortic arch to the iliac bifurcation. The lesions-rich areas were subsequently isolated, fixed and embedded in paraffin. New Zealand white rabbits were prepared as described in Methods, section 8.</p>
<p>Human coronary arteries were harvested from patients with end-stage heart failure having undergone heart transplantation. All of the clinical interventions took place at Haut-Lévèque Hospital (Pessac, France). All work with tissues from human subjects had been approved by the CPP committee (Comité de Protection des Personnes Sud-Ouest et Outre Mer) of Bordeaux and from the Research Ministry in France (Authorization number DC -2016- 2724). The CPP committee waived the need for patient written consent because surgical waste no longer attached to the person is considered "RES NULLIUS ". Patients were informed by the clinicians; if they did not express their opposition to research, the de-identified samples were immediately processed and embedded in paraffin.</p>
<p>Paraffin-embedded sections of arterial tissue from mouse, rabbit or human were used in IHC experiments. The following antibodies were tested on sections from each specie: TEG4-2c scFv (human fragment antibody, tested between 20 and 40 μg/ml), anti-CD41 (anti-αIIb rabbit antibody, working dilution 1:200, Abcam, France), AP2 (anti-αIIbβ3 mouse antibody, 10 μg/mL), RAM11 (mouse antibody, working dilution 1:50) and PGM1 (mouse antibody, working dilution 10ug/ml) anti-CD68 antibodies targeting rabbit and human macrophages respectively (Dako, Les Ulis, France).</p>
<p>Paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinised, rehydrated, and heat mediated antigen retrieval was performed with Tris-EDTA pH 9 buffer following the specifications of Abcam, Paris, France (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.abcam.com/ps/pdf/protocols/ihc_p.pdf‎" xlink:type="simple">www.abcam.com/ps/pdf/protocols/ihc_p.pdf‎</ext-link>). Endogenous peroxidase was then blocked with 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in water, for 15 min. After washing in PBS 1X + 0.025% Triton (PBST), nonspecific binding was blocked with PBS 1X + 0.2% Triton + 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature.</p>
<p>Afterwards, antibodies were applied overnight at 4°C, diluted at 20 μg/mL in PBS 1X + 1% BSA. The following day, three washes with PBST were performed. To detect TEG4-2c scFv fragments, an HRP-conjugated antibody specific to 6His (working dilutions 1:250) was applied to the sections for 1 h at room temperature. HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies specific to (1) rabbit IgG H+L (Beckman Coulter), (2) mouse IgG H+L (Beckman Coulter) were respectively applied for commercial primary (1) anti-CD41, (2) RAM-11, PGM1 and AP2 antibodies.</p>
<p>After a further three washes with PBST, staining was performed by adding the peroxidase substrate diaminobenzidine (DAB substrate kit, Eurobio/ABCys, Les Ulis, France) with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.

<p>A fed-batch phase was initiated by adding methanol every 12 h to induce the scFv production. To optimize the efficiency of scFv production during the 4 last days, the methanol feed frequency was every 6 h. Following each substrate addition event, there was a sharp increase in agitation indicating the active consumption of substrate and sustainable growth of cells. Stirring, which again diminished upon substrate consumption, was raised following the consecutive methanol injection. During the fed-batch phase, a linear increase in yeast biomass was observed 24 h after induction. A growth rate of 0.23 g L<sup>-1</sup>h<sup>-1</sup> was maintained during 5 days; the cell density was also increased by a 4.3 fold and reached 35 g/L (dry weight).</p>

<p>The eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170305.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), which revealed a major band of 35 kDa from the elution step fractions, corresponding to the expected molecular mass of recombinant TEG4-2c scFv. A weaker band of 75 kDa was also present in this lane, but the mass spectroscopy analysis revealed that TEG4-2c scFv was the major protein present in this fraction (data not shown). This data strongly suggests that the higher molecular weight protein was indeed TEG4-2c scFv dimer.</p>
<p>The elution fraction was dialyzed against PBS buffer. The SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170305.g003">Fig 3B</xref>-E<sub>PBS</sub>) shows the purified TEG4-2c scFv as a single thick band with an estimated purity higher than 80%. The profile of TEG4-2c scFv into PBS buffer (used for ELISA and affinity measurement) is similar to the elution fraction (E) obtained at the end of IMAC. The final overall yield of TEG4-2c was 0.7 mg/mL; it represents 70% of initial product. However, upon SDS-PAGE analysis, it was observed that some amount of our protein of interest was also lost in the flowthrough and washing steps.</p>

<p>This second set of experiments performed using the Octet instrument aimed at determining the interactions between TEG4-2c scFv and blood platelets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170305.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). This is more informative because this strategy allows evaluating the binding on αIIbβ3 in its natural conformation. TEG4-2c scFv immobilized through an anti-6His coating on an optical fiber based sensor was immersed in a solution of platelets (seven different concentrations were used) contained in the well of a 96- well plate. The plate is shaken during reading to create an "orbital flow". The different platelet concentrations, from 5x10<sup>5</sup> to 5x10<sup>8</sup>/ml, were converted into integrin αIIbβ3 molarities by taking into account the number of αIIbβ3 per platelet (50 000). Controls with no scFv allowed checking for non-specific binding of the platelets on the sensors. These controls were subtracted from the curves obtained with TEG4-2c scFv. Other controls were also performed with no platelets (only buffer), assessing the signal drift due to the potential release of scFv from sensors.</p>
<p>Octet experiments showed good interactions between TEG4-2c scFv and platelets at nanomolar concentrations superior to 0.4 nM. No Kd could be calculated because no dissociation was observed. However, considering the binding at 0.8 and 4 nM, the affinity should be in the nanomolar range.</p>

<title>Discussion &amp; Conclusion</title>
<p>In the present study, TEG4-2c scFv was expressed at high-level in <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> using a fed-batch fermentation system monitored by pO<sub>2</sub> level. We produced the TEG4 scFv with cysteine tags at the end of the C-terminal sequence for site-specific conjugation to contrast agents, precluding the loss of reactivity potentially occurring when the grafting process affects antigen-recognition sites. TEG4 scFv had been previously expressed in <italic>E coli</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref027">27</xref>] Unfortunately, despite optimization tests leading to high yields of cytoplasmic production, proteins also frequently accumulated into inclusion bodies (data not shown). In bacterial systems, many scFv can be produced into the periplasmic space but they are obtained with a very low yield. Higher levels of production can be achieved in inclusion bodies, with the limitation of the presence of insoluble scFv aggregates and the need for subsequent <italic>in vitro</italic> folding that make the use of this bacterial system not attractive for the large scale production of scFv. In addition, many authors have described that the final yield of scFv was only a small percentage of produced proteins with a low specificity for targets.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref034">34</xref>]</p>
<p>So we chose to use the <italic>Pichia</italic> yeast as an alternative expression system. Indeed, <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> is an attractive system for low cost-effective large-scale production of heterologous proteins. This type of production, characterized by the secretion of the protein of interest into the culture medium, can be easily scaled up and reach a GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) status. The concentration of highly pure TEG4-2c scFv obtained after one chromatography step (IMAC) was up to 600 μg/mL. A production of 30 mg scFv per liter of culture was achieved. This value was lower than that obtained for an scFv anti-carcinoembryonic antigen,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref033">33</xref>] but in accordance with the yields obtained for the majority of Fab and antibody fragments expressed in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>pastoris</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref037">37</xref>] and sufficient for grafting purposes.</p>
<p>This new scFv format with cysteines included for grafting purposes was tested by ELISA, cytometry and IHC and all the experiments concurred to a specific recognition of platelets, from human or animal model origin and of atheroma issuing from coronary biopsies or animal lesional tissues. Bio-layer interferometry was used for evaluating the affinity of TEG4-2c scFv against platelets because this approach is more relevant than SPR analysis on purified antigen to mimic the <italic>in vivo</italic> behavior. No real Kd value could be extracted from the curves because of an absence of dissociation. This could be explained by the rebinding of the same platelet on the immobilized ligand because of the presence of 50 000 αIIbβ3 per platelet. Indeed, when the platelet is captured on the surface, one αIIbβ3 can dissociate while another re-binds on the scFv. As a consequence the off-rate is slower than it would be by using isolated αIIbβ3. Nevertheless, the bio-layer interferometry underlines a good affinity of TEG4-2c scFv for platelets with recognition in the nanomolar range. Moreover, the flow cytometry results with PRP are in favor of a preferential recognition of activated platelets. This approach, compared to ELISA assays or cytometry performed on washed platelets is the only one that allows recognition in physiological conditions.</p>
<p>The rationale for targeting activated platelets is that they are highly trapped within atherosclerotic lesions not only in thrombi and intraplaque hemorrhage but also in the atheroma burden, around necrotic areas and neovessels, mainly because of the presence of leaky vessels, blood extravasation and haemorrhage.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref018">18</xref>] Preferential recognition of activated platelets is to be considered to avoid <italic>in vivo</italic> elimination of the probe by circulating resting platelets.</p>
<p>An important point to be underlined is that scFv TEG4-2c recognizes human platelets as well as murine or rabbit platelets. The use of a human antibody able to target epitopes on the integrin shared by animal models and humans is of particular interest for pre-clinical studies in animal models of the disease and for direct transfer into the clinic. The use of an antibody of human origin is appealing, considering the need for repeated injections in humans to follow the progression of the pathology. Indeed, the human scFv should limit the induction of anti-antibodies in patients as compared with murine origin; it also avoids any additional humanization step that could impair the reactivity. This antibody equipped with cysteine tags is now ready to be used to functionalize contrast agents for MRI to serve as imaging agents for atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>In conclusion, even if the production of antibody fragments by <italic>P</italic>. <italic>pastoris</italic> is not always a success story,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170305.ref038">38</xref>] our findings demonstrated that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>pastoris</italic> provided TEG4-2c scFv at a high concentration without aggregates and claiming a good purity. Its functionality against activated platelets and atheroma tissues was proven, paving the way for the success of grafting tests. Our results definitely point out the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>pastoris</italic> expression system as an adapted tool to produce scFv for use in diagnostic or therapeutic applications as well.</p>
