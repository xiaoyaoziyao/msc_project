          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Exposure of human populations to ambient particulate matter (PM) air pollution significantly contributes to the mortality attributable to ischemic cardiovascular events. We reported that mice treated with intratracheally instilled PM develop a prothrombotic state that requires the release of IL-6 by alveolar macrophages. We sought to determine whether exposure of mice to PM increases the levels of PAI-1, a major regulator of thrombolysis, via a similar or distinct mechanism.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods and Principal Findings</title>
          <p>Adult, male C57BL/6 and IL-6 knock out (IL-6<sup>−/−</sup>) mice were exposed to either concentrated ambient PM less than 2.5 µm (CAPs) or filtered air 8 hours daily for 3 days or were exposed to either urban particulate matter or PBS via intratracheal instillation and examined 24 hours later. Exposure to CAPs or urban PM resulted in the IL-6 dependent activation of coagulation in the lung and systemically. PAI-1 mRNA and protein levels were higher in the lung and adipose tissue of mice treated with CAPs or PM compared with filtered air or PBS controls. The increase in PAI-1 was similar in wild-type and IL-6<sup>−/−</sup> mice but was absent in mice treated with etanercept, a TNF-α inhibitor. Treatment with etanercept did not prevent the PM-induced tendency toward thrombus formation.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>Mice exposed to inhaled PM exhibited a TNF-α-dependent increase in PAI-1 and an IL-6-dependent activation of coagulation. These results suggest that multiple mechanisms link PM-induced lung inflammation with the development of a prothrombotic state.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>There is a well-defined link between acute exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) and morbidity and mortality from ischemic cardiovascular events including acute myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Brook1">[1]</xref>. In the past several decades, the institution of pollution control measures has led to significant reductions in mean and peak PM levels in most parts of the developed world <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Brook1">[1]</xref>. Nevertheless, in more recent population-based cohorts, investigators have observed a persistent contribution of PM to mortality from ischemic cardiovascular events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Pope1">[2]</xref>. The mechanisms by which PM exposure increases the risk of ischemic cardiovascular events are incompletely understood. Several groups of investigators have reported that humans and rodents exposed to PM develop an enhanced tendency toward thrombosis and impaired fibrinolysis in the first 24 hours after the exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Ghio1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Graff1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Ghio2">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Ghio3">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Mutlu1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Soberanes1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Bonzini1">[9]</xref>. This time course is consistent with the lag time of PM-induced mortality reported in population based cohort studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Brook1">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Both humans and rodents exposed to PM develop pulmonary inflammation characterized by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid pleocytosis accompanied by the local and systemic release of cytokines. Investigators examining the consequences of PM exposure in humans and rodents have consistently observed an increase in serum levels of IL-6 or its transcriptional target CRP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Ruckerl1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Ruckerl2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Ljungman1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Shoenfelt1">[13]</xref>. Consistent with these findings, we found that the release of IL-6 from alveolar macrophages was required for the development of a prothrombotic state in mice exposed to intratracheally instilled PM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Mutlu2">[14]</xref>. Following controlled exposures of men with stable coronary artery disease to diesel exhaust, Mills et al observed evidence of worsened myocardial ischemia accompanied by reduced endothelial release of plasminogen activator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Mills1">[15]</xref>. These results suggest that impaired fibrinolysis might also contribute to the observed increased risk in ischemic cardiovascular events in PM exposed populations. In this study, we sought to determine whether: (1) acute PM exposure via inhalation is sufficient to increase the systemic levels of PAI-1, the major regulator of fibrinolysis (2) whether exposure to PM via inhalation activates coagulation through the same mechanism we observed after exposure to intratracheally instilled PM and (3) whether similar mechanisms underlie both the induction of PAI-1 and the activation of coagulation following exposure to PM.</p>

      <p>PM<sub>2.5</sub> increases white adipose tissue transcription of PAI-1 through a TNF-α-dependent mechanism. We exposed wild-type and IL-6<sup>−/−</sup> mice to concentrated ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> (CAPs) or filtered air (FA) 8 hours per day for three days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Sioutas1">[16]</xref>. The mean daily ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration was 12.7±3.1 µg/m<sup>3</sup> during the study period while the mean concentration in the PM exposure chamber was 88.5±13.4 µg/m<sup>3</sup>. In mice exposed to CAPs, we found small but significant elevations in the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, MCP-1 and TNF-α in the BAL fluid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018525-g001">Figure 1A–C</xref>). PAI-1 is the major systemic inhibitor of fibrinolysis and the white adipose tissue is a major site of PAI-1 production, particularly in response to inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Renckens1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Samad1">[18]</xref>. We exposed mice to CAPs 8 hours daily for three days and measured the levels of PAI-1 mRNA in the white adipose tissue. Compared with mice concomitantly exposed to filtered air, the CAPs exposed mice had a significant increase in white adipose tissue PAI-1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018525-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). This increase in PAI-1 was similar in both wild-type and IL-6<sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018525-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Canonical signaling through the TNF-α receptor activates the transcription factor NF-κB, which is a strong regulator of the PAI-1 promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Rothwarf1">[19]</xref>. To test the hypothesis that the increase in PAI-1 transcription observed in CAPs exposed mice is regulated by TNF-α, we treated mice with the TNF-α inhibitor, etanercept (10 mg/kg, 3 days before and on the first day of exposure to CAPs). The administration of etanercept prevented the increase in white-adipose tissue PAI-1 mRNA in mice exposed to CAPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018525-g001">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>

          <p>Wild-type (IL-6<sup>+/+</sup>) and IL-6<sup>−/−</sup> mice were exposed contemporaneously to CAPs (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) or filtered air (FA) for 8 hours daily on 3 consecutive days and BAL fluid was harvested at the end of the third day of exposure for measurement of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) (<bold>A</bold>), Monocyte Chemotactic Protein-1 (MCP-1) (<bold>B</bold>) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α) (<bold>C</bold>). White adipose tissue was harvested from identically treated mice for measurement of the levels of PAI-1 mRNA (<bold>D</bold>). Wild type mice were treated with etanercept (10 mg/kg i.p.) or vehicle (saline) 3 days before and on the first day of exposure to CAPs or FA and white adipose tissue levels of PAI-1 mRNA were measured after the third day of exposure (<bold>E</bold>).

      <p>Exposure to CAPs or instilled urban PM causes the IL-6-dependent activation of coagulation. Twenty-four hours after the intratracheal instillation of coarse PM, we reported that mice develop a prothrombotic state, which requires the release of IL-6 from alveolar macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Mutlu2">[14]</xref>. We sought to determine whether this pathway is activated upon inhalation of PM<sub>2.5</sub>. We measured mRNA levels of IL-6 and its transcriptional targets surfactant protein B and tissue factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Yan1">[20]</xref> in lung homogenates collected from mice exposed to CAPs or filtered air for 8 hours daily on three consecutive days. In wild-type mice, exposure to PM was associated with an increase in the transcription of IL-6, surfactant protein B (SFPB) and tissue factor (TF), while the levels of these transcripts did not increase in contemporaneously exposed IL-6<sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018525-g002">Figure 2A–C</xref>). Similarly, we found a significant increases in the levels of thrombin antithrombin complexes (TAT) in the plasma of wild-type but not IL-6<sup>−/−</sup> mice exposed to CAPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018525-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We found that PM-induced inflammation is sufficient to induce a prothrombotic state and impair fibrinolysis in mice. Distinct mechanisms underlie the activation of coagulation and the inhibition of fibrinolysis as the activation of coagulation required the generation of IL-6, whereas the increase in PAI-1 required signaling through TNF-α independent of IL-6. In a standard and physiologically relevant inhalational model of PM exposure, we found evidence of IL-6-mediated gene transcription in the lung and the development of an IL-6-dependent prothrombotic state. In the same model, the administration of an inhibitor antibody against TNF-α prevented the systemic increase in PAI-1. The inhalation of PM was sufficient to increase expression of tissue factor, a transcriptional target of IL-6, and the intratracheal administration of PM was sufficient to induce the IL-6 dependent intrapulmonary deposition of fibrin.</p>
      <p>Healthy people and people with pre-existing coronary artery disease exhibit a reduction in plasma tissue plasminogen activator in the first 24 hours after exposure to PM, suggesting that PM exposure might impair fibrinolysis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Graff1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Mills1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Mills2">[26]</xref>. Fibrinolysis describes the degradation of fibrin by plasmin resulting in the generation of fibrin degradation products. Two fibrinolytic enzymes, urokinase-type plasminogen activator and tissue-type plasminogen activator are primarily responsible for the activation of plasmin from plasminogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Renckens1">[17]</xref>. Both of these enzymes are inhibited by PAI-1. Elevated levels of circulating PAI-1 have been identified as an independent risk factor for the development of ischemic cardiovascular events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Meade1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Thogersen1">[28]</xref> and have been associated with obesity, insulin resistance, aging, stress, inflammation and atherosclerosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Cesari1">[29]</xref>. We found that exposure to PM increases PAI-1 levels in the lung and in the white adipose tissue, the major source of circulating PAI-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Samad1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Mertens1">[30]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The PAI-I promoter contains several functional binding sites for NF-κB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Hou1">[31]</xref>, which is strongly activated by TNF-α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Rothwarf1">[19]</xref> but lacks binding sites for STAT3, the primary transcription factor activated by IL-6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Plomgaard1">[32]</xref>. Consistent with these observations, we observed a similar PM-induced increase in PAI-1 in IL-6<sup>−/−</sup> and wild-type animals. Etanercept is a fusion protein combining the human TNF receptor 2 with human IgG and has been shown to inhibit murine as well as human TNF-α signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-VenegasPont1">[33]</xref>. The administration of etanercept prior to PM exposure prevented the increase in PAI-1 transcription in the white adipose tissue and the increase in BAL PAI-1 induced by PM. Our results suggest that the inhibition of fibrinolysis is not required for the PM-induced tendency toward developing thrombosis as treatment with etanercept did not prevent the PM-induced reduction in PT, PTT or bleeding time or the increase in plasma TAT. While an increase in PAI-1 is often presented as evidence of inhibited fibrinolysis, we did not directly assess the blood or tissue fibrinolytic activity after PM exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Cesari1">[29]</xref>.</p>
      <p>While our data do not address the source of TNF-α required for the induction of PAI-1 expression in the white adipose tissue, we previously reported that the intratracheal instillation of coarse PM was associated with only very small increases in the plasma levels of TNF-α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Mutlu2">[14]</xref>. Even this low level of TNF-α signaling, if sustained, may be sufficient to stimulate the production of PAI-1 by adipocytes. Alternatively, some particles may gain access to the circulation and induce a local inflammatory response in or near the adipose tissue.</p>
      <p>The risk of ischemic cardiovascular events in humans increases with increasing exposure to PM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Peters1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-DIppoliti1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Dockery1">[36]</xref>. While the mechanisms by which PM increases acute cardiovascular events are not fully understood, we and others have suggested that the consequences of PM-induced lung inflammation on hemostasis play an important role in this response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Brook1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Ghio1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Bonzini1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Ruckerl2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Mutlu2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Mills1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Baccarelli1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Nemmar1">[38]</xref>. Exposure of humans to PM has been associated with increases in fibrinogen levels, shortening of the prothrombin time and the development of arterial (ischemic cardiovascular events) and venous (venous thromboembolism) thrombosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Brook1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Ghio2">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Baccarelli1">[37]</xref>. We previously reported that the intratracheal administration of coarse PM from Dusseldorf, Germany caused a transient prothrombotic state, which required the release of IL-6 from alveolar macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Mutlu2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Nemmar1">[38]</xref>. Our current results extend these findings; we found that a fine PM fraction collected from Washington DC administered intratracheally and the inhalation of CAPs were both sufficient to cause an IL-6-dependent prothrombotic state.</p>
      <p>Investigators have observed increases in both IL-6 and its transcriptional target C-reactive protein (expressed in humans but not mice) in humans following PM exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Ruckerl1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Ruckerl2">[11]</xref>. Our results highlight the importance of IL-6 in the development of the PM-induced prothrombotic state independent of other markers of inflammation. Following the intratracheal administration of PM, we found that the severity of the inflammatory response as measured by BAL fluid cell count, BAL fluid protein and histology were similar in wild-type and IL-6<sup>−/−</sup> mice, however, the increase in TAT was not observed in the IL-6<sup>−/−</sup> animals. In mice exposed to CAPs for 8 hours daily on 3 consecutive days, the increase in IL-6 was small but was still sufficient to increase transcription of the IL-6 target genes surfactant protein B and tissue factor and increase the plasma levels of TAT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Yan1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Kerr1">[39]</xref>. The unique role of IL-6 in promoting thrombosis is well-described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Kerr1">[39]</xref>. One mechanism, supported by our current results, is the transcriptional upregulation of tissue factor expression. Other important mechanisms include increased hepatic synthesis of the pro-coagulant factors fibrinogen, Factor VIII and vWF and reduced transcription of inhibitors of thrombosis including Protein C and Antithrombin. We previously reported that PM-treated animals exhibited selective, IL-6 dependent increases in fibrinogen, FVIII and vWF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Mutlu2">[14]</xref>. Investigators have not reported similar changes in coagulation in response to elevations in other pro-inflammatory cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Kerr1">[39]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We observed an IL-6-dependent increase in whole lung mRNA encoding tissue factor following exposure to CAPs and after the instillation of PM. We were only able to detect tissue factor protein in the lung and increased levels of fibrin after the instillation of relatively high doses of PM. While this may reflect the limited sensitivity of the available assays to detect the differential expression of these proteins in the lung, we cannot exclude the possibility that the increase in lung tissue factor results from the modest PM-induced lung injury that we have observed in the lungs of animals following PM exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Mutlu1">[7]</xref>. Our results are in agreement with those of Sun et al who observed an increase in TF expression in atherosclerotic plaques in a murine model of atherosclerosis after chronic exposure to CAPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Sun1">[40]</xref>. Interestingly, increased levels of PAI-1 have been observed in atherosclerotic lesions and may be contribute to the development or progression of the disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018525-Diebold1">[41]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We conclude that the lung inflammation induced by the inhalation of PM<sub>2.5</sub> is sufficient to activate coagulation and inhibit fibrinolysis in the lung and systemically. PM induced IL-6 generation was required for the increased in tissue factor and fibrin in the lung and the systemic increase in TAT levels. By contrast, PM-induced TNF-α generation was required for the observed increase in PAI-1 but did not contribute to the PM-induced reduction in PT, PTT or bleeding time. Both mechanisms provide a link between exposure to PM and the observed increase in ischemic cardiovascular events in human populations.</p>

        <p>A549 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with L-glutamine (0.3 µg/ml), nonessential amino acids, penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (200 µg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY). For each experiment, we used a seeding density of 3.0×10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml/well plated onto six-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA). The cells were grown to confluence over 24 h in a humidified 95% air/5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37°C.</p>
