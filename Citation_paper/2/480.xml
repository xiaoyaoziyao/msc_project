      <abstract>
        <p>The Rehai and Ruidian geothermal fields, located in Tengchong County, Yunnan Province, China, host a variety of geochemically distinct hot springs. In this study, we report a comprehensive, cultivation-independent census of microbial communities in 37 samples collected from these geothermal fields, encompassing sites ranging in temperature from 55.1 to 93.6°C, in pH from 2.5 to 9.4, and in mineralogy from silicates in Rehai to carbonates in Ruidian. Richness was low in all samples, with 21–123 species-level OTUs detected. The bacterial phylum <italic>Aquificae</italic> or archaeal phylum <italic>Crenarchaeota</italic> were dominant in Rehai samples, yet the dominant taxa within those phyla depended on temperature, pH, and geochemistry. Rehai springs with low pH (2.5–2.6), high temperature (85.1–89.1°C), and high sulfur contents favored the crenarchaeal order <italic>Sulfolobales,</italic> whereas those with low pH (2.6–4.8) and cooler temperature (55.1–64.5°C) favored the <italic>Aquificae</italic> genus <italic>Hydrogenobaculum</italic>. Rehai springs with neutral-alkaline pH (7.2–9.4) and high temperature (&gt;80°C) with high concentrations of silica and salt ions (Na, K, and Cl) favored the <italic>Aquificae</italic> genus <italic>Hydrogenobacter</italic> and crenarchaeal orders <italic>Desulfurococcales</italic> and <italic>Thermoproteales</italic>. <italic>Desulfurococcales</italic> and <italic>Thermoproteales</italic> became predominant in springs with pH much higher than the optimum and even the maximum pH known for these orders. Ruidian water samples harbored a single <italic>Aquificae</italic> genus <italic>Hydrogenobacter</italic>, whereas microbial communities in Ruidian sediment samples were more diverse at the phylum level and distinctly different from those in Rehai and Ruidian water samples, with a higher abundance of uncultivated lineages, close relatives of the ammonia-oxidizing archaeon “<italic>Candidatus</italic> Nitrosocaldus yellowstonii”, and candidate division O1aA90 and OP1. These differences between Ruidian sediments and Rehai samples were likely caused by temperature, pH, and sediment mineralogy. The results of this study significantly expand the current understanding of the microbiology in Tengchong hot springs and provide a basis for comparison with other geothermal systems around the world.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Tengchong County, located in Yunnan Province, Southwestern China, is known for its geothermal features <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Liao1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Wang1">[3]</xref>. Tectonically, Tengchong is located at the collision boundary between the India and Eurasia plates. Subduction of oceanic crust leads to extensive volcanism. The hot springs of Tengchong are a result of such volcanism with more than 50 volcanoes and 140 geothermal areas throughout the county <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Du1">[4]</xref>. In terms of the diversity and scale, the Tengchong springs are comparable to the geothermal systems in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Fournier1">[5]</xref>, Japan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Yoshida1">[6]</xref>, and Kamchatka, Russia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Kyle1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The Rehai (“Hot Sea”) and Ruidian geothermal fields in Tengchong are two regions of intense hydrothermal activity with numerous springs and pools. Physicochemical conditions span a wide range of temperature (58 to ∼97°C) and pH (&lt;1.8 to ≥9.3) and these conditions provide numerous niches to support phylogenetically and functionally distinct microbial communities. Therefore, the Tengchong geothermal fields likely represent a biodiversity hotspot for thermophiles and provide an opportunity to compare microbial diversity and community structure with other geothermal areas around the world. Past studies in this area have focused on cultivation, physiology, and biotechnological applications of thermophilic microorganisms (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Hedlund1">[8]</xref>). Overall, these studies revealed that acidic springs harbor thermoacidophilic bacteria and archaea, particularly <italic>Sulfolobales</italic>, which can grow chemolithotrophically by oxidizing sulfide, sulfur, thiosulfate and ferrous iron. Likewise, alkaline springs harbor many alkaliphilic bacteria, particularly <italic>Firmicutes</italic> and <italic>Thermales</italic>, which grow chemoorganotrophically on a number of organic substrates.</p>
      <p>Whereas cultivation-dependent studies are valuable for isolating novel organisms and exploring their properties, the cultivation-independent methods offer a more comprehensive assessment of microbial diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Tringe1">[9]</xref>. In Tengchong, however, only a few molecular-based studies have been reported. Specifically, three orders of <italic>Crenarchaeota</italic> (<italic>Sulfolobales, Desulfurococcales</italic>, and <italic>Thermoproteales</italic>) were found in Tengchong springs and crenarchaeotal diversity was correlated with temperature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Song1">[10]</xref>. Microbial diversity in two hot spring microbial mats from Tengchong was recently described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Pagaling1">[11]</xref>. Other cultivation-independent studies have focused on ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Pearson1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Jiang1">[14]</xref> and these studies suggest that AOA may be a minor but potentially active component of the microbial community in several Tengchong springs.</p>
      <p>Despite these previous efforts, a comprehensive census of the microbial communities in Tengchong hot springs is still lacking. The primary objective of this study was to census a large number of high temperature springs in Tengchong and to investigate the relationships between thermophilic microbial communities and physicochemical conditions. To achieve this objective, a coordinated geochemical and molecular survey was conducted for 16 Tengchong hot springs and the relationships among microbial diversity, community structure, and geochemistry were explored. The results of this study expand the current understanding of the microbiology in Tengchong hot springs and provide a basis for comparison with other geothermal systems around the world.</p>

        <p>No specific permits were required for the described field studies because no animal or human subjects were involved in this research. The sampling locations are not privately owned or protected in any way. The field studies did not involve endangered or protected species.</p>
        <p>Field measurements and sample collections were conducted in January 2011. Water temperature, pH, conductivity (portable meters; LaMotte, MD, USA) and the spring size were measured for more than 20 springs. Sixteen springs were chosen for further study, including 14 from Rehai and 2 from Ruidian (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053350-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053350.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Concentrations of ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), total sulfide (ΣS<sup>2−</sup>), ferrous iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>), nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>) and nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>) were measured with spectrophotometry using Hach test kits (Hach Chemical Co., IA, USA) after filtering spring water through 0.20 µm polyethersulfone (PES) membrane filters (Pall Corp., NY).</p>

            <p>The open symbols represent the geochemistry and the closed symbols represent the microbial communities. The circles represent the water and the squares represent the sediment geochemistry. The colors of each symbol represent the grouping of either microbial communities (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053350-g002">Figure 2</xref>) or water and sediment geochemistry (from <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053350.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053350.s003">S3</xref> for water and sediment/sinter, respectively) based on hierarchical clustering. The microbial community, sediment geochemistry, and water geochemistry were analyzed separately and color comparisons across different symbols cannot be made; however, a similar color within one symbol (for example solid circle) depicts microbial community or geochemical similarities across the sampling sites. XRD mineralogical analysis of the sediment geochemistry at Dagunguo (Dgg) failed. Huitaijing (Htj) did not have any sediment. There were no microbial data for the Zhenzhuquan (Zzq) sediments because of PCR failure. Abbreviations are Jimeiquan (Jmq), Zhenzhuquan (Zzq), Guminquan (Gmq), Huitaijing (Htj), Jinze (Jz), Diretiyanqu (Drty), Gongxiaoshe (Gxs), Shuirebaozhaqu (Srbz), and Dagunguo (Dgg).</p>

        <title>Sample Collection</title>
        <p>Sixteen water samples, 1 microbial streamer, 13 sediment samples, and 6 sinter samples from 16 springs were collected for geochemical and microbiological analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053350-t001">Table 1</xref>). Depending on the site, 50–360 mL of spring waters were filtered through a syringe filter (0.22 µm pore size, 25 mm diameter, Millipore, USA) to collect biomass. In one spring (Dagunguo), biomass was also collected via tangential flow filtration (TFF) that concentrated 200 L of water to 2 L using a 30 kDa MWCO prep/scale TFF-6 filter (Millipore, USA) followed by centrifugation at 12000×g (4°C, 20 min.) after four days of storage in the lab at 4°C.</p>

        <p>Water samples were collected for the measurements of hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition and concentrations of cation, anion, trace elements, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and total nitrogen (TN). Water samples for hydrogen and oxygen isotope measurements were filtered through 0.22 µm polyethersulfone (PES) filters (25 mm diameter; Pall Corp., USA) and collected into 25-mL glass bottles. Water samples were collected to determine concentrations of major cations, anions, and trace elements by filtering 25 mL of water through 0.22 µm PES filters into 60-mL high density polyethylene (HDPE), acid-washed Nalgene® bottles. High-purity nitric acid (2%, V/V) was added to stabilize the trace element samples. Water samples for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total nitrogen (TN) measurements were filtered through the same 0.22 µm PES filters. The DOC/TN samples were stored in acid-washed and rinsed 125 mL fluorinated high-density polyethylene bottles that were pre-acidified with 0.2% (V/V) HCl.</p>
        <p>Sediment samples were collected with sterile spatulas and spoons, and homogenized in a pre-sterilized aluminum pan. In springs with little dispersed sediment, fragments of sinter were collected using a sterilized hammer and chisel. Multiple aliquots of sediment or crushed sinter material were placed into 1.5 mL or 50 mL polypropylene tubes. All samples for microbial analysis were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen or dry ice, stored on dry ice during transportation and at −80°C in the laboratory. Sediment samples for geochemical analyses were stored on ice until analysis.</p>

        <title>Statistical Analysis of Geochemical and Microbial Data</title>
        <p>To identify geochemical parameters that contributed most to microbial variability, seventy-nine water geochemical variables (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053350.s009">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053350.s010">S2</xref> minus the mineralogical data) were first subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) with the ‘vegan’ package in the R programming environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Oksanen1">[30]</xref>. Co-correlated geochemical variables were removed, and the remaining 17 variables were rank-ordered based on their correlations to the first three axes. For the sediment geochemistry, all 18 mineralogical variables (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053350.s009">Table S1</xref>) were used. Seventeen water geochemical variables were subjected to hierarchical clustering of Log<sub>10</sub> geochemical values with linkage by the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) of Euclidean distances to identify groups of sites with similar water geochemistry. Eighteen sediment geochemical variables were subjected to similar clustering analysis but without logarithmic transformation of the values because all values were between 0 and 1.</p>
        <p>Chao1 (predicted number of OTUs), Shannon, and equitability indices, based on 16S rRNA gene sequence data, were calculated at the 97% cutoff level after removing four samples with fewer than 978 reads and normalizing all remaining libraries to the one with the smallest number of reads (978 reads). These diversity indices were tested for their correlation with the geochemical data using Mantel test.</p>
        <p>Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) was performed, based on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity at the 97% similarity level, to test for any significant dissimilarity or similarity in community composition among certain groups of springs defined <italic>a priori</italic>. The groups were pre-defined based on water and sediment geochemistry. The test was performed in three steps: First, only one factor, e.g., geothermal field (Rehai vs. Ruidian) and sample type (water vs. sediment) was considered individually. Second, geothermal field and sample type were considered together, forming four groups: Rehai water, Rehai sediment, Ruidian water, and Ruidian sediment. Third, because of the large pH range (2.5–9.4) in the Rehai hot springs, the pH factor (low: 2.5–4.8 and high: 6.7–9.4) was added, forming six groups, including Rehai low-pH water, Rehai low-pH sediment, Rehai high-pH water, Rehai high-pH sediment, Ruidian high-pH water, and Ruidian high-pH sediment. There was no low-pH water or sediment in Ruidian. Pairwise comparisons were carried out in ANOSIM and pairwise p- and r values were obtained as a way to assess any significant difference in community composition between any two of the above groups.</p>
        <p>Jackknifed UPGMA clustering was performed to compare microbial community similarity among the samples based on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity at the 97% similarity OTU level. For certain representative groups that were identified by ANOSIM and the UPGMA clustering, SIMPER (similarity percentage) analysis was performed to rank the top ten OTUs that contributed to the observed similarity (or dissimilarity) among two groups. The average abundances of these OTUs in each group were then calculated.</p>
        <p>The BIO-ENV procedure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Clarke1">[31]</xref> was used to identify the best subset of environmental variables to reveal correlations between community data (Bray?Curtis dissimilarity) and scaled environmental data (Euclidean distance) using identified 17 water and 18 sediment geochemical variables. Mantel tests were further performed to confirm correlation between the community structure and selected geochemical variables.</p>
        <p>To identify differences between the two primer sets, ANOSIM, non-parametric multivariate ANOVA (Adonis), and multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP) were performed based on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity distance matrices. Other than geochemical clustering analyses, all statistical analyses were done in QIIME pipeline and/or using the package “vegan” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Oksanen1">[30]</xref> in the R programming environment.</p>

        <title>Physical and Chemical Characteristics of Tengchong Hot Springs</title>
        <p>Tengchong hot springs exhibited a wide range of physical and chemical conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053350-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053350.s001">Figure S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053350.s009">Table S1</xref> &amp; S2) with great variations in dimension and sediment and sinter mineralogy. Visually, there were three major types of springs: 1) large pools with standing water (expected long residence time); 2) high discharge, fast flowing springs with small source pools (expected short residence time); and 3) small, shallow acidic pools. Large source pools included Dagunguo (Dgg), Gongxiaoshe (Gxs), and Jinze (Jz) springs. Small, high discharge springs included Jiemeiquan (Jmq) and Gumingquan (Gmq). Shallow acidic pools included the spring Zhenzhuquan (Zzq) which exhibited strong outgassing, and a series of pools at Diretiyanqu (Drty). In addition, other types of springs were also present. For example, Huitaijing (Htj) was comprised of two small open wells, with cobble bottoms and relatively low discharge; Shuirebaozha (Srbz) was a shallow spring with a variety of geothermal sources.</p>
        <p>Hierarchical clustering divided the spring water chemistry into three well-defined groups based on geographical location (distance) and pH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053350.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The neutral-alkaline springs in Rehai (W3) have been previously categorized as Na-Cl-HCO<sub>3</sub> or Na-HCO<sub>3</sub>-Cl or springs that directly discharge from a high temperature subterranean reservoir within granite or granitic clastic sedimentary host rocks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Zhang2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Zhang3">[33]</xref>. In contrast, those in Ruidian (W1) have been categorized as Na-HCO<sub>3</sub> springs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Zhang2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Zhang3">[33]</xref> and were characterized by high Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053350.s009">Table S1</xref>), likely caused by dissolution of carbonates. The four acidic sites in Rehai (W2), Zhenzhuquan and Diretiyanqu-1, -2, and -3, exhibited elevated levels of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, DOC, and TN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053350.s009">Tables S1</xref> &amp; S2). These data suggest that these acidic springs likely represent vapor condensate-dominated systems that are acidified by oxidation of sulfide to sulfuric acid. The hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053350.s003">Figure S3</xref>) were plotted along the local meteoric water line, suggesting that meteoric water was the main source for all springs, as has been previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Shen1">[34]</xref>. A large spread in δ<sup>2</sup>H and δ<sup>18</sup>O values for Rehai springs suggest that there were different extents of evaporation, consistent with their different temperatures and varying ratios of surface area/volume. The δ<sup>2</sup>H and δ<sup>18</sup>O values for Ruidian springs were more negative than those for Rehai springs, suggesting Ruidian springs underwent less evaporation, likely due to their moderate temperatures and low ratios of surface area/volume.</p>
        <p>Hierarchical clustering of the sediment geochemistry revealed two broad clusters (referred to as S1 and S2) that corresponded to the two geothermal fields (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053350.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Springs in Ruidian were distinct from those in Rehai in terms of both TOC/TN (51.4% cumulative contribution) and mineralogy (48.6% cumulative contribution). TOC content in the Ruidian spring sediments was generally higher than in the Rehai sediments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053350.s009">Table S1</xref>). Silicate minerals dominated the Rehai spring sediments, whereas carbonates (aragonite and calcite) were main minerals in the Ruidian sediments. The solid-phase and aqueous geochemistry of the springs was generally consistent with a granite-hosted system in Rehai and a carbonate-hosted system in Ruidian.</p>

        <title>Microbial Diversity</title>
        <p>The two primer sets did not result in any significant differences in microbial diversity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053350.s005">Figure S5</xref>) and structure (Figures S6 and S7, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053350.s011">Table S3</xref>). However, more archaeal sequences were retrieved by the modified primer set than by the original primer set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053350.s012">Table S4</xref>). For this reason, the modified primer pair was used for all the samples. A total of 345,802 reads were obtained for 37 samples with the modified primer set after removal of low-quality and chimeric sequences. A variety of taxa were observed at the 97% OTU level, with 21–123 observed and 50–223 predicted OTUs (based on Chao1) and coverage values ranging from 38.2% to 69.9% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053350-t002">Table 2</xref>). In Rehai, richness, Shannon diversity, and equitability were not significantly different between sediments and water communities except for Dagunguo, where these indices were higher for sediment samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053350-t002">Table 2</xref>). Similar to Dagunguo, microbial community diversity and richness were much higher in Ruidian sediments than in waters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053350-t002">Table 2</xref>). Richness was slightly higher in neutral-alkaline springs than in acidic springs, but Shannon diversity and equitability showed no significant correlation with temperature and pH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053350.s008">Figure S8</xref>), or any other selected geochemical variables, which was also confirmed by Mantel tests with all p&gt;0.1. Microbial richness, equitability, and Shannon diversity in Ruidian sinters and sediments were markedly higher than in Rehai sediments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053350-t002">Table 2</xref>), and this difference was related to TOC content in sediments/sinters (Chao1 and TOC: r  = 0.42, p&lt;0.05; Shannon diversity and TOC: r  = 0.30, p&lt;0.1).</p>

        <title>Overall Microbial Community Structure in Relation to Geochemistry</title>
        <p>The results of pairwise comparisons using ANOSIM suggested that there was no significant difference in microbial community structure either between Rehai and Ruidian springs or between water and sediment, with the R-statistic value of 0.16 and 0.02, respectively, and p&gt;0.05 for both comparisons. When the geothermal field and the sample type were considered together, the test results showed that microbial community structure in Ruidian sediment was distinctly different from those of the other three groups: Ruidian water, Rehai water, and Rehai sediment with the R-statistic value of 0.71, 0.28, and 0.41, respectively and p&lt;0.05 (for all 3 comparisons). Addition of the pH factor in the analysis further divided the Rehai samples to two distinct groups: low (2.5–4.8) and high (6.7–9.4) pH springs (all R-statistic values near 1 and p&lt;0.01); and Ruidian water samples were similar to Rehai high pH samples in microbial composition. In summary, three distinct groups were identified based on ANOSIM: 1) Ruidian sediment; 2) Rehai low pH, and 3) Rehai high pH samples (both sediment and water) and Ruidian water samples.</p>
        <p>A similar grouping pattern was also identified based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity at the 97% similarity OTU level using a UPGMA cluster tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053350-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Four groups were identified that could be differentiated based on the various combinations of the geothermal field, pH, and temperature (T). The four groups were: Group 1: high T and neutral to alkaline pH (namely Rehai high pH water+sediment and Ruidian water samples); Group 2: moderate T and neutral pH (Ruidian sediments); Group 3: low T and low pH (Rehai); and Group 4: high T and low pH (Rehai). These groups were similar to those identified by the ANOSIM analysis. Mantel tests revealed that community structure was significantly correlated with pH and temperature (r = 0.47 and 0.44, respectively; p  = 0.001). The BIO-ENV results confirmed that community structure was significantly correlated with a combination of pH and temperature (r  = 0.73).</p>

Filled circles at nodes represent jackknife values. “TFF”, “Sin”, “Sed”, “Str” and “W” in sample ID refer to the tangential flow filtration (TFF) sample (only from Dagunguo), sinter, sediment, streamer and water samples, respectively. The numbers in the site name are the pH and temperature of each site. The prefix “Bac” denotes bacterial phyla, and the prefix “Arch” denotes archaeal phyla. Only the microbial groups with abundance higher than 2% are displayed. The groups with abundances lower than 2% are included as “Others”.</p>

        <p>To reveal associations between microbial composition and geochemistry, geochemical groups were plotted along with the four microbial groups for a direct visual comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053350-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In general, microbial community structure broadly corresponded to water and sediment geochemistry but with some exceptions. For example, Jiemeiquan, Gumingquan, Huitaijing, Shuirebaozha, and Dagunguo exhibited similar aqueous geochemistry and similar water-borne microbial communities. Likewise, Shuirebaozha, Gumingquan, and Jiemeiquan exhibited similar sediment geochemistry and similar benthic microbial composition, suggesting that sediment geochemistry is important in shaping microbial community structure in sediment. However, in some cases, geochemistry and microbial community structure did not correspond to each other. For example, despite having similar sediment geochemistry to Jiemeiquan, Gumingquan, and Shuirebaozha, the acidic hot springs in Rehai (Drty-1, -2, and -3) had a different benthic community.</p>

        <p>Average archaeal abundance was much higher in Rehai springs (31±35%) than in Ruidian springs (9±10%). In some high temperature acidic (i.e., Diretiyanqu-1 and Zhenzhuquan) and alkaline (Gumingquan and Huitaijing) springs in Rehai, more than 90% of total sequences in the pyrotag dataset was composed of archaea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053350-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053350-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). To reveal differences in specific taxonomic groups between Rehai and Ruidian as well as among the springs of a given region, SIMPER analysis was used to identify the top ten taxonomic groups that contributed to the dissimilarities or similarities among the selected groups of hot springs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053350-t003">Table 3</xref>). At the regional scale, there were differences at the family/genus level between Rehai and Ruidian (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053350-t003">Table 3</xref>, 1<sup>st</sup> comparison), <italic>Hydrogenobacter</italic> was present in both Rehai and Ruidian, but its relative abundance was higher in Rehai. <italic>Sulfolobus, Desulfurococcaceae, Hydrogenobaculum, Pyrobaculum,</italic> and <italic>Thermodesulfobacteriaceae</italic> were present in Rehai, but not in Ruidian. Likewise, unclassified bacteria, candidate phylum O1aA90 and OP1, <italic>Thermaceae</italic>, and <italic>Rhodothermaceae</italic> were significantly more abundant in Ruidian. Several of the thermoacidophilic taxa were present only in Rehai because of the presence of acidic springs; therefore, acidic springs were removed from the analysis and the comparison between Rehai and Ruidian was repeated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053350-t003">Table 3</xref>, 2<sup>nd</sup> comparison). This revealed that <italic>Hydrogenobacter</italic>, <italic>Desulfurococcaceae</italic>, <italic>Pyrobaculum</italic>, and <italic>Thermodesulfobacteriaceae</italic> were more abundant in Rehai, whereas <italic>Thermus</italic>, yet-uncultivated groups O1aA90, <italic>Thermaceae</italic>, <italic>Rhodothermaceae</italic>, and a yet-unnamed novel bacterial group were more abundant in Ruidian.</p>

        <p>Within Rehai, the bacterial phylum <italic>Aquificae</italic> and the archaeal phylum <italic>Crenarchaeota</italic> (primarily class <italic>Thermoprotei</italic>) were the predominant groups, comprising 72±26% and 92±23% of total bacteria and archaea, respectively (as opposed to 35±41% and 55±46%, respectively within Ruidian). The percentage of <italic>Aquificae</italic> in water samples (71.1% ±31.6%) was higher than in sediments or sinters (33.7% ±28.9%). In addition, the microbial composition within <italic>Aquificae</italic> and <italic>Thermoprotei</italic> varied according to environmental conditions. Within the <italic>Aquificae</italic>, <italic>Hydrogenobacter</italic> was abundant in springs with circumneutral to alkaline pH (6.7–9.4, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053350-t003">Table 3</xref>, 3<sup>rd</sup> comparison and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053350-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), whereas <italic>Hydrogenobaculum</italic> was the dominant <italic>Aquificae</italic> genus in low temperature, acidic, and sulfur-rich springs (T: 55.1–64.5°C, pH: 2.5–2.6; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053350-t003">Table 3</xref>, 4<sup>th</sup> comparison and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053350-g003">Figure 3B</xref>); however, it was not present in high temperature acidic sites (T: 85.1–89.1°C and pH: 2.6–4.8). Similarly, the three orders of <italic>Thermoprotei, Sulfolobales, Desulfurococcales</italic> and <italic>Thermoproteales</italic>, showed distinctive distribution patterns. <italic>Sulfolobales</italic>, predominantly the genus <italic>Sulfolobus</italic>, was dominant in high temperature, acidic, and sulfur-rich springs (T: 85.1–89.1°C and pH: 2.5–4.8), comprising &gt;82% of all sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053350-t003">Table 3</xref>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> comparisons; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053350-g002">Figures 2B</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053350-g003">3C</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Desulfurococcales</italic> and <italic>Thermoproteales</italic> (mainly <italic>Pyrobaculum</italic>) were the dominant archaea in springs with circumneutral to alkaline pH (pH: 6.7–9.4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053350-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) and high concentrations of silica, Na, K and Cl (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053350-t001">Table 1</xref>). Within acidic sites, temperature exerted a strong control on community composition. With decreased temperature, a <italic>Sulfolobus</italic>-dominated community gave way to a more diverse community with a relatively high abundance of the bacterial taxa <italic>Hydrogenobaculum</italic>, <italic>Acidisphaera</italic>, and <italic>Desulfurella</italic>, and the archaeal taxon <italic>Metallosphaera</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053350-t003">Table 3</xref>, 4<sup>th</sup> comparison). The relative abundance of <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> increased linearly with increased temperature in the acidic samples (Pearson correlation = 0.97, p = 0.002).</p>
        <p>Some bacterial and archaeal groups were abundant only in specific samples. For example, <italic>Thermaceae</italic> (<italic>Deinococcus-Thermus</italic> phylum) and <italic>Rhodothermaceae</italic> (<italic>Bacteriodetes</italic> phylum) were fairly abundant only in samples from Gongxiaoshe in Ruidian. <italic>Thermodesulfobacteriaceae</italic> were prominent in several Rehai springs with high temperature (78.2–93.6°C) and neutral-alkaline pH (7.2–9.4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053350-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053350-t003">Table 3</xref>). Putative ammonia-oxidizing archaea in the <italic>Thaumarchaeota</italic> (mainly related to “<italic>Candidatus</italic> Nitrosocaldus”) were the dominant archaea in Gongxiaoshe spring (74% of total archaea, which was ∼10% of total sequences in the dataset), whereas the order <italic>Thermoplasmatales</italic> in the <italic>Euryarchaeota</italic> were the predominant archaea in the lowest temperature acidic site, Diretiyanqu 3.</p>

        <p>Markedly higher microbial richness, equitability, and diversity in Ruidian sinters and sediments than in sediments and waters from Rehai (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053350-t002">Table 2</xref>) may be due to the circumneutral pH, moderate temperatures, and high TOC contents of the Ruidian springs relative to those from Rehai (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053350-t001">Table 1</xref>). Different mineralogy between Ruidian and Rehai sediments/sinters (carbonates vs. silicates) may have contributed to the difference in microbial diversity between these two hydrothermal fields as well. However, because of the similarly low diversity in both Ruidian and Rehai waters, it is likely that sediment properties (i.e., high TOC, carbonate mineralogy) may be more important in accounting for the high diversity in Ruidian sediments and sinters. A previous study also revealed a much higher microbial diversity in sediment than in water of Great Boiling Spring in Nevada, which may be related to long water residence time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Dodsworth1">[20]</xref>. Ruidian springs were expected to have long resident time and may have accounted for the large difference in diversity between the sediment and water.</p>

        <title>Comparison with Previous Studies in Tengchong Hot Springs</title>
        <p>Previous studies of thermophiles from Tengchong springs have mostly focused on microbial cultivation studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Hedlund1">[8]</xref>. Our molecular examination of the springs detected many of the organisms previously isolated, but these taxa tended to be sub-dominant. For example, the bacterial genera <italic>Meiothermus</italic> and <italic>Thermus</italic> and the archaeal genera <italic>Acidianus</italic> and <italic>Metallosphaera</italic> have been previously isolated from Rehai springs and were detected, but not abundant in our study. Notably, our study revealed the dominance of <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> in high temperature, acidic, and high-sulfur springs in Rehai and a diversity of <italic>Sulfolobales</italic> isolates from Tengchong have been described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Xiang1">[35]</xref>. However, many microorganisms, such as <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, that have been isolated from Tengchong springs were not detected in this study. Although many of the dominant taxa in circumneutral and alkaline springs in Tengchong have close relatives in culture, few, if any, of those organisms have been isolated from Tengchong springs. This discrepancy is particularly clear among the <italic>Aquificae</italic> and the crenarchaeal orders <italic>Desulfurococcales</italic> and <italic>Thermoproteales</italic>.</p>
        <p>A comparison between the previous clone library-based studies and this study reveals consistency between the compositions of the community.

In contrast, sequences related to putative AOA were not detected in Rehai springs, despite their reported presence using a functional gene approach and the presence of lipid biomarkers (e.g., crenarchaeol) proposed to be diagnostic of AOA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Zhang1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Jiang1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Dodsworth2">[37]</xref>. This discrepancy is likely due to the lower temperatures of the springs previously sampled in Tengchong <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Zhang1">[13]</xref> and is consistent with the low <italic>amoA</italic> transcript levels detected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Jiang1">[14]</xref> in some of the spring that were also sampled in this study (i.e., Dagunguo, Diretiyanqu, Zhenzhuquan).

        <title>Microbial Community Composition in Tengchong in Comparison to other Geothermal Systems</title>
        <p>The composition of microbial communities in Tengchong appeared to be dependent on geothermal region, spring type, residence time, and geochemical conditions. For large source pools with standing water (Dagunguo, Gongxiaoshe, and Jinze), there were substantial differences in microbial community composition between water and sediment. The estimated long water residence times in these springs may allow a genuine planktonic community to develop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Dodsworth1">[20]</xref>. For small source pools with high discharge, there was no significant difference between water and sediment, likely because of their dynamic mixing.</p>
        <p>Microbial community composition and its correlation with geochemistry in Tengchong can be better understood by a comparison to other geothermal systems in the world. The hot spring systems of YNP and the Great Basin are well-studied examples for this purpose. In terms of mechanisms and genesis, the Tengchong hot springs are more similar to those in YNP in that they are both volcanically driven with acidic springs. In contrast, geothermal activity in the Great Basin is attributed to tectonically driven dilation of range-front faults and there are no highly acidic springs (e.g., pH &lt;5.5).</p>
        <p>Both Tengchong and YNP host springs with dramatically different geochemical conditions and both display a bi-modal pH distribution due to buffering by either the carbonate system or the sulfuric acid system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Brock1">[38]</xref>. As a result, many springs in Rehai and YNP harbor similar microbial communities at the phylum and family/genus levels. Among abundant microbial groups in Tengchong and YNP are the bacteria phyla <italic>Aquificae, Deinococcus-Thermus, Thermodesulfobacteria</italic>, and the archaeal phylum <italic>Crenarchaeota</italic>.</p>

          <title>Aquificae</title>
          <p>Four genera of <italic>Aquificales</italic>, <italic>Thermocrinis</italic>, <italic>Sulfurihydrogenibium</italic>, <italic>Hydrogenobacter</italic> and <italic>Hydrogenobaculum</italic>, are common in terrestrial geothermal environments and have been previously observed in YNP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Reysenbach1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-MeyerDombard2">[44]</xref>. All these genera were present in Tengchong springs; however, their relative abundance was somewhat surprising. <italic>Hydrogenobacter</italic> and <italic>Hydrogenobaculum</italic> were abundant in high temperature (73.8–93.6°C), circumneutral to alkaline pH (6.7–9.4) springs and low temperature (55.1–64.5°C), acidic (pH: 2.5–2.6), sulfur-rich springs, respectively; however, <italic>Thermocrinis</italic> and <italic>Sulfurihydrogenibium</italic> were apparently present at very low relative abundance (&lt;0.02% of all reads). <italic>Thermocrinis</italic> and <italic>Hydrogenobacter</italic> usually occupy similar niches in high temperature, circumneutral to alkaline (∼pH 8) terrestrial systems, although <italic>Hydrogenobacter</italic> may be more abundant at lower temperatures (60–80°C) than <italic>Thermocrinis</italic> (75–92°C) and is not known to form macroscopically visible streamers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Reysenbach1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Eder1">[45]</xref>. Given the high temperatures sampled here (&gt;78.2°C) and the abundance of streamer biomass in alkaline spring sources (pH &gt;8.3) in Rehai, it is surprising that <italic>Hydrogenobacter</italic> would dominate over <italic>Thermocrinis</italic>. However, a recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-MeyerDombard2">[44]</xref> has shown that <italic>Thermocrinis</italic>-dominated <italic>Aquificales</italic> are present in both streamer biofilm community (SBC) and non-SBC locations of YNP, and casted doubt on the hypotheses that <italic>Aquificales</italic> (especially <italic>Thermocrinis</italic>) are truly responsible for streamer formation. Our data in Tengchong supported this observation: microbial composition of the streamer sample from Gumingquan was nearly the same as that in the Gumingquan sediment without streamer, consisting of predominantly <italic>Aquificae</italic> with small amounts of <italic>Thermodesulfobacteria</italic> and <italic>Crenarchaeota</italic> (<italic>Desulfurococcales</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053350-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). In Tengchong, <italic>Hydrogenobacter</italic> was the dominant <italic>Aquificae</italic> in both streamer-forming and non-streamer forming communities. At present, it remains unclear about the mechanisms of streamer formation, although it was possible that some other organisms may be working with <italic>Aquificae</italic> to either encourage or suppress streamer formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-MeyerDombard2">[44]</xref>.</p>
          <p><italic>Sulfurihydrogenibium</italic> is common and abundant in circumneutral springs in YNP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Inskeep1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Yang1">[49]</xref> and the Great Basin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Dodsworth1">[20]</xref>. Its apparent low abundance in Tengchong springs may be related to their low maximum growth temperature of 78°C, which was below the lowest temperature in the circumneutral and alkaline samples reported here except Ruidian springs (Gongxiaoshe and Jinze). The Ruidian springs, however, were expected to have a relatively high dissolved O<sub>2</sub> content due to the long water residence time, which may be incompatible with the microaerophilic nature of <italic>Sulfurihydrogenibium</italic> (optimal O<sub>2</sub> concentration, 6% v/v) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Nakagawa1">[50]</xref>.</p>

          <title>Crenarchaeota</title>
          <p>The crenarchaeal order <italic>Thermoprotei</italic> was abundant in Rehai and also at many sites in YNP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-MeyerDombard1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-MeyerDombard2">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Inskeep2">[47]</xref>, but only a small component in the Great Basin, where <italic>Archaeoglobales</italic>, <italic>Thaumarchaeota</italic>, and yet-uncultivated lineages were more abundant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Dodsworth1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Costa1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Vick1">[53]</xref>. This difference is likely due to the fact that there are no highly acidic springs in the Great Basin (pH &lt;5.5) and therefore cannot support the many members of the order <italic>Thermoprotei</italic> that are generally acidophilic.</p>
          <p>The relative proportions of three orders within this class, <italic>Sulfolobales, Thermoproteales</italic>, and <italic>Desulfurococcales</italic>, correlated with pH and temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053350-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), and other geochemical conditions in Tengchong springs. The predominance of <italic>Sulfolobales</italic> in high temperature, acidic, sulfur-rich sites (Diretiyanqu-1, -2, and -3) in both water and sediment (well mixed with water), is consistent with the oxygen, temperature and pH optima of the genus <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> (i.e., microaerophilic, 65–85°C and 2–3) and the distribution of <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> in acidic sulfataras in YNP and elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Huber1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Whitaker1">[56]</xref>. The dominance of <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> at these springs with high levels of sulfur (primarily sulfate) and ferrous iron suggests that aerobic respiration of sulfide, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, organic matter, and H<sub>2</sub> are dominant metabolisms in high temperature acid springs in Rehai <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Huber1">[55]</xref>. In addition to the genus <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> of the family Sulfolobaceae of the order <italic>Sulfolobales</italic>, the genera <italic>Acidianus</italic> and <italic>Metallosphaera</italic> were also present in low abundance yet neither <italic>Stygiolobus</italic> nor <italic>Sulfurisphaera</italic> were detected. <italic>Stygiolobus</italic>-like sequences were present in YNP springs with dissolved oxygen levels at or below detection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Macur1">[43]</xref>, consistent with the anaerobic nature of this genus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Huber1">[55]</xref>. The possible absence of <italic>Stygiolobus</italic> in Tengchong springs may be due to the oxic nature of these springs.</p>
          <p>The predominance of <italic>Desulfurococcales</italic> in Rehai springs with high temperature (&gt;80°C) and circumneutral to alkaline pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053350-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) is consistent with the known hyperthermophily of these organisms (temperature optima 84–95°C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Huber2">[57]</xref>), but only partly overlaps with the known pH range of known terrestrial genera of <italic>Desulfurococcales</italic> (pH range 2.2–8.5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Huber2">[57]</xref>) and their pH distribution in YNP springs based on cultivation-independent studies (pH range 6.1–8.1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-MeyerDombard1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Macur1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-MeyerDombard2">[44]</xref>. Thus, it appears that <italic>Desulfurococcales</italic> in Tengchong have a higher pH range than other terrestrial <italic>Desulfurococcales</italic>, and even higher than the marine organism <italic>Aeropyrum pernix</italic>, which is able to grow up to pH 9.0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Huber2">[57]</xref>. Interestingly, the two Rehai springs where abundant <italic>Desulfurococcales</italic> were observed, i.e., Gumingquan and Jiemeiquan, also had high levels of Si, Cl, K, and Na in the waters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053350.s009">Table S1</xref>). At present, it is unclear if these ions affected the pH tolerance of <italic>Desulfurococcales</italic>. The higher abundance of <italic>Desulfurococcales</italic> in the sediments of Gumingquan and Jiemeiquan than those in the corresponding waters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053350-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>) may suggest that the sediments may have offered some protection against highly alkaline pH.</p>
          <p>Similar to <italic>Desulfurococcales</italic>, <italic>Thermoproteales</italic> (mainly <italic>Pyrobaculum</italic>) relatives were the most abundant in Rehai springs with high temperature and neutral-alkaline pH (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053350-t003">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053350-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Again the high temperature of these springs is consistent with the hyperthermophilic nature of the genus <italic>Pyrobaculum</italic> (74–102°C with optimum 100°C, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Huber3">[58]</xref>), but the pH of some Rehai springs is higher than both the pH optimum (6–7) and even the maximum (9) known for this genus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Huber3">[58]</xref>. Thus, the <italic>Pyrobaculum</italic> in Rehai are likely to be more alkaliphilic than any known <italic>Thermoproteales</italic> including those from YNP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Inskeep2">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Swingley1">[59]</xref>.

        <p>Sulfide or Fe<sup>2+</sup> oxidation with O<sub>2</sub> as an electron acceptor appears to be an important metabolic pathway in acidic springs of Rehai (Diretiyanqu and Zhenzhuquan, mostly by <italic>Sulfolobus</italic>), as it is in YNP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Kozubal1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053350-Kozubal2">[63]</xref>.

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>Two geothermal fields in Tengchong, Rehai and Ruidian, were highly diverse in their environmental conditions, encompassing a temperature range from 55.1 to 93.6°C and pH from 2.46 to 9.39 as well as wide ranges of water and sediment geochemistry. The overall microbial diversity was low, and did not show any systematic correlation with geochemical conditions. Ruidian sediments hosted higher microbial diversity than the corresponding waters and Rehai samples, likely due to mild temperature, pH, high organic carbon, and different mineralogy (carbonate-dominated).</p>
        <p>The bacterial phylum <italic>Aquificae</italic> and archaeal phylum <italic>Crenarchaeota</italic> were dominant in all samples from Rehai and water samples from Ruidian. The specific compositions of <italic>Aquificae</italic> and <italic>Crenarchaeota</italic> were highly dependent on pH, temperature, and water/sediment geochemistry. Acidic and sulfur-rich springs were dominated by crenarchaeal order <italic>Sulfolobales</italic> and <italic>Aquificae</italic> genus <italic>Hydrogenobaculumn</italic>, whereas neutral to alkaline pH favored the <italic>Aquificae</italic> genus <italic>Hydrogenobacter</italic>, and crenarchaeal orders <italic>Desulfurococcales</italic> and <italic>Thermoproteales</italic>. A higher pH tolerance was observed for <italic>Desulfurococcales</italic> and <italic>Thermoproteales</italic> and this tolerance appeared to be related to water/sediment geochemistry. Whereas many of these organisms have been detected in other terrestrial springs worldwide, some members typically found in other terrestrial hot springs such as <italic>Thermocrinis</italic> were not present or only in minor abundance in Tengchong. This study highlights the importance of temperature, pH and other geochemical conditions and endemism in shaping the microbial community structure in Tengchong hot springs.</p>
