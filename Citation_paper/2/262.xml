<abstract>
<p>Inflammatory stress promotes foam cell formation by disrupting LDL receptor feedback regulation in macrophages. Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Proteins (SREBPs) Cleavage-Activating Protein (SCAP) glycosylation plays crucial roles in regulating LDL receptor and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCoAR) feedback regulation. The present study was to investigate if inflammatory stress disrupts LDL receptor and HMGCoAR feedback regulation by affecting SCAP glycosylation in THP-1 macrophages. Intracellular cholesterol content was assessed by Oil Red O staining and quantitative assay. The expression of molecules controlling cholesterol homeostasis was examined using real-time quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. The translocation of SCAP from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi was detected by confocal microscopy. We demonstrated that exposure to inflammatory cytokines increased lipid accumulation in THP-1 macrophages, accompanying with an increased SCAP expression even in the presence of a high concentration of LDL. These inflammatory cytokines also prolonged the half-life of SCAP by enhancing glycosylation of SCAP due to the elevated expression of the Golgi mannosidase II. This may enhance translocation and recycling of SCAP between the ER and the Golgi, escorting more SREBP2 from the ER to the Golgi for activation by proteolytic cleavages as evidenced by an increased N-terminal of SREBP2 (active form). As a consequence, the LDL receptor and HMGCoAR expression were up-regulated. Interestingly, these effects could be blocked by inhibitors of Golgi mannosidases. Our results indicated that inflammation increased native LDL uptake and endogenous cholesterol de novo synthesis, thereby causing foam cell formation via increasing transcription and protein glycosylation of SCAP in macrophages. These data imply that inhibitors of Golgi processing enzymes might have a potential vascular-protective role in prevention of atherosclerotic foam cell formation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Atherosclerosis, a maladaptive chronic inflammatory response in the vessel wall, is the primary cause of coronary artery disease, stroke and peripheral vascular disease and it thus represents the most common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-National1">[1]</xref>. Macrophage foam cell formation with cholesterol overloading is the defining pathological characteristic of atherosclerotic plaques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Rosenfeld1">[2]</xref>. LDL, the major carrier of plasma cholesterol, enters the vessel wall and macrophages by receptor and non-receptor-mediated mechanisms. Increased serum levels of LDL have been most closely correlated with the incidence of cardiovascular disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Klag1">[3]</xref>. Traditionally, scavenger receptors mediated modified LDL (oxidized or glycosylated) uptake is recognized as the major resource for cholesterol accumulation in monocyte-derived macrophages within atherosclerotic plaques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Kzhyshkowska1">[4]</xref>. However, recent evidence has challenged this paradigm by showing that loss of receptor-mediated lipid uptake via scavenger receptor A or CD36 pathways does not ameliorate atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Moore1">[5]</xref>. Our previous studies also showed that the accelerating effects of inflammatory cytokines on lipid droplets accumulation in various peripheral cells such as human mesangial cells (HMCs), vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Ruan1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Ruan2">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Ye1">[8]</xref>, were not be inhibited by scavenger receptors blocker, but were blocked by LDL receptor (LDLr) specific antibody (MB47) and heparin, which removes LDL bound to the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Ruan2">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Ye1">[8]</xref>. This suggests LDLr pathway involvement in lipid accumulation under inflammatory stress.</p>
<p>LDLr, the primary receptor for binding and internalization of plasma-derived native LDL cholesterol and regulation of plasma LDL concentration, was initially considered unimportant in macrophage cholesterol accumulation and foam cell formation because LDLr gene expression in mammalian cells is normally under tight negative-feedback control via Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein (SREBP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Brown1">[9]</xref>. In mammalian cells, two SREBP genes encode three different isoforms of SREBPs, known as SREBP-1a, -1c and -2. While SREBP-1a is a potent activator of all SREBP-responsive genes, SREBP-1c preferentially enhances the transcription of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis. Conversely, SREBP-2 preferentially activates genes of LDLr involved in cholesterol uptake and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl- CoA reductase (HMGCoAR) involved in cholesterol biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Horton1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>SREBP Cleavage- Activating Protein (SCAP) is a transmembrane protein that serves as a chaperone protein of SREBP2 and sterol sensor, which plays a central role in the SREBP2 activation. When cells are depleted of cholesterol, SCAP delivers the SREBP2 from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi where it is cleaved by two membrane-bound proteases (site 1 protease and site 2 protease) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Brown2">[11]</xref>. Meanwhile SCAP is glycosylated by the sequential action of Golgi enzymes α-mannosidase I, α-mannosidase II and GlcNAc transferase I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Dunphy1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Velasco1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Nohturfft1">[14]</xref>, before recycling to the ER. The sequential cleavages release the active N-terminal fragment of SREBP2 (N-SREBP2) from the Golgi to the nucleus, binding to the sterol regulatory elements in the HMGCoAR and LDLr promoters and activating these genes transcription. When intracellular cholesterol is overloaded, SCAP-SREBP2 complex is retained in the ER and SREBP2 cannot be processed by the proteases in the Golgi. Thereafter the expression of LDLr and HMGCoAR is down-regulated and both cholesterol uptake and de novo synthesis decline. Yuan et al reported that SCAP glycosylation can be decreased by Golgi mannosidase inhibitors, which led to reduced LDLr and HMGCoAR expression and therefore intracellular cholesterol accumulation in HMCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Yuan1">[15]</xref>. It seems that SCAP cycling between the ER and the Golgi regulated by Golgi glycosylation is a key process in the feedback regulation of LDLr and HMGCoAR.</p>
<p>Chronic systemic inflammation is an aggravating factor for lipid-mediated peripheral cell injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Ross1">[16]</xref>. A substantial body of evidence has accumulated linking an increased cardiovascular risk in patients with renal failure and immune dysregulation which facilitates activation of chronic inflammatory response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Swaminathan1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Skaggs1">[18]</xref>. The atherosclerotic patients with elevated levels of acute-phase reactants (reflecting enhanced hepatic production in response to circulating inflammatory cytokines) have a less favorable clinical course than those with normal levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Liuzzo1">[19]</xref>. However, the mechanisms by which activation of the inflammatory response may contribute to atherosclerosis are not fully understood. In the last decades, growing evidences revealed that inflammatory cytokines (i.e. IL-1 and TNF-α) have a direct effect on glycome changes and the cohorts of glycosidases in the Golgi apparatus are the main determining factors of glycome changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Lindn1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Cooke1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Ohtsubo1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>Macrophage is the most important immune response cell and foam cell progenitor. The current experiments were undertaken to investigate whether inflammation disrupts the SCAP mediated feedback regulation for LDLr and HMGCoAR by enhancing SCAP glycosylation by Golgi enzymes, therefore modifies cholesterol homeostasis and promotes cholesterol accumulation in macrophages.</p>

<p>Both cytokines and Golgi glycosylation inhibitors at the given concentrations used in the experiments did not change cell viability as demonstrated by MTT experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075650-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We determined lipid accumulation in THP-1 macrophages in response to inflammatory cytokines and Golgi glycosylation enzyme inhibitors. Both inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α increased Oil Red O staining in the absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075650-g001">Figure 1B: II or III vs I</xref>) or presence of LDL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075650-g001">Figure 1B: V or VI vs IV</xref>) in THP-1 macrophages. Interestingly, effective glycosylation inhibitors (kifunensine and swainsonine) for α-mannosidase I and α-mannosidase II enzymes in Golgi reduced lipid accumulation induced by IL-6 and TNF-α in THP-1 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075650-g001">Figure 1B: VIII or IX vs VII</xref>). The histogram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075650-g001">Figure 1B</xref> shows the quantitative analysis of ORO positive staining. Intracellular cholesterol levels were also quantified using an enzymatic assay. TC was increased in cytokines treated cells in the absence or presence of LDL, which was attributed to the elevated CE but not FC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075650-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The glycosylation inhibitors reduced intracellular CE and therefore TC induced by IL-6 and TNF-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075650-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). These results suggest that intracellular cholesterol accumulation and foam cell formation induced by inflammation can be prevented by effective glycosylation inhibitors.</p>

<p>THP-1 macrophages were incubated in serum free medium for 24 h at 37°C. The medium was then replaced by fresh serum-free medium in the absence (control) (I) or presence of 40 ng/ml IL-6 (II) or 50 ng/ml TNF-α (III) or 25 µg/ml LDL (IV) or 40 ng/ml IL-6 plus 25 µg/ml LDL(V) or 50 ng/ml TNF-α plus 25 µg/ml LDL (VI) or glycosylation inhibitors (VII), or 40 ng/ml IL-6 plus inhibitors (VIII), or 50 ng/ml TNF-α plus inhibitors (IX) for 24 h at 37°C. Cell viability was determined using the MTT assay as described in Methods. Cell viability is expressed as the percentage of absorbance from treated cells compared to untreated cells. Graphs represent the average values (M±SD) of three independent experiments with triplicate biological measurements for each experiment (A). The cells were examined for lipid inclusions by Oil Red O (ORO) staining. The results are typical of those observed in four separate experiments (×400). Semi-quantitative analysis of ORO positive staining was performed by the Image-J software. Results represent mean± SD from 4 separate fields (B). Intracellular free cholesterol and total cholesterol were assayed as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref> section.

<title>The effects of inflammation on LDLr, HMGCoAR and SREBP2 expression</title>
<p>We investigated effects of inflammatory cytokines on the expression of LDLr, HMGCoAR and SREBP2. Either IL-6 or TNF-α upregulated both mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075650-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075650-g002">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>) expression of LDLr and HMGCoAR. In addition, we checked protein levels of N-SREBP2 in nucleus (the active format of SREBP2 for LDLr and HMGCoAR transcription). Both cytokines increased N-SREBP2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075650-g002">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>). LDL loading inhibited SREBP2, HMGCoAR and LDLr expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075650-g002">Figure 2A, 2B and 2C</xref>) as expected (negative feedback regulation). However, cytokines overrode the suppression of these molecules by LDL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075650-g002">Figure 2A, 2B and 2C:</xref> LDL plus cytokines vs LDL alone). These results suggest that inflammation disrupts LDLr and HMGCoAR feedback regulation and increases LDL-cholesterol accumulation by activating SREBP pathway.</p>

<title>The effects of inflammation and Golgi glycosylation enzyme inhibitors on SCAP expression and intracellular translocation</title>
<p>We investigated effects of inflammation on the expression of SCAP.

The Golgi glycosylation enzyme inhibitors showed no effect on SCAP mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075650-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Furthermore, we investigated SCAP translocation between the ER and the Golgi in THP-1 macrophages by confocal microscopy.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Both inflammation and dyslipidemia are aggressive factors in atherosclerosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-National1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Klag1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Libby1">[26]</xref>. Macrophages in the arterial wall, derived from the circulatory monocyte initially serve a protective function by removing cytotoxic and proinflammatory particles or apoptotic cells. However, they are highly heterogeneous cells that can rapidly change their functions in response to local microenvironmental signals, and progressive accumulation of macrophages and their uptake of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Murray1">[27]</xref>. In the present study, we used THP-1 derived macrophages activated by PMA, which are very similar to primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to inflammatory cytokines to study the role of inflammation on LDL metabolism. Our data demonstrated that inflammatory cytokine either IL-6 or TNF-α, which are both biomarkers of chronic systemic inflammation, promoted native LDL accumulation in THP-1 macrophages. Since all experimental media in this study contained the antioxidants EDTA and BHT, both of which powerfully prevent oxidation of LDL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Ruan2">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Ye1">[8]</xref>. In this case, it is highly unlikely that a suitable ligand for the scavenger receptor was present in current experimental conditions. In addition to the results from ORO staining in this study, the intracellular cholesterol quantitative measurements by enzymatic methods also showed that inflammatory cytokines increased TC and CE contents in THP-1 macrophages, though SREBP1-mediated fatty acids synthesis might also be increased. Interestingly, CE, but not FC, was elevated dramatically by administration of inflammatory cytokines. This result may be attributed to the elevated activity and expression of Acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1), which is the key intracellular enzyme catalyzing the formation of cholesteryl esters, under the influence of inflammatory cytokine and LDL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Ruan2">[7]</xref>. The development of macrophage-derived foam cells that contain massive amounts of cholesteryl esters becomes a hallmark of early stage of atherosclerotic lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Libby2">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Chang1">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated that inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α increased both mRNA and protein expression of SCAP. It seems that cholesterol level may be decreased in the ER under inflammatory stress since the elevated ACAT activity converts more FC to CE, This may result in insufficient cholesterol content to retain SCAP in the ER in the presence of inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Hua1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Ma2">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Ruan2">[7]</xref>. Therefore, increased SCAP expression results in SCAP translocation from the ER to the Golgi as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075650-g005">Figure 5</xref>. This abnormal escape of the SCAP shuttles more SREBP2 to the Golgi for cleavages, which produces extra N-SREBP2, leading to up-regulation of LDLr and HMGCoAR even in the presence of a high concentration of LDL which normally inhibits this process.</p>
<p>Glycosylation is a frequent post-translational modification of proteins which modulates a variety of biological functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Ohtsubo1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Hart1">[32]</xref>. Two Golgi enzymes (α-mannosidase I and α-mannosidase II) are considered responsible for SCAP glycosylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Yuan1">[15]</xref>. The α-mannosidase II is an enzyme in the N-linked glycosylation pathway that is responsible for the removal of the terminal α1–3-and α1–6-linked mannose residues prior to the addition of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues which are required for the synthesis of complex-type asparagine (N)-linked glycans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Kreisman1">[33]</xref>. In this study, we demonstrated that in inflammatory cytokine treated macrophages, the mRNA and protein expression of α-mannosidase II (not α-mannosidase I) was increased, accompanying with increased lipid droplet deposition and activation of SREBP2/LDLr pathway. Meanwhile, the increased SCAP stability by cytokines was resulted from the increased SCAP Golgi glycosylation by α-mannosidase II. Interestingly, Golgi glycosylation enzyme inhibitors strikingly attenuated the translocation of SCAP from the ER to the Golgi and reduced the levels of LDLr, HMGCoAR and N-SREBP2, preventing lipid droplet deposition induced by cytokines. It seems that glycosylation of SCAP may prevent SCAP degradation and prolong SCAP half-life, facilitating SCAP recycling between the ER and the Golgi, and activating SREBP2/LDLr pathway. Interestingly, it showed no significant effects of inhibitors on SREBP2, LDLR and HMGCoAR mRNA level in the non-inflamed group. This might suggest that the effect of inhibitors on the downstream molecules are mild in physical conditions, however, the effect can be strikingly amplified in inflamed conditions. The mechanisms by which inflammation regulates SCAP gene expression and posttranslational modification are not clear. We have previously demonstrated that knocking down of MyD88 or using IKK inhibitor in THP-1 derived macrophages attenuates the increase of SCAP and its down-stream molecules (N-SREBP2 and LDLr) by inflammation, suggesting a crosstalk between inflammation and SCAP expression pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075650-Li1">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>Taken together, we demonstrated that inflammation increases expression and potential glycosylation of SCAP in the Golgi by increasing expression of Golgi α-mannosidase II, causing an abnormal translocation of SCAP from the ER to the Golgi and enhancing recycling of SCAP complex between the ER and the Golgi. These processes increase SREBP2 cleavages and produce more N-SREBP2 which consequently activates LDLr and HMGCoAR expression and lipid accumulation in THP-1 macrophages. These results may improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of atherosclerosis and also suggest that anti-inflammation or Golgi glycosylation enzyme inhibitors may be useful adjunctive therapeutic agents in the management of atherosclerosis.</p>
