<abstract>
<p>The Prep1 (Pknox1) homeodomain transcription factor is essential at multiple stages of embryo development. In the E11.5 embryo trunk, we previously estimated that Prep1 binds about 3,300 genomic sites at a highly specific decameric consensus sequence, mainly governing basal cellular functions. We now show that in embryonic stem (ES) cells Prep1 binding pattern only partly overlaps that of the embryo trunk, with about 2,000 novel sites. Moreover, in ES cells Prep1 still binds mostly to promoters, as in total embryo trunk but, among the peaks bound exclusively in ES cells, the percentage of enhancers was three-fold higher. RNA-seq identifies about 1800 genes down-regulated in <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells which belong to gene ontology categories not enriched in the E11.5 <italic>Prep1<sup>i/i</sup></italic> differentiated embryo, including in particular essential components of the Wnt and Fgf pathways. These data agree with aberrant Wnt and Fgf expression levels in the <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells with a deficient embryoid bodies (EBs) formation and differentiation. Re-establishment of the Prep1 level rescues the phenotype.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Prep1 (Pknox1) homeodomain transcription factor belongs to the TALE (Three Amino acids Loop Extension) family of proteins that includes also Prep2, Pbx1-4 and Meis1-3 [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122518.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Prep1 dimerization with Pbx proteins through the amino-terminal domain provides DNA-binding activity to both proteins. In turn, the dimers can bind anterior Hox proteins through the Pbx homeodomain, forming functional trimers with higher DNA affinity and selectivity [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> embryos die before gastrulation because the epiblast undergoes p53-dependent apoptosis around E6.25 [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. On the other hand, hypomorphic <italic>Prep1</italic><sup><italic>i/i</italic></sup> embryos (expressing only 2% of the normal <italic>Prep1</italic> mRNA level) die mostly at E17.5 with an hematopoietic phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Double <italic>Prep1</italic><sup><italic>-/i</italic></sup> heterozygotes display an intermediate phenotype dying at E12.5 with major cranial and brain defects [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Thus Prep1 is essential in at least three different stages of development: pre-gastrulation (0% expression), brain-cranium formation (1%) and hematopoiesis (2%). So the expression of different, even if low, levels of <italic>Prep1</italic> can have a major impact on the embryo phenotype.</p>
<p>In the adult, Prep1 behaves as a tumor suppressor since the few surviving hypomorphic <italic>Prep1</italic><sup><italic>i/I</italic></sup> and the apparently normal <italic>Prep1</italic><sup><italic>+/i</italic></sup> heterozygous mice develop a variety of tumors with age. Likewise, Prep1 haploinsufficiency accelerates Myc-driven lymphomagenesis [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122518.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The underlying mechanism appears to be DNA damage since <italic>Prep1</italic> down-regulation acutely causes an accumulation of double-strand DNA breaks and chromosomal aberrations [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, <italic>Prep1</italic> exerts multiple functions in different cells during mouse embryo development and in the adult. Moreover, <italic>Prep1</italic> has an essential role in at least some stem cells, since the function and self renewal of hematopoietic stem cells is deficient in <italic>Prep1</italic><sup><italic>i/i</italic></sup> embryos [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122518.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Moreover, <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> blastocysts produce fewer and deficient ES cells [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Despite its almost ubiquitous expression pattern [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the different <italic>Prep1</italic> phenotypes in different cells suggest that the identification of target genes may help discriminating between its different functions. On the basis of the above considerations, one would expect different genes to be targeted in different cells. We have previously identified by ChIP-seq the Prep1 target genes in the whole E11.5 embryo trunk [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] which represents a mixed population of embryonic progenitors and differentiated cells. Prep1 binds to a specific decameric DNA sequence at over three thousand genes, with great preference for promoters and mostly in the form of a Pbx1 heterodimer. Despite the genetic relevance of <italic>Prep1</italic> in embryonic development, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that in the cells of the embryo trunk Prep1-bound genes are enriched particularly in categories involved much more in basic cellular functions than in developmental regulation [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
<p>Embryonic stem (ES) cells are pluripotent stem cells that derive from the blastocyst and are able, when re-implanted in the blastocyst, to reproduce an entire embryo. Moreover, they can be differentiated <italic>in vitro</italic> into a variety of tissues [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Prep1 and Pbx1 proteins are expressed in ES cells and the Pbx1 level is regulated upon differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
<p>In ES cells, because of the very low level of Meis1, the Prep1-Pbx complexes can bind DNA in the absence of the potentially antagonizing Meis1-Pbx1 dimers. Identifying target genes in ES cells might give information on Prep1 functions which might have escaped in the whole E11.5 embryo trunk analysis because of the major contribution of differentiated cells and of the presence of different progenitors.</p>
<p>We have identified Prep1 target genes in ES cells combining DNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq), and compared globally the relative gene expression level in wild type (WT) v. <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells (RNA-seq). While confirming the general rules of binding of Prep1 to DNA drawn from the embryo analysis [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], we have also uncovered major specific differences. First, in ES cells Prep1 targets a gene population that overlaps only by one third with that of the embryo trunk, thus enlarging the spectrum of the Prep1 binding sites. In particular in ES cells Prep1 targets several components of the Fgf and Wnt signaling pathways, which were not apparent in the embryo study. The control by Prep1 of Fgf and Wnt pathways is evidentiated by a deficient expression of some of their members in <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells upon <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation.</p>
<p>Since Prep1 binds DNA preferentially as a Pbx dimer, and since Pbx can form dimers also with other transcription factors of the same TALE family, the phenotype of the <italic>Prep1</italic> deletion may be due not only to the absence of Prep1 (loss of function), but also to a relative increase of antagonistic dimers (gain of function). Instead, we show that in <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells the level of Pbx1 and Pbx2 is strongly decreased in <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells. Finally, re-establishment of the Prep1 level in <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells rescues the deficiency in embryoid bodies formation at the cellular and at least in part at the molecular level.</p>

<title>Prep1 ChIP-seq in mouse ES cells identifies novel target genes</title>
<p>The original ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data of this experiment have been deposited in GEO and can be accessed with the GSE63282 accession number.</p>
<p>We performed a ChIP-seq study of wild type ES cells using an anti-Prep1 antibody (see <xref rid="sec009" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). The fragmented chromatin (average size 200 bp) was immunoprecipitated and the DNA deep-sequenced alongside with the non immunoprecipitated input. Using a threshold <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;10<sup>-6</sup> and an FDR (false discovery rate) &lt;20% in the immunoprecipitation v. input comparison, we identified 3902 peaks bound by Prep1 (<xref rid="pone.0122518.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>) and mapped them with respect to transcriptional start sites (TSS) (<xref rid="pone.0122518.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Of all peaks, 1271 were associated to a TSS (from -500 to +100). The TSS-distal peaks were classified as intragenic, close intergenic (&lt;20 Kb from TSS) and far intergenic (&gt;20 Kb) (<xref rid="pone.0122518.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Cross-analysis with published data from ES cells [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] established that 1152 of the TSS-proximal peaks had histones modification marks (H3K4Me3<sup>+</sup> and RNA-Pol-II<sup>+</sup>) identifying active promoters. The same promoter features were shared also by some TSS-distal peaks: 437 intragenic, 252 close intergenic and 169 far intergenic (<xref rid="pone.0122518.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), bringing the total of H3K4Me3<sup>+</sup> and RNA-Pol-II<sup>+</sup> peaks (i.e. promoters) to 2010.</p>

<p>Likewise [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], 393 non TSS-associated Prep1-bound peaks had histone modifications (H3K4Me1<sup>+</sup> and H3K4Me3<sup>-</sup>) identifying TSS-distal enhancers (<xref rid="pone.0122518.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Only two peaks with these properties were detected in proximity of a TSS (see <xref rid="pone.0122518.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> legend).

<p>We also observed that the scores (-10[log10 p-value]) of the Prep1 TSS-proximal peaks could be correlated with the presence of the H3K4Me3<sup>+</sup> and RNA PolII<sup>+</sup> promoter marks, i.e. that in the TSS-proximal peaks those containing promoter marks were more enriched (<xref rid="pone.0122518.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>The DNA consensus sequence targeted by Prep1 (MEME program, ref [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]) was the same observed with the embryo trunk [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], i.e. a decameric (DECA) sequence of the format tGAxtGaCag (<xref rid="pone.0122518.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>), which was present in 2750 (70%) peaks. The Meis1 target sequence tGATtxAT (OCTA) was not enriched among the other targets. However, when we used the Meis1 consensus sequence [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] to interrogate our data set, we found that it could be found with about 10% frequency. As these sequences were observed only in peaks that in the embryo trunk [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] were shared between Prep1 and Meis1, they may represent possible Meis1 binding sites.</p>
<p>Comparison (<xref rid="pone.0122518.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) of the Prep1 peaks from ES (this paper) and E11.5 embryo trunks [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] shows that the total number of peaks was not drastically different (3902 v. 3332), but that a major proportion of peaks was ES or embryo-exclusive (ES<sup>exc</sup> and Embryo<sup>exc</sup>, respectively), with 47.2% among ES v. 38% among embryo peaks (<xref rid="pone.0122518.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). When we considered genes rather than peaks, eliminating peaks present more than once per gene, and far intergenic peaks that cannot be assigned with certainty to a specific gene, the numbers decreased but the difference still remained significant (<xref rid="pone.0122518.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). In ES cells, the number of promoter and enhancers peaks (see above) represented 51% and 10% of the total peaks, respectively, comparable with 54 and 4.7% in the embryo (<xref rid="pone.0122518.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). However, among the ES<sup>exc</sup> peaks, 25% were in promoters and 16.9% in enhancers (25% and 5.8% in the embryo<sup>exc</sup>), which is 3-fold higher than in peaks that are shared with the embryo trunk (<xref rid="pone.0122518.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>We next compared the median score in the ES<sup>exc</sup> v. ES-embryo common peaks. As shown in the Boxplot of <xref rid="pone.0122518.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>, the median score in ES<sup>exc</sup> peaks was clearly lower than in those peaks common to ES cells and embryos, independently of their proximity to a TSS. Thus the ES<sup>exc</sup> peaks might represent either lower affinity binding sites, or sites that are bound in a smaller sub-population of cells.</p>
<p>Some of the peaks bound by Prep1 only in the ES cells and not in the embryo trunk (ES<sup>exc</sup>) were validated by conventional ChIP analysis using <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells and nonimmune IgG as negative controls (<xref rid="pone.0122518.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>). The degree of enrichment obtained by the immunoprecipitation was determined directly by conventional ChIP on the <italic>Suv420h2</italic> gene that is bound in both embryo trunk and ES cells (<xref rid="pone.0122518.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, in ES cells Prep1 binds to the same consensus sequence identified in the whole embryo trunk [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However a novel set of ES-cells specific genes has been identified, in which the enhancer regions reach &gt;60% of promoters.</p>

<title>Differential gene expression in WT v. <italic>Prep1</italic> KO ES cells</title>
<p>We have analyzed the transcriptome of wild type and <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells (KO2 line) by RNA-seq. 21,446 RNA transcripts from the sense strand were detected in wild type ES cells (<xref rid="pone.0122518.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). From these we considered only those (13,298) RNAs whose level of expression (number of reads per kilobase per million mapped reads, RPKM) was &gt;1, in order to avoid false differential expression caused by oscillations around a too low basal expression. In this group we set an arbitrary threshold to define Prep1-regulated genes, i.e. those in which the effect of the absence of <italic>Prep1</italic> resulted in an over 30% decrease (KO/WT ratio &lt;0.7) or 50% increase (KO/WT ratio &gt;1.5) in expression.</p>
<p>We found 910 overexpressed genes in which the <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>/WT RPKM expression ratio was &gt;1.5 and 1802 down-regulated genes in which the ratio was &lt;0.7 (<xref rid="pone.0122518.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0122518.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> Tables). Thus, the most frequent effect of the absence of Prep1 was a down-regulation of gene expression. Among the up-regulated genes (<xref rid="pone.0122518.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>), GO analysis showed only two statistically significant categories (<xref rid="pone.0122518.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>), one of which being “organ development”. On the contrary, the genes down-regulated in <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells (<xref rid="pone.0122518.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>) were more significantly enriched in developmental categories like “multicellular organism development”, “tissue development”, “embryonic morphogenesis”, in addition to “regulation of metabolic processes”, “regulation of signaling”, “regulation of cell death” (<xref rid="pone.0122518.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). It is important to notice that in the RNA-seq analysis of the <italic>Prep1</italic><sup><italic>i/i</italic></sup> hypomorphic embryo trunks the “developmental categories” were absent among those significantly enriched by the down-regulation of the gene [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>

<title>Validation of the RNA-seq data in differentiating <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells</title>
<p>In order to probe into the physiological significance of the above data we have analyzed the differentiation of independent <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cell lines <italic>in vitro</italic> (KO1 and KO2). First, we looked at the efficiency of embryoid bodies (EB) formation [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells were previously shown to form EBs, which were smaller than wild-type and displayed increased apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The smaller size of <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> EBs was particularly evident at a low (200) ES cell plating number; the difference became progressively more evident during differentiation (<xref rid="pone.0122518.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). In addition, the external layer of the Prep1 KO EBs, which represents the <italic>in vitro</italic> counterpart of the primitive endoderm in the pre-implantation embryos, was rough and cells seemed to be loose. On the contrary the surface of WT EBs was smooth and cells were tightly attached to each other. Quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) revealed that during differentiation of Prep1 KO EBs, the stemness markers <italic>Oct4</italic> and in particular <italic>Nanog</italic> were down-regulated later than in WT (<xref rid="pone.0122518.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). In addition, we found that the induction of the endodermal marker <italic>Gata4</italic> was significantly decreased. Similar results were observed in WT ES cells down-regulated with a <italic>Prep1</italic> shRNA (<xref rid="pone.0122518.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>).</p>

<p>RNA-seq data showed that genes of the Fgf pathway are affected by <italic>Prep1</italic> deletion (<xref rid="pone.0122518.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) and ChIP-seq analysis included <italic>Fgf4</italic> among the direct targets of Prep1 (<xref rid="pone.0122518.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). This result was of particular interest since Fgf signaling is essential for the first steps of ES differentiation and primitive endoderm formation [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122518.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In fact RT-qPCR analysis of differentiating Prep1 KO EBs showed an anomalous behavior of <italic>Fgf4</italic> expression. <italic>Fgf4</italic> level was about 30% lower in Prep1 KO ES cells than in WT, but during differentiation it persisted and did not decrease as in WT (<xref rid="pone.0122518.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). While the mechanism whereby Prep1 regulates the level of <italic>Fgf4</italic> is not known, the direct binding of Prep1 to the <italic>Fgf4</italic> promoter (<xref rid="pone.0122518.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>) was also verified by a specific ChIP in ES cells. Indeed, while the genomic region 1 of the Fgf4 promoter (<xref rid="pone.0122518.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>) containing the Prep1 binding site (TGATTGGCAG) was enriched upon immunoprecipitation with an anti-Prep1 antibody, a nearby region 2 lacking this site was not (<xref rid="pone.0122518.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>).</p>

<p>In addition, <italic>FgfR2</italic> and <italic>FgfR3</italic> RNA levels were reduced by two to ten fold in Prep1 KO cells (<xref rid="pone.0122518.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). Similar results were obtained in WT ES cells down-regulated with Prep1-specific shRNA (<xref rid="pone.0122518.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). The effect of Prep1 on the <italic>Fgfr</italic>’s must however be indirect, since these genes are not bound by Prep1 in ES cells (<xref rid="pone.0122518.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). A down-regulation of the Fgf pathway in <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells during differentiation might be involved in the delayed formation of the primitive endoderm in <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> EBs, as shown by a lower and delayed expression of <italic>Gata4</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0122518.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>Re-expression of <italic>Prep1</italic> completely rescued the size, appearance and the growth of <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> EBs (<xref rid="pone.0122518.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). Moreover, also the levels of <italic>Nanog</italic>, <italic>Gata4</italic> and <italic>Fgf4</italic> were restored and brought back to that of WT (<xref rid="pone.0122518.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>).

Likewise, <italic>Gata4</italic> was induced 40% more after re-expression of <italic>Prep1</italic>. Similarly, <italic>Fgf4</italic> was increased by about 40% and was down-regulated faster during differentiation. Finally, the expression levels of <italic>FgfR2</italic> and <italic>FgfR3</italic> were also rescued (<xref rid="pone.0122518.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>).</p>

<p>In agreement with the RNA-seq data (<xref rid="pone.0122518.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), we also observed that the time course of <italic>Wnt</italic> genes expression during differentiation of EBs was drastically modified in the absence of <italic>Prep1</italic>. In particular at day 5 of EB differentiation, RT-qPCR data showed that <italic>Wnt3</italic> and <italic>Wnt3a</italic> were less expressed by &gt;60% in <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells (<xref rid="pone.0122518.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). The expression of other <italic>Wnts</italic> was also strongly affected during differentiation of <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells (<xref rid="pone.0122518.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>), as also suggested by the RNA-seq data on <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells of <xref rid="pone.0122518.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. <italic>Wnt9b</italic> was down-regulated by 30%, while others were overexpressed: <italic>Wnt7b</italic> (8-fold), <italic>Wnt7a</italic> (5-fold) and <italic>Wnt6</italic> (2.5-fold). <italic>Wnt8a</italic> and <italic>Wnt9a</italic> showed no change. Thus, since the expression of many <italic>Wnt</italic> genes is affected in the <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> background, we conclude that Prep1 can also influence the Wnt pathway and its absence may affect Wnt-dependent early embryo development and ES cells differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Indeed, as indicated by the ChIP-seq data (<xref rid="pone.0122518.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>) and confirmed by a specific ChIP PCR (<xref rid="pone.0122518.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>), the Wnt3 gene was proven to be a direct target of Prep1.

IgG control with WT chromatin or anti-Prep1 antibody with <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> chromatin showed no enrichment (<xref rid="pone.0122518.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>).

<title>The absence of Prep1 affects the formation of the Primitive Endoderm <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>The observation of an altered expression of <italic>Gata4</italic> in Prep1 KO EB prompted us to analyze Prep1 KO embryos at E4.5, which represent their <italic>in vivo</italic> counterpart. <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> embryos die at about E6.25 due to p53-dependent apoptosis of the epiblast [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. At E4.5, <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> blastocysts exhibit a normal morphology, with a well identifiable trophectoderm (Cdx2-positive), Epiblast (Nanog-positive) and primitive endoderm (PE) (Gata4 positive cells) as shown by immunofluorescence (IF) (<xref rid="pone.0122518.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>). However, quantification revealed that among the cells of the inner cell mass, the Gata4-expressing PE cells represented a slightly smaller fraction in <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> than in WT embryos (<xref rid="pone.0122518.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>), a difference which was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.01).

<title>The absence of Prep1 affects the expression of Pbx proteins in ES cells</title>
<p>Since Prep1 binds DNA as a dimer with Pbx, and since Pbx1 interacts also with other members of the TALE family, the absence of Prep1 might lead to occupancy of Prep1 sites by other Pbx dimers, i.e. Pbx-Meis1. However, it is known that the absence of Prep1 might also affect the level of its partner Pbx since Prep1 dimerization stabilizes Pbx proteins in some cells [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The question therefore arises whether the anomalies of the <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells reflect only the absence of Prep1 or also the effect of alternative Pbx dimers. If the absence of Prep1 leads to a decrease in Pbx protein level, the latter possibility would be much less likely. We have tested therefore the level of expression of Pbx proteins in <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells. We compared one WT to two <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cell lines (KO1 and KO2) and also infected <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells with expression vectors for Prep1 to re-establish its expression. Immunoblotting analysis showed, in addition to the loss of Prep1 in both <italic>Prep1</italic> null ES cell lines (<xref rid="pone.0122518.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A</xref>), also a major decrease of Pbx1a, Pbx1b and Pbx2 (<xref rid="pone.0122518.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122518.g008" ref-type="fig">8C</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0122518.g008" ref-type="fig">8E</xref>), whereas no effect was observed for Pbx3 which however was present mostly in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="pone.0122518.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8D</xref>). Unlike the decrease in protein, <italic>Prep1</italic> null ES cell lines did not show an equivalent decrease in the mRNA of <italic>Pbx1</italic>, <italic>Pbx2</italic> or <italic>Pbx3</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0122518.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8F</xref>). In <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cell lines in which Prep1 level had been re-established infecting cells with a <italic>Prep1</italic> expression vector, the level of Pbx1 and Pbx2 was restored (<xref rid="pone.0122518.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122518.g008" ref-type="fig">8B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0122518.g008" ref-type="fig">8E</xref>). We conclude therefore that the Prep1 deficiency causes a depletion of the Pbx proteins from the nucleus by a post-transcriptional (possibly destabilizing) mechanism, and that the phenotype observed was mostly due to the loss of the Pbx-Prep1 and not to the formation of alternative complexes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In contrast to its ubiquitous expression [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122518.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Prep1 exerts multiple functions. Indeed, while the ChIP-seq analysis of the E11.5 embryo trunk showed that Prep1 controls mainly basic or house-keeping genes [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], the presence of ES cells-specific Prep1 binding sites reported in this paper supports a direct involvement in the developmental process. Indeed, embryonic phenotypes range from epiblast apoptosis, to brain damage, impaired hematopoiesis and cranio-facial development [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122518.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122518.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>
<p>There are two novel discoveries reported in this paper: the cell type-specificity of at least a fraction of Prep1 binding sites and the direct involvement of Prep1 in the Fgf and Wnt signaling pathways. There is a large difference in binding sites between the ES cells (this paper) and the total embryo trunk [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Since the E11.5 embryo represents a mixture of mostly differentiated cells and different types of progenitors, some of the novel ES cells sites may even be specific for stem cells.</p>
<p>The GO analysis of embryo’s DNA-binding sites showed that basic cellular, and not development-related, functions were enriched among Prep1 targets [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The GO analysis of the ES cells data, on the other hand, is not enriched in basic cellular functions, but highlights a different set of gene categories, which include signaling pathways involved in embryo development. In particular, the Wnt and Fgf genes are highly enriched among those dysregulated in the <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells (Tables <xref rid="pone.0122518.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0122518.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Wnt and Fgf ligands are required for very important processes in embryo development. These were not evidentiated as important Prep1 targets in the total embryo trunk study [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], possibly because of the presence of mixed lineages in the analyzed material.</p>
<p>The RNA-seq expression data have been validated using quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting both in ES cells and in differentiating <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> EBs confirming that the absence of Prep1 has a major effect on the genes of the Fgf (<italic>Fgf4</italic> and two Fgf receptors) and Wnt pathways. At the same time, these studies have validated a role of Prep1 in the ES cells differentiation. Indeed, the level of expression of many genes that are essential for embryo development, as well as the timing of their induction/repression upon ES cells differentiation, was drastically modified upon <italic>Prep1</italic> down-regulation. This is not the first example of TALE proteins control of the Fgf signaling in ES cells, as Pbx1 was already shown to regulate the expression of <italic>Fgf8</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p>
<p>Part of the anomalies observed in the E4.5 <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> embryo, a minor, but significant, delay of appearance or decrease of PE cells and of their marker <italic>Gata4</italic>, may be correlated with the perturbation of the Fgf pathway. PE formation requires Fgf4 and its receptors and in this process <italic>Nanog</italic> must be down-regulated and <italic>Gata4</italic> up-regulated. Indeed, in <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> EB the activity of the Fgf pathway is altered, <italic>Nanog</italic> disappearance is delayed and <italic>Gata4</italic> is not up-regulated. These metabolic alterations may also contribute to the subsequent (around E6.0) apoptosis of the <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> epiblast [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
<p>The dysregulation of Wnt genes supports previous evidences of a role of Prep1 in Wnt signaling [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122518.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In addition, it may also hypothetically explain some features of the <italic>Prep1</italic> phenotypes, like the absence of <italic>Hoxb1b</italic> (the zebrafish equivalent of mammalian <italic>Hoxa1</italic>) as well as of <italic>Hoxb2</italic> and <italic>Hoxb4</italic> in the R1–R4 rhombomeres of zebrafish, which has major consequences on the cranial nerves formation and neural crest cells (branchial arch 1) migration and differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Indeed, <italic>Wnt3</italic> and <italic>Wnt3a</italic> are essential for anterior-posterior patterning and their functions are connected with <italic>Hox</italic> genes expression [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122518.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>
<p>We have previously observed that some TALE genes can be bound by TALE proteins [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], suggesting possible cross-regulation, although this possibility has not been really explored. Prep1 binds strongly (one of the strongest ChIP-seq peaks) in the vicinity of the TSS of its own gene (<italic>Pknox1</italic>) in both total embryo and ES cells (<xref rid="pone.0122518.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref> and ref [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]). It would be worthwhile exploring further the actual auto-regulation and cross-regulations of TALE genes.</p>
<p>Another, possibly important, difference between total embryo trunk and ES cells is the three-fold higher binding of Prep1 to enhancers among the ES<sup>exc</sup> peaks (<xref rid="pone.0122518.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). As enhancers are involved in the “regulation” of gene expression more than promoters, this difference might indicate a more subtle regulatory function of Prep1 in ES than in differentiated cells.</p>
<p>Finally, Prep1 mostly binds DNA in complex with Pbx1 at the level of promoters [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells, the absence of Prep1 significantly affects the level of the Pbx1 and Pbx2 proteins by a post-transcriptional mechanism, leading to a decrease of Pbx proteins. Within the Prep1-Pbx1 dimer, it is Prep1 that drives Pbx1 to bind at a specific DNA sequence [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], while possibly Pbx1 provides the information for the specific (activating or repressing) function [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We have not investigated the nature of the Prep1-dependent Pbx1 stabilization. However, a similar effect has been observed in other cells where it was ascribed to inhibition of Pbx1 proteasomal degradation [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>

<title>ChIP-seq</title>
<p>Chromatin immunoprecipitations (IP) were performed using standard methods with anti-Prep1 antibody (N15, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, USA). This antibody can also recognize, much more weakly, Prep2 (our unpublished data). Mouse R1 embryonic stem cells [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] (10<sup>8</sup> cells) were cross-linked in complete medium (10% FBS) containing 1% formaldehyde for 10 min, the reaction was terminated by addition of 125 mM glycine. Fixed cells were washed three times (5 min each) in cold PBS and lysed in LB1 buffer (LB2 buffer containing 0.5% NP-40 and 0.25% triton X-100). Nuclei were then washed in LB2 buffer (10mM Tris-HCl pH = 8 and 200 mM NaCl) to remove detergents and resuspended in LB3 buffer (LB2 buffer containing 0.1% Na-deoxycholate and 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine). Chromatin was sonicated 5 times for 30 sec at 30% of the maximum power of a Branson 450 sonicator to generate 100–400 bp chromatin fragments. After clearing by centrifugation, sonicated chromatin was incubated with antibody-bound protein A-conjugated magnetic beads (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). For each IP we used 10 μg antibody. IP with rabbit IgG was performed as negative control. After overnight IP at 4°C the bound complexes were washed twice in WB1 (50 mM Hepes-KOH pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton-X100, 0.1% Na-doexycholate), twice in WB2 (50 mM Hepes-KOH pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton-X100, 0.1% Na-doexycholate) and twice in LiCl WB (10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 250 mM LiCl, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA). Immunoprecipitated complexes were eluted from the beads by incubation for 30 min in EB (2% SDS in TE) at 37°C. The eluted material was reverse cross-linked at 65°C overnight and incubated for 1 h at 55°C with proteinase K. The obtained material was extracted with phenol-chloroform and ethanol precipitated. After RNAse treatment, the DNA was purified with a PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Netherlands). About 10 ng of immunoprecipitated DNA were processed for sequencing.</p>

<title>ChIP-seq data analysis</title>
<p>Chromatin-immunoprecipitated DNA was sequenced using an Illumina GAII analyzer. Single-end 36 bp reads were first mapped with BWA software [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] against the mm9 version of the mouse genome. Peak-calling was performed using MACS peak-calling algorithm [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. De novo motif discovery was run to identify consensus sequences enriched in the selected regions versus the whole genome using MEME as de novo motif finder algorithm [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The set of peak coordinates was intersected with the sets of peaks obtained for total mouse embryo [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] considering as same peaks when overlapping at least by 50%. Individual instances of the core motif within all peaks were searched with a local install of the FIMO (Find Individual Motif Occurrences) program from the MEME suite [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] with default parameters (individual p-value cutoff 10<sup>-4</sup>).</p>

<title>RNA-seq</title>
<p>For RNA-seq, total RNA was purified from mouse WT and Prep1 KO2 ES cells(see below) [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The mRNA was purified and the library for Illumina chromatin sequencing prepared according to the Illumina recommendations. mRNA samples were sequenced using the paired-end 50 bp protocol. Reads (~7M per sample) were mapped and transcript expression estimated using RSEM [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This program aligns the reads against a set of predefined transcripts (in our case mouse ensemble 63 gene build) and uses an expectation maximization algorithm to assign reads probabilistically to one of the isoforms of a given gene. The quantification results from RSEM were then analyzed with the Bioconductor package DESeq [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], which fits a negative binomial distribution to estimate technical and biological variability.</p>

<title>RNA-seq data analysis</title>
<p>Peak overlapping and correlation with RNA-seq data were performed on the Galaxy bioinformatics platform [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122518.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Peak association with regulated genes was estimated by calculating peak density per megabase in all Ensembl v63 nuclear genes, their promoters and close intergenic regions and comparing with the corresponding values for genes up- or down-regulated in <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells. Peak overlap with histone modification data was established by considering 3000 pb around the summit of the histone mark peaks and intersecting with transcription factor peaks.</p>

<p><italic>Prep1</italic> WT and two <italic>Prep1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> (KO1 and KO2) C57Bl6 ES cells were derived in the laboratory [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. They were cultured in 0.2% Gelatin-coated dishes in Glasgow-modified Eagle’s MEM complemented with 15% ES screened FBS (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA), under standard conditions with 1000 U/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF; Chemicon, CA, USA). Down regulation of <italic>Prep1</italic> in WT ES cells was obtained by infecting the cells with a pLKO.1 vector containing an shRNA against <italic>Prep1</italic> (Thermo Scientific #RMM3981-201784941) or a scrambled sequence for controls (#RHS4080). Overexpression of Prep1 was obtained by infection of the cells with a pMSCVpuro vector containing mouse <italic>Prep1</italic> cDNA while control cells were infected with an empty vector. Embryoid bodies (EBs) were obtained using the standard hanging drops protocol [<xref rid="pone.0122518.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], plating two hundred cells per drop in LIF-free ES medium.</p>
