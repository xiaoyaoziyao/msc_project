          <title>Background</title>
          <p>The polycomb group protein Ezh2 is an epigenetic repressor of transcription originally found to prevent untimely differentiation of pluripotent embryonic stem cells. We previously demonstrated that Ezh2 is also expressed in multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs). We showed that Ezh2 expression is downregulated during NSC differentiation into astrocytes or neurons. However, high levels of Ezh2 remained present in differentiating oligodendrocytes until myelinating. This study aimed to elucidate the target genes of Ezh2 in NSCs and in premyelinating oligodendrocytes (pOLs).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing to detect the target genes of Ezh2 in NSCs and pOLs. We found 1532 target genes of Ezh2 in NSCs. During NSC differentiation, the occupancy of these genes by Ezh2 was alleviated. However, when the NSCs differentiated into oligodendrocytes, 393 of these genes remained targets of Ezh2. Analysis of the target genes indicated that the repressive activity of Ezh2 in NSCs concerns genes involved in stem cell maintenance, in cell cycle control and in preventing neural differentiation. Among the genes in pOLs that were still repressed by Ezh2 were most prominently those associated with neuronal and astrocytic committed cell lineages. Suppression of Ezh2 activity in NSCs caused loss of stem cell characteristics, blocked their proliferation and ultimately induced apoptosis. Suppression of Ezh2 activity in pOLs resulted in derangement of the oligodendrocytic phenotype, due to re-expression of neuronal and astrocytic genes, and ultimately in apoptosis.</p>

          <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
          <p>Our data indicate that the epigenetic repressor Ezh2 in NSCs is crucial for proliferative activity and maintenance of neural stemness. During differentiation towards oligodendrocytes, Ezh2 repression continues particularly to suppress other neural fate choices. Ezh2 is completely downregulated during differentiation towards neurons and astrocytes allowing transcription of these differentiation programs. The specific fate choice towards astrocytes or neurons is apparently controlled by epigenetic regulators other than Ezh2.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs) give rise to neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Insight in the molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying NSC self-renewal and differentiation into each of these cell types is of fundamental importance for understanding proper brain development, for explaining brain tumor formation and for application of NSCs in regenerative therapies for various neurodegenerative disorders.</p>
      <p>The differentiation of NSCs into a specific neural cell type is ultimately determined by an interplay between extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Several signaling pathways are intricately involved in triggering a distinct set of transcription factors, which in turn set off the transcription of genes that determine a specific neural cell type. In case of neuronal differentiation, it is essential that, besides active transcription of neuronal genes, the transcription of genes encoding for a glial fate is suppressed and in case of glial cell differentiation, vice versa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Fan1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Hirabayashi1">[4]</xref>. It has become clear that epigenetic programming is implicated in specifying the fate of NSCs, in particular, in the silencing of genes that encode for alternative cell fates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Namihira1">[5]</xref>. Polycomb group (PcG) proteins have emerged as central players in such repressive epigenetic programming events.</p>
      <p>PcG proteins were originally identified in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>) as factors necessary to preserve cell-fate decisions throughout embryogenesis by silencing <italic>Hox</italic> genes in a body-segment-specific manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Kennison1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Schwartz1">[7]</xref>. PcG proteins are transcriptional repressors that function by modulating and altering higher-order chromatin structure at the site of their target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Schwartz2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Sparmann1">[9]</xref>. Hundreds of genes are silenced by polycomb proteins, including dozens of genes that encode crucial developmental regulators in organisms ranging from plants to human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Simon1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>PcG proteins are structurally and functionally diverse and form large multimeric complexes of two general types: Polycomb repressive complex-1 (PRC1) and -2 (PRC2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Ringrose1">[11]</xref>. Biochemical purification of PRC1 from mammalian cells has revealed the presence of a number of subunits including BMI1/MEL18, RING1A/RING1B/RNF2, hPC 1–3, hPH1–3, and YY1, among others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Levine1">[12]</xref>. PRC2 contains Eed, Suz12, and the methyltransferase Ezh2 that catalyzes histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Cao1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Shen1">[14]</xref>. Both Suz12 and Eed are required for complex stability and for the methyltransferase activity of the Ezh2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Pasini1">[15]</xref>. A common contention of the current models is that PRC2 initiates transcriptional repression, whereas PRC1 maintains the repressive state. Ezh2 mediated H3K27 methylation is required for the function of PRC1 and ultimate target gene silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Cao2">[16]</xref>. Ezh2-mediated transcriptional silencing depends upon its evolutionarily conserved catalytic SET domain, which imparts histone methyltransferase activity to the complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Cao1">[13]</xref>. Functional mutations in the components of PRCs eradicate the aptitude of embryonic stem (ES) cells to be pluripotent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Surani1">[17]</xref>. Indeed, genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies and other approaches have greatly expanded our knowledge of the PRCs and it has become evident that transcription factors and signaling components with key roles in cell fate decisions are the most frequent PRC2 targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Simon2">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Ezh2, the pivotal catalytic component of PRC2, has received considerable attention during recent years. In accordance with the suggested function of PRC2 in maintaining ES pluripotency and ES self-renewal, Ezh2 is highly expressed in ES cells and down regulated during differentiation towards somatic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-OCarroll1">[19]</xref>. Using a conditional knockout strategy, Ezh2 was also shown to be required for H3K27me3 formation in pluripotent epiblast cells that ultimately give rise to derivatives of the three germ layers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Erhardt1">[20]</xref>. In addition to its role in early embryonic development, Ezh2 has also been implicated in regulating the maintenance and self-renewal of multipotent tissue-specific stem cells, such as muscle cell stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Caretti1">[21]</xref>, hematopoietic stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Kamminga1">[22]</xref>, and epidermal stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Ezhkova1">[23]</xref> and by that controlling proceeding into differentiation.</p>
      <p>Previously, we have demonstrated the expression of Ezh2 in NSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Sher1">[24]</xref>. Its expression in undifferentiated NSCs and subsequent downregulation during the differentiation into neurons or astrocytes, suggested a role of Ezh2 in the maintenance and self-renewal of these multipotent stem cells. Indeed, we have shown that forced expression of Ezh2 in astrocytes induced their dedifferentiation into NSC-like cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Sher2">[25]</xref>. Moreover, recent papers have elucidated the involvement of Ezh2 and the PRC2 complex in the control of neuronal and astrocytic differentiation during neocortical development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Hirabayashi2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Pereira1">[27]</xref>. Surprisingly, Ezh2 remained highly expressed in NSCs that differentiated toward the oligodendrocytic cell lineage. Ezh2 expression was present in the early proliferating oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) up to the stage of premyelinating oligodendrocytes (pOLs). In mature, myelinating oligodendrocytes Ezh2 expression was no longer detectable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Sher1">[24]</xref>. The differentiation stages of OPCs are most strikingly characterized by derepression, i.e. silencing of repressors of oligodendrocyte cell lineage genes and myelination genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Liu1">[28]</xref>. In view of its known repressor functions, Ezh2 may play a role in the repressive epigenetic mechanisms during oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation.</p>
      <p>In order to further investigate the role of Ezh2 in undifferentiated NSCs and in the differentiation of oligodendrocytes, we have used chromatin immunoprecipitation and massive parallel sequencing (Chip-Seq: high-throughput sequencing) to map the Ezh2 target genes in NSCs and those in pOLs. In addition, we aimed to present further evidence for the relevance of Ezh2 expression in pOLs <italic>in vivo</italic>, during de- and remyelination in the cuprizone mouse model.</p>

          <title>Primary mouse neural stem cell culture</title>
          <p>Neural stem cells (NSCs) were isolated from the telencephalon of C57/BL6 mouse embryos at embryonic day 14 (E14). Cells were cultured in T25 (Nunc, Roskilde) tissue culture flasks containing proliferation medium, consisting of Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27, human recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF; 20 ng/ml), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; 20 ng/ml), 1% GlutaMAX (Invitrogen) Primocin (100 micrograms/ml; Lonza), and heparin (5 micrograms/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) in a humidified 5% CO2/95% air incubator at 37°C. Within 3–5 days, the cells grew as free-floating neurospheres. NSC differentiation was induced by withdrawing growth factors (EGF &amp; bFGF) and heparin from the proliferation medium.</p>

          <title>Primary murine oligodendrocyte cultures</title>
          <p>Mixed glial cultures were established from the brains of postnatal C57/BL6 pups in T75 cm<sup>2</sup> tissue culture flasks containing Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 10% FCS. After 10–14 days <italic>in vitro</italic>, the mixed glial cultures were placed on an orbital shaker (150 rpm) at 37°C for one to two hours, after which the detached microglia were removed from the supernatant. To obtain oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), cultures were placed on a shaker again (240 rpm) overnight at 37°C. On the following day, the supernatants were centrifuged and the pellets were resuspended in culture medium and plated on uncoated culture dishes for 30 minutes at 37°C. Microglia and astrocytes attached to the bottom of the culture dish, whereas oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) remained floating. In consecutive panning steps the floating cells were transferred from one culture dish to another until a pure (90–95%) OPC culture was obtained. The primary OPCs were cultured in standard SATO medium. During the first 2 days of culture, SATO medium was supplemented with Sonic hedgehog (100 ng/ml; R&amp;D Systems) platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-α (10 ng/ml; R&amp;D Systems) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; 20 ng/ml). During subsequent culturing, the OPCs differentiated and maturated along standard stages. At the pOLs stage (RIP-positive) the cells were used for chromatin immunoprecipitation.</p>

        <title>Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)</title>
        <p>We followed Upstate’s method for chromatin immunoprecipitation with minor adaptations. Mouse primary NSCs and pOLs were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 minutes, lysed in lysis buffer (5 mM PIPES, 85 mM KCl, 0.5% NP-40; Sigma), followed by nuclear lysis buffer (50 mM TRIS, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS). Chromatin was fragmented (500–700 bp) using a sonicator (Sonics Vibracell). Fragmented chromatin was precleared with protein A agarose/salmon sperm DNA (Millipore). Precleared chromatin was incubated overnight at 4°C with 5 micrograms of anti-Ezh2 antibody (Diagenode pAB-039-100) and isotype control (IgG). The next day, protein A agarose/salmon sperm DNA was added and samples were rotated for 2 hours at 4°C. Resultant immune complexes were washed once with low salt buffer (150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM TRIS), once with high salt buffer (500 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM TRIS), once with LiCl buffer (0.25 M LiCl,1% NP-40, 1% Na-deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM TRIS) and twice with TE buffer. The immune complexes were eluted by adding twice 250 ul of freshly prepared elution buffer (0.1 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1% SDS). The DNA protein cross-links were reversed by heating with 200 mM sodium chloride, the proteins were removed by treatment with proteinase K and DNA was precipitated using the phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol method.</p>
        <p>Within each ChIP experiment, a negative control ChIP was performed using 5 micrograms of polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin (IgG). To verify the ChIP conditions, a qPCR was performed on enriched DNA using promoter primers against Cdkn2a a known target of polycomb group proteins. The enrichment of immunoprecipitated DNA with anti-Ezh2 antibody versus negative control (IgG control) was calculated with following formula: FC  = 2∧(ddCT), FC.error  =  ln(2) * ddSD * FC. (FC  =  fold change, CT  =  cycle threshold, SD  =  standard deviation and d stands for delta). Multiple enriched samples were pooled and used for high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) on the Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx. The primer sets used for the ChIP experiments can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040399.s007">Table S2</xref>.</p>

        <p>The enriched and IgG control DNA was processed for analysis on the Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx using the Illumina ChIP-Seq sample preparation kit (IP-102-1001). Following the instructions on kit ‘A’, bases were added to the 3′ end of the DNA fragments and the fragments were ligated to Adapters. Subsequently, the Adapter-Modified DNA fragments were run on a 2% agarose gel to generate the DNA libraries based on fragments length (200±25 bp). Finally the Adapter-Modified DNA fragment libraries were enriched by PCR. After validating (quality control) the libraries by the Bioanalyzer, the sequencing reactions were performed with standard system components and reagents.</p>
        <p>The sequence reads were analyzed using Galaxy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Goecks1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Blankenberg1">[30]</xref>, a web based platform for computational and biomedical research. We obtained approximately 12.9 million reads from ChIP-Seq-NSCs, and 11.5 million from ChIP-Seq-pOLs samples. Before mapping, the quality control checks on raw sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing pipelines were performed using FastQC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.bbsrc.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.bioinformatics.bbsrc.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>), a quality control tool for high throughput sequence data (complete FastQC reports on all data sets can be seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040399.s013">Information S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040399.s014">Information S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040399.s015">Information S6</xref>). Illumina 1.9 reads were converted to Sanger format by running the tool FASTQ Groomer. The reads with a quality score &lt;10 were filtered out using the Filter FASTQ tool. The reads were also trimmed (16 bp from 3′ end) using FASTQ Trimmer tools. FASTQ data tools <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Blankenberg2">[31]</xref> were used from the Metaserver of Galaxy (for detail see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040399.s009">Table S4</xref> and FASTQC reports (pdf) for all three sequence files in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040399.s013">Information S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040399.s014">Information S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040399.s015">Information S6</xref>).

For the gene annotations, we used peak to gene script from the Galaxy/Cistrome. To avoid redundancies we performed visual inspection of each annotated gene peak detected by MACS on UCSC Genome Browser using BAM and BigWig tracks of ChIP-Seq-Ezh2 and ChIP-Seq-IgG (comparison of actual detected reads ChIP and IgG control). Some peaks identified by MACS occurred in a region where no substantial difference between the IgG control and ChIP could be observed. We concluded such peaks as false positives and they were ignored while preparing the final list (for details see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040399.s010">Information S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040399.s005">Figure S5</xref>).

        <title>ShRNA Knockdown of Ezh2 in NSCs and pOLs</title>
        <p>Ezh2 expression in NSCs and pOLs was silenced by using Ezh2 short hairpin RNA (Ezh2-shRNA) plasmid DNA construct targeting the coding region of the Ezh2 gene transcript (MISSION DNA NM 007971; Sigma-Aldrich). Five vectors (targeting different sequences in the coding region of Ezh2 transcript) for Ezh2 silencing were tested, of which two appeared to be similarly efficient in reducing Ezh2 expression (for details about these 2 Ezh2 shRNA, encoded sh-4 and sh-5, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040399.s010">Information S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040399.s001">Figure S1B and C </xref>and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040399.s004">Figure S4</xref>). The effects of Ezh2 silencing on NSCs and pOLs as described in the Results section were all obtained with one of the 2 efficient Ezh2shRNAs (sh-4); to exclude the possibility that they could be due to some off-target effects, we repeated some of the silencing experiments with the other efficient Ezh2 shRNA, sh-5, targeting other sequences in the coding region of the Ezh2 gene and depicted the results in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040399.s001">Figure S1</xref>and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040399.s002">Figure S2</xref>.

For control transfections, the same vector (pLKO.1-puro) (containing the sequence that does not target any mouse/human gene (nc-shRNA)) was used. After transfection, the cells were kept for 24 hours in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub>-95% air incubator at 37°C in proliferation medium (NSCs) and Sato medium (pOLs). The transfection efficiency of this procedure amounted to 60–80% and resulted in the transient expression of the transfected gene lasting up to 10–12 days. Ezh2 repression after 24 hours of transfection was established at the RNA level (with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [qRT-PCR]) and at protein level (with Western blotting).</p>

        <title>Genome Wide Identification of Target Genes of Ezh2 in NSCs and pOLs</title>
        <p>To unravel the function of Ezh2 in NSCs and in premature oligodendrocytes (pOLs), we identified the target genes of Ezh2 in both cell types by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using anti-Ezh2 antibodies, followed by ultra high-throughput massive parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq). We used the Illumina<sup>R</sup> sequencing technology for ultra high-throughput sequencing of enriched genomic DNA (IP with anti-Ezh2) and of background noise genomic DNA (IP with isotype control IgG) in both cell types. Using the metaserver of Galaxy, a web-based platform for genome analysis, we mapped the sequence files with the reference mouse genome (mm9). To identify peaks, we used the Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) tool from the Galaxy/Cistrome metaserver. We extracted significant ChIP peaks after normalizing with background noise (IgG control). To obtain the annotations for genes we used the “peak2gene” script from the Galaxy/Cistrome. All annotated gene peaks detected by MACS in both cell types were visually inspected in the UCSC genome browser by loading BAM/BigWig tracks of ChIP-Seq-Ezh2 and ChIP-Seq-IgG control. The peaks detected by MACS that showed no considerable difference between ChIP-Seq-Ezh2 and ChIP-Seq-IgG signal (with respect to number of reads) at the UCSC genome browser, were rejected. Finally, we filtered 1532 annotated gene peaks in NSCs and 393 in pOLs respectively as targets of Ezh2. All of the 393 genes in pOLs were also target in the NSCs. The complete lists of target genes in both cell types are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040399.s011">information S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040399.s012">information S3</xref>.

The algorithm found that less than 5% of the input genomic regions from both cell types was not putatively associated with any gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040399-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). In both NSCs and pOLs most of the input genomic regions were found to be associated with one or two genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040399-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>).

        <p>The pattern of Ezh2 gene occupancy during the differentiation of NSCs suggests that Ezh2 keeps on repressing a number of genes when cells enter the oligodendrocytic cell lineage. As extensively described before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Sher1">[24]</xref>, no Ezh2 expression (at mRNA or protein level) and so no Ezh2 target genes could be found and pulled down with ChIP in freshly differentiated neurons or astrocytes (data not shown).</p>
        <p>In order to reveal general functional characteristics of the molecular programs involving Ezh2, we first conducted a gene ontology analysis on the target gene lists of NSCs and pOLs using the online tool Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) v6.7. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040399-g001">Figures 1C and D</xref>). In NSCs, we found that Ezh2 targeted genes mainly associated with gene ontology terms like Developmental processes, mRNA transcription regulation, Neurogenesis, Cell proliferation and differentiation and Cell cycle control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040399-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In pOLs the major significantly enriched gene ontology terms were also Developmental processes, mRNA transcription regulation and Neurogenesis but besides these, terms that refer to neuronal specification and neuronal fate commitment were also significantly enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040399-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
        <p>Further insight in the function of the Ezh2 target genes in NSCs and in pOLs was obtained using DAVID tools that visualize genes on BioCarta &amp; KEGG pathways and allow identification of the top canonical signaling, disease and metabolic pathways represented by the genes that are significantly enriched in a given cell type. We observed 7 significantly enriched pathways both in NSCs and pOLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040399-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Two pathways, i.e. the PDGF- and Shh-signaling pathway, were only apparent in NSCs, whereas the dopamine receptor mediated signaling pathway was only enriched in Ezh2 targets in pOLs.</p>
        <p>Further analysis of the Ezh2 target genes coming up from the ChIP-Seq tracks in the UCSC genome browser view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040399-g002">Figure 2</xref>) revealed that in NSCs, genes are targeted which are involved in differentiation to each of the 3 neural cell types, i.e. oligodendrocytic lineage specific genes (e.g. <italic>Olig2, Olig3, Pdgfra, Nkx2.2</italic> and <italic>6.2</italic>), neuronal lineage specific genes (e.g. <italic>NeuroD2</italic>, <italic>Tlx3</italic> and <italic>Phonx2b</italic>) and astrocytic lineage specific genes (e.g. <italic>Tal1</italic>, also known as <italic>Scl</italic>). In pOLs, the oligodendrogenic lineage specific genes are no longer targeted by Ezh2, whereas the astrocytic and neuronal lineage specific genes still are. The Ezh2 targeted neuronal lineage genes not only include genes encoding general neuronal properties, but also genes involved in the differentiation of a more specific neuronal cell type. For instance, <italic>Nurr1</italic>, <italic>Lmx1a/1b, En1/2, Otx2, Pitx3</italic> and <italic>Isl1</italic> and <italic>Isl2</italic> are all Ezh2 target genes involved in dopaminergic neuron and motor neuron differentiation, respectively.</p>

        <title>Acute Suppression of Ezh2 in NSCs</title>
        <p>To determine the significance of Ezh2 activity for NSCs maintenance and self-renewal, we followed Ezh2-shRNA transfected NSCs up to three days in culture as they developed into neurospheres during their clonal expansion. We observed dramatic changes in neurosphere morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040399-g004">Figure 4A</xref>): Ezh2 silenced neurospheres were smaller, more flattened and contained many dying cells in comparison to controls as revealed by propidium iodide staining. Immunostaining for the proliferation marker Ki67 revealed a strong reduction of proliferation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040399-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>). Cleaved caspase 3 immunostaining confirmed the increase in apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040399-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>). These effects of Ezh2-shRNA on NSCs were further confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-PCNA (another proliferation marker) and anti-cleaved caspase 3 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040399-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). The results of these silencing experiments further substantiate the idea that Ezh2 mediated gene repression in NSCs is essential for maintenance (i.e. suppressing differentiation) and survival of NSCs and for controlling proliferation and cell cycle as has been shown before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Sher1">[24]</xref>. The results of acute Ezh2 silencing on NSC morphology and apoptosis as described above were obtained with one of the Ezh2shRNAs (sh-4); to exclude the possibility that they could be due to some off-target effects, we repeated these silencing experiments with the other efficient Ezh2 shRNA (sh-5, targeting other sequences in the coding region of the Ezh2 gene) and found similar results, depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040399.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040399.s002">Figure S2</xref>.

        <title>Acute Suppression of Ezh2 in pOLs</title>
        <p>Similar to NSCs, we investigated the significance of Ezh2-mediated gene repression for the maintenance and survival of pOLs. To that purpose we reduced Ezh2 expression by Ezh2-shRNA silencing in A2B5-positive pOLs enriched cultures (∼90%). pOLs treated with Ezh2-shRNA rapidly (within 24 hours) developed an abnormal morphology: they retracted their extensions, lost RIP immunostaining, and underwent apoptosis as indicated by high levels of cleaved caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040399-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The results of Ezh2 silencing on pOL morphology and apoptosis as described above were obtained with one of the Ezh2shRNAs (sh-4); to exclude the possibility that they could be due to some off-target effects, we repeated the silencing experiments with the other efficient Ezh2 shRNA (sh-5, targeting other sequences in the coding region of the Ezh2 gene) and found similar results, depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040399.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040399.s002">Figure S2</xref>. The ChIP-Seq data analysis revealed that pOLs have specific sets of genes responsible for neuronal and astrogenic cell lineage as Ezh2 target genes in common with NSCs. Indeed, most of these genes became upregulated after knocking down the expression of Ezh2 (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040399-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) and their appearance in the differentiated pOLs must have resulted in prominent cell stress. Besides that, just like in NSCs, also in pOLs, cell cycle arrest and cell death genes like <italic>Cdkn2a, Tcf21</italic> are Ezh2 target genes, and their re-expression (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040399-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) after Ezh2 silencing may have caused apoptosis in a similar way as in the NSCs.</p>

        <title>Expression of Ezh2 in NSCs and pOLs in the Mouse Brain</title>
        <p>To further confirm the relevance of Ezh2 expression in NSCs and during their differentiation into oligodendrocytic cell lineage, we extended our previous <italic>in vitro</italic> observations to an <italic>in vivo</italic> model. We performed Ezh2-immunostaining on adult mouse brain sections containing the subventricular zone. NSCs in this zone appeared to be specifically stained for Ezh2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040399-g007">Figure 7A, and 7B–7B</xref>”’). Ezh2-immunostaining of the adjacent corpus callosum revealed only sporadically Ezh2 staining in a few oligodendrocyte precursor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040399-g007">Figure 7A and 7C–C</xref>”’) while adult oligodendrocytes did not express Ezh2. Exposing mice to a diet containing 0.2% cuprizone for five weeks results in oligodendrocyte death and demyelination in the corpus callosum. In reaction to this demyelination, OPCs from neighboring areas invade the corpus callosum and proliferate. Restoring normal diet after this period even further stimulates OPCs recruitment, evoking remyelination activity of the corpus callosum within two weeks. Immunostaining revealed the high expression of Ezh2 in the OPCs in the corpus callosum after five weeks on diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040399-g007">Figure 7D, 7E–E</xref>”’ and 7H) as well as after two weeks after restoring normal diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040399-g007">Figure 7D, 7F–F</xref>”’ and 7H).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Previously, we have shown that the PcG protein Ezh2 is prominently expressed in NSCs and in premyelinating oligodendrocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Sher1">[24]</xref>. We now have extended these observations with <italic>in vivo</italic> data on the expression of Ezh2 in adult NSCs and most prominently in OPCs, recruited for remyelination in adult mice put on a 0.2% cuprizone diet. Our ChIP-Seq analysis revealed 1532 genes targeted by Ezh2 in NSCs of which 393 remained an Ezh2 target in OPCs up to the stage of becoming a myelin-forming oligodendrocyte. The Ezh2-silencing experiments present evidence for the involvement of Ezh2 in proliferation and self-renewal in NSCs by specifically targeting genes involved in cell death, cellular compromise, and cell cycle arrest (e.g. p16 pathway) and sets of genes involved in NSC differentiation. Genes that remain targeted by Ezh2 in pOLs appear to be partly associated with cell death signaling and prominently with neuronal and astrocytic lineage determination.</p>
      <p>The target genes of Ezh2 that we found in NSCs as well as in pOLs substantially overlap with most of the polycomb target genes conserved in embryonic stem cells (ES cells) in flies and vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Bracken1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Ringrose2">[44]</xref>. The repression of these target genes (which include most of the Hox genes) are all considered essential for the maintenance of a pluripotent state. Our findings suggest that the same genes are required for maintaining multipotency and seem to imply that the oligodendrocyte precursor cells may not be considered merely unipotent, but still have a multipotent signature. Indeed the studies by Kondo et al. have shown that OPCs can be easily reprogrammed into NSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Kondo1">[45]</xref>. Such a continuing multipotent signature during differentiation apparently does not exist during the differentiation of NSCs into neurons or astrocytes, where there is an abrupt transition from NSC to differentiated cell accompanied by an absolute downregulation of Ezh2. Forced expression of Ezh2 in astrocytes seems to be a prerequisite to induce their dedifferentiation back to NSC-like cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Sher2">[25]</xref>. The gradual stage-dependent decrease in Ezh2 expression during oligodendrocyte differentiation seems to be in line with the emerging view that PcG protein complexes dynamically regulate the gene hierarchy during cell fate choice up to different levels of differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Schuettengruber1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Chou1">[47]</xref>. Our findings in the OPCs are also in line with studies on the role of Ezh2 in other tissue-specific multipotent stem cells, for instance in the skin: Ezh2-expressing basal progenitor cells in the skin give rise to several epidermal cell types and by controlling spatial and temporal epigenetic modifications Ezh2 orchestrates gene expression during the differentiation into epidermis-specific cell types in a stepwise fashion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Ezhkova1">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Derepression of oligodendrogenic genes, while continuing the Ezh2-mediated repression of neuronal and astrocytic lineage genes, appears to be a major step in the differentiation of NSCs towards an oligodendrocytic cell lineage. Apparently, such a strategy is not followed during the differentiation into neurons or astrocytes, when both astrogenic and neurogenic genes are no longer Ezh2 target genes. Other epigenetic regulatory mechanisms may be involved: for instance, it is possible that in these cell types the homolog of Ezh2, Ezh1, may take over and execute the trimethylation of H3K27 of the relevant target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Shen2">[48]</xref>. Otherwise, the role of REST, a major regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation, may interfere and modify the epigenetic mechanisms in differentiating neurons and astrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-DeWald1">[49]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In our studies, Ezh2 knockdown resulted in a profound decrease in NSC proliferation and an increase in cell death. We conclude that Ezh2 is critical for normal NSC survival and self-renewal. This is in line with previous studies linking Ezh2 to cell survival and proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Kamminga1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Bello1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Suva1">[51]</xref>. We identified several target genes of Ezh2, like <italic>Cdkn2a</italic>, <italic>Tcf21</italic>, and <italic>Six1</italic>, which are all involved in cell cycle control, cell death and cellular compromise. We found a strong increase in the p16 protein encoded by <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> after Ezh2 silencing. P16 acts as a negative regulator of proliferation of normal cells by interacting with CDK4 and CDK6. This inhibits their ability to interact with cyclin D and to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein and so to maintain a stable Rb-E2F complex, which represses cell cycle progression. Our data suggest that Ezh2 silencing leads to derepression of p16 transcription and subsequent promotion of cell cycle exit. It would be interesting to check whether p16 silencing can rescue the phenotype instigated by Ezh2-shRNA. To this purpose, the use of Ezh2-conditional knockout mice would be optimal. Other target genes of Ezh2 likely involved in its control of proliferation and survival of NSCs are <italic>Gdf6</italic> and <italic>Gdf7</italic> - subfamily members of the TGF-beta superfamily, which when derepressed activate TGF-beta signaling. TGF-beta signaling is involved in various physiological and pathophysiological processes of the brain. It appears to be induced in the adult brain after injury or hypoxia and during neurodegeneration when it modulates and dampens inflammatory responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Aigner1">[41]</xref>. TGF-beta signaling has been thought to limit the self-repair of the brain by inhibiting neural stem cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Aigner1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Golestaneh1">[52]</xref>. Moreover, <italic>in vitro</italic> assays have shown that TGF-beta signaling activation resulted in a strong suppression of NSCs proliferation and self-renewal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Wachs1">[42]</xref>. The identification of <italic>Gdf6</italic> and <italic>Gdf7</italic> as Ezh2 target genes has implicated TGF-beta signaling for the first time in the Ezh2 controlled regulation of NSC proliferation and survival. Likewise, the Ezh2 silencing experiments in pOLs showed a similar critical role of Ezh2 in survival. Similar mechanisms as described above for NSCs may be involved. In addition, it is clear that the forced expression of genes encoding for other neural cell types in a cell already committed to an oligodendrocytic cell lineage may amount to considerable cell stress resulting in apoptosis.</p>
      <p>So far, we assumed that Ezh2 exerts the same effect in NSCs and in pOLs. The actual activity of Ezh2 is determined by the composition of the PRC2 complex and this composition may vary in different cell types. Previous studies have shown that, in general, the core components of PRC2 are interdependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Pasini1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Boyer1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040399-Montgomery1">[53]</xref> and indeed in a first experiment in our lab we have shown that the core components of PRC2 (Ezh2, Suz12 and EED) were present in both NSCs and pOLs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040399.s003">Figure S3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040399.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). However, in pOLs we detected the presence of an additional isoform of Suz12, possibly a sumoylated modification of this component (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040399.s003">Figure S3C</xref>), which may affect PRC2 activity and the resulting recruitment of PRC1 influencing the transcription of one or more genes in a differential way. In future research, the specific regulation of the expression of each of the Ezh2 target genes should be addressed to understand in detail the role of PcG epigenetic regulation in oligodendrocyte differentiation.</p>

The CCGG is left over from the AgeI site and this site is lost during the cloning. The CTCGAG is the “loop” sequence. The TTTTT is the Polymerase III stop sequence. The 3′ G, if present, indicates an intact EcoRI site. The Ezh2-shRNA clone has EcoRI still intact. The sense hairpin sequence (RNAi sequence) is in red and antisense is in purple.</p>

However, while the regions near or in the promoter of the <italic>Lhx1, Igf2bp1</italic> show considerable high ChIP signal (high number of reads) in ChIP-Seq-Ezh2 versus ChIP-Seq-IgG control track, such difference did not exist in or near the promoter of GiP (large arrow). Therefore GiP peak was concluded as false positive. Directions of small arrows indicate orientation of the transcription.</p>
