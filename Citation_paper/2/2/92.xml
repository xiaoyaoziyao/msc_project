<abstract>
<p><italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> is a Gram-negative oral anaerobe associated with infection of the periodontia. The organism has a small number of two-component signal transduction systems, and after comparing genome sequences of strains W83 and ATCC 33277 we discovered that the latter was mutant in histidine kinase (PGN_0752), while the cognate response regulator (PGN_0753) remained intact. Microarray-based transcriptional profiling and ChIP-seq assays were carried out with an ATCC 33277 transconjugant containing the functional histidine kinase from strain W83 (PG0719). The data showed that the regulon of this signal transduction system contained genes that were involved in hemin acquisition, including gingipains, at least three transport systems, as well as being self-regulated. Direct regulation by the response regulator was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In addition, the system appears to be activated by hemin and the regulator acts as both an activator and repressor.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis,</italic> a black-pigmented Gram-negative oral anaerobe, is a member of the oral microbiota. Although it is found in subgingival plaque of periodontally healthy individuals, this opportunistic pathogen is present in higher numbers in subjects with chronic periodontitis. <italic>P.gingivalis</italic> cells must adjust their physiology in order to survive the multiple challenges of the infectious process such as host defense products and metabolites produced by other microorganisms in the gingival biofilm. The ability to respond to such environmental changes is in part regulated by two component systems (TCS) that comprise a sensor histidine kinase (HK) and a response regulator (RR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-Stock1">[1]</xref>. Triggered by an environmental cue the HK autophosphorylates a conserved histidine within its sensor domain. The high-energy phosphate is then transferred to a conserved aspartate within the receiver domain of the cognate RR. The activated RR then binds to the promoter of a target gene to either induce or repress gene expression.</p>
<p>The genomes of <italic>P.gingivalis</italic> ATCC 33277, the type strain, and W83, a clinical isolate, contain four HK/RR pairs, one orphan HK, two orphan RR, and one HK-RR chimeric protein (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Complete_Genomes/SignalCensus.html,11" xlink:type="simple">http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Complete_Genomes/SignalCensus.html,11</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cmr.tigr.org/tigr-scripts/CMR/CmrHomePage.cgi" xlink:type="simple">http://cmr.tigr.org/tigr-scripts/CMR/CmrHomePage.cgi</ext-link>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-Nelson1">[2]</xref>. In strain W83, PG0719 (HK)-PG0720 (RR) [TIGR annotation] comprise a classical TCS, encoding 50 and 25 kDa proteins, respectively. Comparison of the genomes of strains W83 genome and TDC60 with that of ATCC 33277 revealed a 2.5 kb deletion in the latter in the region homologous to PG0719-0720. As a result, the HK of ATCC 33277 (PGN_0752) [NCBI annotation] appears to be rendered non-functional, and while the RR (PGN_0753) is structurally intact its expression could not be detected.</p>
<p>We used a combination of genetics, transcript expression profiling, and DNA-protein binding assays to identify components of the PGN_0753 regulon in <italic>P.gingivalis</italic> ATCC 33277. Among the candidate genes identified we focused on those involved in acquisition and transport of iron/hemin into cells, and named the system HaeSR (for <bold>hae</bold>min). Iron is an essential nutrient for survival of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>, and the majority of iron found in the human body is stored in hemoglobin as heme (iron complexed with protoporphyrin IX). <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> has a number of mechanisms for sequestering heme from hemoglobin and other host proteins such as degradation and heme binding by gingipains, and outer membrane receptors with high affinity for heme that is subsequently transported into the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-Lewis1">[3]</xref>. We found that HaeSR directly regulated several uptake systems as well as expression of gingipain cysteine proteinases that degrade hemoglobin to release and bind heme. The present study indicates that the HaeSR system plays a significant role in regulating these processes.</p>

<p>Strain W83 was grown on BAP, and ATCC 33277/pTCOW (empty vector control) and TR719 on BAP containing tetracycline, for 48 h at 37¬∞C under anaerobic conditions. From BAP, strains were cultured in TSB containing 2 ¬µg/ml hemin and 1 ¬µg/ml menadione, and harvested at mid- logarithmic growth phase (OD<sub>550 nm</sub> 0.5). Total RNA was extracted using the <italic>mir</italic>Vana RNA Isolation Kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. Contaminating genomic DNA was removed by digestion with Turbo RNase-free DNase I (Ambion) followed by sodium acetate precipitation. DNA contamination was assessed by PCR amplification of using 16S rRNA primers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0073351-t001">Table 1</xref>), and agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA concentration, purity and quality was determined using NanoDrop N-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies) and agarose gel electrophoresis.</p>
<p>An aliquot of RNA (1 ¬µg) was reverse transcribed to cDNA with random hexamer primers and RevertAid‚Ñ¢M-MuLV Reverse (Fermentas). Real-time PCR was carried out with an iCycler (Bio-Rad). Primers for specific genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0073351-t001">Table 1</xref>) were designed with Integrated DNA Technologies Bio Tools (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.idtdna.com/scitools/scitools.aspx" xlink:type="simple">http://www.idtdna.com/scitools/scitools.aspx</ext-link>). Optimization of PCR conditions for each specific primer pair (from Integrated DNA Technologies) was carried out with iQ SYBR green Supermix (Bio-Rad) to detect double-stranded DNA products. The expression of each gene was related to that of the 16S rRNA gene which was used as an internal reference. All reactions were carried out in triplicate. The real-time cycling conditions were: 95¬∞C for 7 min for the initial activation step, 50 cycles each of denaturing at 95¬∞C for 10 s, and annealing-extension at 57¬∞C for 15 s. To confirm that a single PCR product was amplified, melting curve analysis was performed with the following conditions: 95¬∞C for 1 min, 55¬∞C for 1 min, and 55 to 95¬∞C with a heating rate of 0.5¬∞C per 10 s. In addition, amplicons were fractioned on 2% agarose gels to confirm the predicted sizes. Fold-changes in gene expression between ATCC 33277 and TR719 were calculated by the Pfaffl equation, in which the expression ratio is represented as: (Etarget)ŒîCttarget(control‚Äìexperimental)/(E ref)ŒîCt ref(control ‚Äì experimental) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-Pfaffl1">[10]</xref>. The equation normalizes the expression of the gene of interest (target) and subtracts the expression of the 16S rRNA gene based on PCR efficiency (E) and threshold cycle (Ct), i.e., the cycle number at which exponential fluorescence is detectable. PCR efficiency is obtained from the equation 10<sup>‚àí1/slope</sup> and is a reliable factor for estimating the quality of the PCR product generated during exponential phase amplification of each gene in a template dilution series. The slope was automatically calculated by the iCycler from the logarithmic plot of the cycle number derived from 10-fold dilutions of a pool of cDNA samples. Theoretically, a slope of ‚àí3.3 indicates that the PCR efficiency is 100% or two-fold amplification per cycle.</p>

<title>Strain ATCC 33277 is Defective in PGN_0752 Histidine Kinase</title>
<p>Our attempts to construct RR or HK mutants in TCS PGN_0752-0753 of strain ATCC 33277 were unsuccessful. Furthermore, we were unable to isolate similar mutants in homologues PG0719-0720 from strain W83, and provisionally concluded that this TCS may be essential. Recently, we used a Mariner-based transposon mutagenesis system to generate mutant libraries in W83 and ATCC 33277 backgrounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-Klein1">[15]</xref>. Neither of these libraries contained mutants within the coding region of HK PG0719 or PGN_0752 nor the N-terminal portion of RR PG0720 and PGN_0753 which contains the RR receiver domain, signifying that these genes encoded essential functions. In a previous study we noted that the genomic region surrounding the PG0719-0720 TCS was highly divergent between strains W83 and ATCC 33277 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-Chen1">[16]</xref>. Following publication of the genome sequence of ATCC 33277 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-Naito1">[17]</xref> a close examination of this region revealed a 2.529 kbp deletion in ATCC 33277 at the locus homologous to TCS PG0719-720 of W83 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073351-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). As annotated by Naito et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-Naito1">[17]</xref>, RR PGN_0753 from ATCC 33277 is 19 amino acids longer than the W83 homologue due to a mutated stop codon and read through into the residual fragment of the HK gene (PGN_0752) until the next stop codon. The 39 amino acids of the HK internal coding sequence resulted from a return to translation up to the start of the deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073351-g001">Fig. 1B and C</xref>). The deletion removed the rest of the PGN_0752 HK gene including phosphorylation and DNA binding sites and also PG0718, a conserved hypothetical of variable size according to different annotation sources (Bioinformatics Resource for Oral Pathogens, (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.brop.org" xlink:type="simple">http://genome.brop.org</ext-link>). In addition, most of the PG0717 (W83) homologue was deleted except for the sequence encoding the 30 C-terminal amino acids which is fused to the 38 amino acid fragment of HK PGN_0752 and shown as the italicized sequence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073351-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>.</p>

<p>To confirm that the HaeRS TCS was not functional in ATCC 33277 we compared expression of the HK and RR transcripts with those from W83 by QRT-PCR and RR protein production by Western. Clearly, in strain ATCC 33277 expression of the HK transcript was barely detectable and that of the RR transcript was approximately five-fold less than in W83 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073351-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). These data were confirmed by Western blot where RR production by ATCC 33277 could not be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073351-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). We constructed a transconjugate strain (TR719) of ATCC 33277 that carried the functional HK (PG0719) from W83 on pT-COW and tested whether production of RR PGN_0753 was restored. By Western (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073351-g002">Fig. 2</xref> C lane 2), we observed that the presence of functional HK PG0719 (W83) restores expression of RR PGN_0753 in the transconjugant.</p>

<p>Nine genes were down-regulated in TR719 in all three conditions, and two of the genes encode hypothetical proteins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0073351-t003">Table 3</xref>). One down-regulated gene of interest is PGN_0460 which encodes a histone-like family DNA-binding protein. A second is PGN_1474 encoding S-ribosylhomocysteinase, a member of the LuxS superfamily. We confirmed by QRT-PCR that <italic>luxS</italic> expression is decreased between 13% and 45% under all hemin conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073351-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Under hemin-depleted and -limited conditions several important genes involved in heme/iron acquisition are down-regulated, e.g. <italic>hagA</italic> (PGN_1733) and <italic>rgpA</italic> (PGN_1970). As demonstrated by QRT-PCR, under all hemin conditions there was either decreased or equal expression of <italic>hagA</italic>. Since strain ATCC is functionally mutant in the HaeSR TCS, we reasoned that the differentially regulated genes described above were potential components of its regulon.</p>

<title>Identification of HaeR - DNA Binding Regions by ChIP-seq</title>
<p>Cultures were grown under three hemin concentrations (0.0, 0.001, and 2 ¬µg/ml). Complexes of ATCC 33277 genomic DNA and HaeR that formed <italic>in vivo</italic> were precipitated with antibody to rHaeR cloned from strain W83 (PG0720). The regions of DNA complexed with HaeR were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform giving directional reads of approximately 20‚Äì25 bp that were aligned to the genome of ATCC 33277. The reads for the three conditions were normalized to the IgG control then the genome was scanned for regions enriched in the ChIP sequence pool. Our primary goal was to identify new promoter regions bound by HaeR, therefore, we focused on sequences that were located within the putative promoter region of a gene rather than within genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0073351-t004">Table 4</xref>). For inclusion, the reads had to be sequenced in the direction of the start of the gene and no more than 400 bp in front of the gene. Alternatively, the read could be directed outward from the start of the gene and within the first 75‚Äì100 bp of the gene. The hits nested within genes are the focus of a future investigation. HaeR binding sites were found in front of 57 genes, and in most cases binding occurred in all three hemin conditions. Seventeen of the genes with HaeR sites were associated with transport, e.g. TonB-dependent receptors and transporters and ABC transporters. The next largest class of genes encoded hypothetical proteins among which were several putative inner and outer membrane proteins with possible roles in transport. Of note was a class of genes significant for roles in iron transport and/or virulence, e.g. gingipains and hemagglutinins.</p>

<title>Direct Regulation of Genes by HaeR Confirmed by EMSA</title>
<p>Electromobility shift assays were used to confirm a role for HaeR in the direct regulation of genes involved in hemin transport, gingipain production, and others revealed by microarray and ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073351-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Promoter sequences of approximately 200‚Äì300 bp were generated by PCR from strain ATCC 33277 genomic DNA using primers designed from regions 5‚Ä≤ to each ORF (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0073351-t001">Table 1</xref>). Increasing concentrations of recombinant His<sub>6</sub>-PGN_0753 (3.5, 40, and 112 pmole) were incubated with promoter sequences (0.8 pmole/¬µl). In each case addition of rPGN_0753 lead to retardation of the electrophoretic mobilities of the putative promoters of <italic>htrA</italic>, <italic>ihtA</italic>, and <italic>hmu</italic>Y; addition of excess probe ablated binding and hence retardation. In addition to <italic>hmu</italic>Y, PGN_0753 also bound and shifted a region 250 bp directly upstream of <italic>hmuS</italic>, the third gene in the <italic>hmu</italic>Y<italic>RSTUV</italic> operon that was identified as a potential target of HaeR by ChIP-seq. PGN_0753 did not bind to the promoter of <italic>nqrA</italic> (PG2182), a target of regulator RprY that was used as a negative control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-DuranPinedo1">[8]</xref>. In addition, we showed that HaeR bound to its own promoter as well as those of <italic>ragA</italic> (PGN_0293) which contains a TonB heme binding motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-Nagano1">[18]</xref>, and also to the promoters of PGN_1728 and PGN_1970, <italic>kgp</italic> and <italic>rgpA</italic>, respectively. Thus, HaeR appears to play a central role in the acquisition and transport of heme by <italic>P. gingivalis.</italic></p>

<p>In addition, PGN_0753 also binds to putative promoter regions of several genes that encode for signaling proteins, channels, and lipoproteins including PGN_1432, a putative outer membrane efflux protein; PGN_0809, a putative TonB-dependent receptor protein; PGN_1739, a putative lipoprotein; and PGN_1752, a putative ferredoxin 4Fe-4S protein, as well as the promoter region of a one- component protein, PGN_0102, which has, as yet, no known function.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The objective of this study was to define the role of the PGN_0752-PGN_0753 TCS (HaeRS) in the physiology of <italic>P.gingivalis</italic> strain ATCC 33277. When we compared loci of these systems in sequenced strains W83 and ATCC 33277 we noted a deletion in the latter that removed three ORFs upstream from, and most of the HK, PGN_0752 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073351-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Mariner transposon mutants were not obtained in this HK from either strain indicative of its essentiality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-Klein1">[15]</xref>. On the other hand, in both strains transposon mutants were obtained in the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of the RR. The regulators PG0720 and PGN_0753 have BLASTP matches (e-values &gt;1√ó10<sup>‚àí10</sup>) to 16 genes in the Database of Essential Genes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tubic.tju.cn/deg/" xlink:type="simple">http://tubic.tju.cn/deg/</ext-link>). These matches are exclusively to two-component systems and transcriptional regulators. The RRs of the HaeRS system were similar in both strains although the ATCC 33277 homologue, PGN_0753 was longer by 19 amino acids at the C-terminus as a mutated stop codon lead to read through of a protein fragment encoded in the residual HK DNA sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073351-g001">Fig. 1</xref> B). PG0719, the HK from strain W83, has three DEG matches (e-values &gt;1√ó10<sup>‚àí6</sup>) to the sensory box of the VicK histidine kinase of <italic>Staphlococcus aureus</italic>, the YycG histidine kinase of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, and the PhoR histidine kinase of <italic>Salmonella. typhimurium</italic>. PGN_0752, in the truncated form present in ATCC 33277 has no match in the DEG.</p>
<p>In the W83 genome, the DNA corresponding to the ATCC 33277 deletion encodes three hypothetical genes (Oralgen annotation, Los Alamos National Laboratory viewed at BROP) and interrogation of the non-redundant nucleotide database (NCBI) showed 100 and 99% identity only to <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> strains W83 and TDC60, respectively. According to the TIGR annotation (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073351-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), PG0716‚ÄìPG0718 are not present, at least in the same genomic region, in strain ATCC 33277. In fact, PG0716 is only annotated as a hypothetical protein-coding sequence in one (Oralgen) of four recognized annotations of the genome, and has neither a Pfam domain nor a DEG match. PG0718, annotated as a ‚Äúconserved hypothetical‚Äù protein has no homology to any ATCC 33277 or DEG genes. Obviously, PG0716 and PG0718 are not essential for growth of ATCC 33277 as no homology was found within the ATCC 33277 genome to these two ORFs. Annotated as a lipoprotein, PG0717 contains four domains of unknown function, Pfam DUF2874; to date, this domain is only found in anaerobic and microaerophilic bacterial species. PG0717 matches to a putatively essential gene in <italic>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</italic>. While a PG0717 homologue is not present in the genome of ATCC 33277, one copy of DUF2874 is reconstituted in the chimeric protein comprising the HK PGN_0752 internal fragment and the C-terminal fragment of the PG0717 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073351-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), raising the possibility that essentiality may be functionally complemented by this region. In ATCC 33277 the expression of both genes of the TCS was extremely low, and RR PGN_0753 could not be detected by Western blot, consistent with the transcription data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073351-g002">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Preliminary assays suggested an association of the TCS with hemin and/or iron transport. A hemin-dependent growth phenotype of the ATCC 33277 parent strain was confirmed by its decreased growth on hemin-replete, -restricted, and -depleted media compared to the transconjugant complemented with the functional HK (PG0719) from strain W83 which partially restored growth of ATCC 33277 under hemin-limiting conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073351-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). We used both transcription profiling and ChIP-seq to identify components of the HaeR regulon. Transcription profiling compared gene expression in ATCC 33277 and transconjugant TR719 during growth in hemin-depleted, -restricted, and -replete conditions and identified genes that were directly and indirectly regulated by HaeR. ChIP-seq was carried out with cultures of TR719 incubated under the same hemin conditions in order to identify DNA sequences that are recognized and bound by, and thus directly regulated by HaeR. A subset of genes identified in the microarrays were also identified by ChIP-seq, as were genes previously reported to respond to hemin depletion or excess, e.g. PGN_0687 (<italic>htrA</italic>), PGN_0688 (Ton B receptor), PGN_1728 and PGN_1970, <italic>rgpA</italic> and <italic>kgp</italic>, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-KiyamaKishikawa1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-Dashper1">[20]</xref>. Other genes consistently showed increased transcription under all hemin conditions but did not appear in the ChIP-seq sequences suggesting that they are indirectly regulated by HaeR, e.g. gene cluster PGN_0444-0449 that encoded efflux and ABC transporters. Another cluster (PGN_1343-1349) upregulated in all three hemin conditions also encoded ABC and TonB transporter components, however, associated non-coding sequences were detected by ChIP-seq and HaeR binding to promoter regions was established by EMSA.</p>
<p>Primarily, the ChIP-seq data indicated HaeR binding to specific promoter sequences, however, the number of copies of a promoter sequence in the ChIP-seq pool also increased or decreased in response hemin concentration reflecting expression of HaeR targets. For example, the number of pPGN_0753 (<italic>haeR</italic>) sequences in the pool increased from 7 to 68 copies in 0.0 and 2.0 ¬µg/ml hemin, respectively, which we interpreted as the result of an increase in RR activation. Increased activation correlated with increased expression since the QRT-PCR data showed that at 2 ¬µg/ml hemin expression of <italic>haeR</italic> increased 5 to 9- fold relative to the parental level (ATCC 33277 containing pTCOW empty vector), while at 0 ¬µg/ml hemin there is approximately a 2- fold increase in expression of <italic>haeR</italic>, so in this case hemin-activated HaeR appeared to act as a positive regulator. Conversely, expression of gingipain <italic>rgpA</italic> was down-regulated in the transconjugant in response to decreasing hemin, and by ChIP-seq there were more copies of the <italic>rgpA</italic> promoter in the absence of hemin, indicating that hemin-activated PGN_0753 acted as a negative regulator and repressed expression of <italic>rgpA</italic>. Similar results were obtained for the promoters of <italic>kgp</italic>, <italic>hagA</italic>, <italic>hagB</italic> and <italic>hagC</italic> implying that these genes were also induced in the absence of hemin.</p>
<p>In addition to the hemin-responsive pattern observed for the <italic>rgpA</italic> and <italic>haeR</italic> promoters, another was revealed for several promoters by comparing ChIP-seq and QRT-PCR and/or microarray data. The number of ChIP-seq hits for the promoter of PGN_1085 (ferrous iron transport protein B) had a positive correlation with increasing concentrations of hemin (0 ¬µg/ml hemin, 37 hits; 0.001 ¬µg/ml, 76; 2 ¬µg/ml, 161). But by microarray, PGN_1085 was down-regulated in the hemin-replete condition, and no fold- change under limiting hemin, suggesting that HaeR represses expression of PGN_1085 as the hemin concentration increases. An inverse correlation was seen with the promoter of <italic>bcp</italic> (PGN_1058, a putative bacterioferritin comigratory protein) since by ChIP-seq there were fewer hits with increasing hemin concentration, and <italic>bcp</italic> was more down-regulated in hemin-limited and ‚Äìreplete conditions than in the hemin-depleted condition, suggesting that when HaeR does not bind to the promoter transcription is reduced. Based on the data from microarray and ChIP-seq, we conclude that HaeR can act as a repressor and activator depending on both the promoter region and hemin concentration.</p>
<p>ChIP-seq data identified three classes of promoters based on numbers of their sequences in the sequencing pool at specific hemin concentrations. In the first class, the number of bound HaeR sequences increased as the hemin concentration increased, which occurred clearly with six promoter regions. The second class contained promoters that had decreased HaeR ‚Äìbinding with increasing hemin concentration as observed with fifteen promoters. The third category, observed with forty promoters, did not follow any obvious hemin-dependent binding trends.</p>
<p>Among the targets of RR PGN_0753 identified by ChIP-seq were 5‚Ä≤ untranslated sequences upstream of PGN_0704 (<italic>ihtA</italic>), PGN_0687 (<italic>htrA</italic>), and PGN_0556 (<italic>hmuS</italic>). RR binding to these sequences was confirmed by EMSA, therefore we conclude that the three loci, consistent with previously established roles in hemin transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-Lewis2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-Dashper2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-Slakeski1">[23]</xref> are directly regulated by PGN_0753. Furthermore, the ChIP-seq data indicated greater binding of HaeR to these promoters under hemin- depleted or -limited conditions, i.e. larger numbers of these sequences were in the ChIP-seq pool. The first locus, <italic>ihtABCDE</italic>, encodes a TonB-linked receptor and an ABC transporter cassette. IhtA (PGN_0704) is a TonB-linked receptor recently determined to be a BtuB homolog, an outer membrane cobalamin receptor protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-Hirano1">[24]</xref>. A coenzyme B12 riboswitch is located upstream of PGN_0704 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-Hirano1">[24]</xref>. Because acquisition and transport of iron into bacteria is essential for their growth the regulation of these processes is complex. The major uptake mechanism is via TonB-dependent transporters, however, their regulation depends not only on regulators such as on two-component systems but also ECFs and small RNAs, including riboswitches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-Noinaj1">[25]</xref>. As found in the present study, the promoters of several HaeR- regulated genes also contained regulatory elements at the RNA level, e.g. PGN_0704 (riboswitch), PGN_0556 (stem-loop structure), and PGN_1932 (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat [CRISPR] element). CRISPR elements are found in most bacteria and have mostly unknown function, however, are believed to offer resistance to bacteriophage and potentially silence DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-Waters1">[26]</xref>. Whether HaeR interacts with these or other regulatory elements will be the focus of future work. The second gene in the locus (<italic>ihtB</italic>, PGN_0705) encodes an outer membrane chelatase that removes iron from hemin for TonB receptor-mediated transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-Dashper2">[22]</xref>. The second locus, <italic>htrABCD</italic> (PGN_0687-PGN_0684) encodes an ABC transporter and a TonB-linked receptor (<italic>tlr,</italic> PGN_0683). A comparison of the proteome and transcriptome of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> strain W50 in response to hemin excess or limitation during growth in continuous culture identified upregulation of the <italic>htr</italic> and <italic>hmu</italic> loci upon hemin limitation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-Dashper1">[20]</xref>. Curiously, none of the <italic>iht</italic>, <italic>htr</italic> or <italic>hmu</italic> genes were found in our transcription analyses, possibly because of transcript instability or lack of expression under our experimental conditions.</p>
<p>The third gene cluster identified by ChIP-seq, <italic>hmu</italic>Y<italic>RSTUV</italic>, is the best characterized hemin transport system in <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>. Lewis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-Lewis2">[21]</xref> showed that in strain W83, <italic>hmu</italic>Y, the first gene in the operon, was highly transcribed even in the presence of hemin, and reported differential regulation within the cluster with higher levels of transcription for promoter proximal than promoter distal genes. In the present study, the DNA sequence 5‚Ä≤ to the first gene <italic>hmu</italic>Y was not enriched for PGN_0753 binding, rather the region upstream of the third gene, <italic>hmuS</italic>, was a target of PGN_0753 according to the ChIP-seq data, and binding was confirmed with EMSA. PGN_0556, <italic>hmuS</italic>, is predicted to encode a cobalamin biosynthesis-related protein and contains a stem-loop structure at the 5‚Ä≤ end of the gene which may allow for differential expression of the operon during translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-Lewis3">[27]</xref>. The region bound by PGN_0753 in the <italic>hmu</italic> locus may function as an activator during transcription, possibly by eliminating the stem-loop structure and permitting RNA polymerase read through and increased expression of the genes downstream of <italic>hmuR</italic>. As demonstrated by the QRT-PCR data, the presence of HK PG0719 in ATCC 33277 increased the relative expression of <italic>hmuS</italic> approximately 15- fold (hemin limited) and 39- fold (hemin replete) above the expression observed in the parent strain.</p>
<p>In addition to the <italic>iht, hmu,</italic> and <italic>htr</italic> transport systems for heme/iron, HaeR binding to the promoter regions of several other genes was also detected by ChIP-seq, e.g. TonB-dependent receptors, putative ABC transporters, and efflux-associated proteins. Of note are PGN_1085 (encodes ferrous iron transport protein B), and PGN_0890 and PGN_1830 that encode a TonB-dependent receptor with CirA domains that mainly transport iron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-Braun1">[28]</xref>. While TonB-dependent receptors transport heme across the outer membrane, and ABC transporters carry heme across the periplasm and inner membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-Nikaido1">[29]</xref>, cysteine proteinases comprise an important class of proteins that play a role in heme acquisition by releasing and binding heme from hemoglobin and other host proteins. The ChIP-seq data show that the promoter regions of RgpA and Kgp, were enriched under heme-deficient and -limiting conditions. The first indication of Kgp involvement in heme accumulation came from a key genetic study showing that <italic>kgp</italic> mutant colonies did not present the normal black-pigmentation phenotype due to heme adsorption at the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-Okamoto1">[30]</xref>. The mutants also produced less of a protein previously identified as a peptide component of the adhesin domains of Kgp and RgpA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-Nakayama1">[31]</xref>. Newer work showed that both proteinases were responsible for the capture of hemoglobin, its degradation and release and conversion of heme to m-oxo bishaem aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-Smalley1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-Smalley2">[33]</xref>. Most recently, gingipain and HmuY activities have been linked together in the release of heme from proteins degraded by gingipains and its capture by HmuY <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-Smalley3">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>In summary, our study of the HaeSR two-component system of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> allows us to conclude that it is essential for growth because of our inability to construct an RR deletion mutant in strains W83 and ATCC 33277, and the lack of transposon insertions in the HK in libraries of either strain. The natural HK mutation in ATCC 33277 compromised growth although the RR was retained and expressed at very low levels which may be sufficient for binding and activation of essential targets, ensuring survival. The HaeR regulon includes a number of iron uptake/acquisition genes, as well as those encoding transporters and metabolic functions. In addition, HaeR can act as an activator and a repressor depending on the target as well as hemin concentration during growth. Our data suggests that the TCS is induced by low concentrations of hemin since the ChIP-seq data indicated increased expression and binding of RR PGN_0753 to promoters in hemin-depleted or -limited conditions. Finally, we demonstrated that the HaeSR regulon includes, and HaeR directly regulates expression of, Kgp and RgpA, multifunctional virulence factors of <italic>P. gingivalis.</italic> Previously, it was demonstrated that GppX, a hybrid sensor kinase-response regulator protein, was associated with the maturation and localization of the gingipains on the cell surface, but did not affect transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073351-Hasegawa1">[35]</xref>. Our study has filled a knowledge gap in the complex and essential pathways for iron/heme utilization by <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>.</p>
