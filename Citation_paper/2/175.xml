      <abstract>
        <p>The diversification of gene functions has been largely attributed to the process of gene duplication. Novel examples of genes originating from previously untranscribed regions have been recently described without regard to a unifying functional mechanism for their emergence. Here we propose a model mechanism that could generate a large number of lineage-specific novel transcripts in vertebrates through the activation of bidirectional transcription from unidirectional promoters. We examined this model <italic>in silico</italic> using human transcriptomic and genomic data and identified evidence consistent with the emergence of more than 1,000 primate-specific transcripts. These are transcripts with low coding potential and virtually no functional annotation. They initiate at less than 1 kb upstream of an oppositely transcribed conserved protein coding gene, in agreement with the generally accepted definition of bidirectional promoters. We found that the genomic regions upstream of ancestral promoters, where the novel transcripts in our dataset reside, are characterized by preferential accumulation of transposable elements. This enhances the sequence diversity of regions located upstream of ancestral promoters, further highlighting their evolutionary importance for the emergence of transcriptional novelties. By applying a newly developed test for positive selection to transposable element-derived fragments in our set of novel transcripts, we found evidence of adaptive evolution in the human lineage in nearly 3% of the novel transcripts in our dataset. These findings indicate that at least some novel transcripts could become functionally relevant, and thus highlight the evolutionary importance of promoters, through their capacity for bidirectional transcription, for the emergence of novel genes.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The question of how new genes and new functions originate remains one of the most intriguing open questions in evolutionary genetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Conant1">[1]</xref>. For example, the duplication of existing genetic material was proposed as a solution to this problem nearly 100 years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Muller1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Muller2">[3]</xref>. Since then, the duplication model has provided the basis for explaining the expansion of genomes and diversification of various protein families <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Spofford1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Nei1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Fitch1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Ingram1">[7]</xref>, becoming widely popular with the publication of Ohno’s “Evolution by Gene Duplication” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Ohno1">[8]</xref>. The model proposes that the presence of two copies of the same gene frees one of them from functional constraints, allowing the second copy to mutate and develop new functions. The role of gene duplication in evolution is indirectly emphasized later on by François Jacob, who dismissed as a possibility the idea that functional proteins emerge through the random association of amino acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Jacob1">[9]</xref>. It follows therefore that the gene duplication is the most widely accepted mechanism for the diversification of the gene repertoire of every species.</p>
      <p>In addition to the mechanism of gene duplication, recent evidence accumulates to support the diversification of the gene repertoire through the emergence of novel genes from previously untranscribed regions. Examples of newly emerged lineage-specific genes include our previous work in cow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Piontkivska1">[10]</xref>, and extend to organisms as diverse as <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Yang1">[11]</xref>, yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Cai1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Carvunis1">[13]</xref>, Drosophila <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Levine1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Begun1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Zhou1">[16]</xref>, and primates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Johnson1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-TollRiera1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Knowles1">[19]</xref>. Nonetheless, Kaessmann recently highlighted the lack of a specific mechanism to account for the emergence of new genes from genomic regions lacking prior gene functions, i.e. “from scratch” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Kaessmann1">[20]</xref>. Here we propose and provide evidence to support such a mechanism for the emergence of novel genes. Specifically, we propose that some functional promoters initiate and establish transcription opposite to an endogenously controlled gene. If such regions lacked previous transcription activity, the activation of bidirectional transcription leads to the emergence of novel, lineage-specific transcripts. This mechanism is based on previous, limited associations between bidirectional promoters (BDPs) and lineage-specific transcripts in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Piontkivska1">[10]</xref>. Given the propensity of promoters for bidirectional transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Seila1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Preker1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-vanBakel1">[23]</xref>, we estimate that the lineage-specific activation of BDPs should be an important mechanism for the emergence of novel transcripts. Such transcripts would therefore emerge from regions without prior genic function, and would be spliced based on the presence of appropriate resident sequences that provide necessary spicing signals. Such novel transcripts provide a molecular pool for functional diversification and adaptive change.</p>

        <p>The proposed evolutionary mechanism predicts the presence of lineage-specific BDPs and associated lineage-specific novel transcripts in any species. BDPs are defined as regions flanked by two head-to-head (i.e. antisense-oriented) transcripts separated by at most 1 kb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Adachi1">[24]</xref>, while lineage-specific BDPs could be defined as those where one transcript is conserved across multiple species and the other is specific to a single lineage, such as the case of the BDP flanked by the <italic>CYB5R4</italic> gene and its DV834581 partner transcript in cow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Piontkivska1">[10]</xref>. Here we investigated the impact of this mechanism on the human transcriptome through finding primate-specific BDPs, because human is the species that presents both the deepest transcriptome data, necessary to capture non-conserved transcripts, and the highest relevance for the biomedical scientific community. To identify lineage-specific transcripts emerged through the activation of bidirectional transcription from active promoters, we started with identifying BDPs using transcripts annotated in the RefSeq, UCSC KnownGene and spliced EST reference sets (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), and avoiding short-lived RNA-molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Preker1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-vanBakel1">[23]</xref>. We limited our initial set to 1,945 BDPs with one transcript lacking an annotated open reading frame (ORF) and the other transcript corresponding to an annotated protein-coding gene. The lack of annotated ORF is consistent with non-coding expectations for most novel transcripts, while the protein-coding gene facilitates the evaluation of the evolutionary conservation and orthology assignment between genomes. At the same time, this makes for a conservative dataset because it ignores potential rare cases where novel transcripts have annotated ORFs, or cases where novel transcripts emerge from promoters of genes that do not code for proteins. If more than one transcript pair flanked a BDP region, we retained the pair with the closest transcription start sites (TSS), from which we further selected 1,467 pairs where the protein-coding transcript was conserved in mouse (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), which we refer to as “anchors”. We further eliminated 400 pairs where we found evidence of transcription at the mouse locus orthologous to the non-coding transcript, and we used these as a reference set for conserved non-coding transcripts (cncRNAs).</p>
        <p>Our final data set consisted of 1,067 BDPs flanked by anchor transcripts on one side, and transcripts considered to be primate-specific transcripts on the other, referred to as “<underline>p</underline>romoter-<underline>i</underline>dentified <underline>n</underline>ovel <underline>t</underline>ranscripts” (PINTs). To ensure that PINTs were valid transcription units controlled by BDPs, we had their transcriptional activity experimentally tested within the context of the GENCODE framework <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Howald1">[25]</xref> in eight tissues (brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, muscle, spleen, testis). In 34 of 39 cases examined, both the PINT and corresponding anchor were transcribed in at least one of the eight tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057323.s018">Table S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>It has been shown that BDPs flanked by two protein coding genes are randomly distributed across the genome, as their counts are significantly correlated with the gene abundance in each chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Liu1">[26]</xref>. We therefore expected that PINTs also display random genomic distribution, and compared their chromosomal distribution to that of protein coding genes with potential for initiating transcription upstream from their own promoter (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). We found no significant difference between the two sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057323.s001">Fig. S1</xref>), consistent with the BDP random distribution. Furthermore, to assess whether PINTs emerge due to specific functional properties of the anchor genes, we tested for gene ontology (GO) enrichment among anchor genes (see Supplementary Methods). No functional category showed a significant enrichment, indicating that the emergence of PINTs occurs randomly across the genome and is consistent with a model that is not reliant on specific properties of genes defined as anchors.</p>

      <sec id="s2b">
        <title>PINT-anchor Expression Correlation</title>
        <p>Identification of PINTs was based on structural characteristics of BDPs, but our evolutionary model, which involves the activation of bidirectional transcription, implies that the regions separating PINTs and their anchors also share functional characteristics of BDPs. Specifically, Trinklein <italic>et al.</italic> have shown that expression of genes flanking BDPs is significantly correlated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Trinklein1">[27]</xref>, which could therefore be also expected for PINTs and their anchors. To assess whether PINTs and anchors also present a correlated pattern of expression, we created a relative expression difference (RED) parameter that measures the difference between expression levels across several tissues for two transcripts (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). The parameter can capture the known correlation between the expression of protein-coding genes flanking BDPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057323.s002">Fig. S2</xref>), with lower RED values indicating higher expression correlation. To evaluate expression levels, we used data from the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST microarrays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Pohl1">[28]</xref>. Specifically, we used expression values associated with probes mapping in exons closest to promoters to avoid additional signals from hybridization of transcripts from alternative promoters not relevant to the activity of BDPs (as we showed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Jacox1">[29]</xref>).</p>
        <p>The distribution of RED values for PINT-anchor pairs has a median value of 12.6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057323-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Using a one-sided Mann Whitney U test (MWU), we found these values to be significantly lower than RED values computed for randomly associated protein-coding and non-coding genes (median 13.2, <italic>P</italic> = 7.6×10<sup>−7</sup>). We also found them to be significantly lower than RED values computed for adjacent pairs of protein-coding and non-coding genes, but which are not controlled by BDPs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057323-g001">Fig. 1</xref>; <italic>P</italic> = 2.6×10<sup>−3</sup>, MWU test). These data indicate that regions separating PINTs from their anchors share not only structural, but also functional similarities with BDPs, supporting the model of PINT emergence through the conversion of unidirectional into bidirectional promoters.</p>

        <title>PINTs are Poorly Conserved Across Vertebrates</title>
        <p>Our method of identifying PINT candidates is intended to find transcripts that have emerged in the primate lineage. Nevertheless, by using only mouse as a reference species (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), some of the identified candidates may represent transcripts that were specifically lost in the mouse or rodent lineage. Ideally, the latter alternative could be ruled out by analyzing orthologous loci in other placental non-primate species, but suitable extensive transcriptome datasets do not currently exist, despite recent advances in the field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Brawand1">[30]</xref>. The former alternative could be supported by low conservation of PINT sequences, since it would be expected that recently emerged transcripts exhibit lower sequence conservation levels across vertebrates relative to levels observed for ancestral transcripts. We therefore compared the sequence conservation in the exons of PINTs to levels observed in exons of cncRNAs, which represent comparable non-coding transcripts but which we found to be conserved between human and mouse. Using phastCons scores (computed from 17-way alignment of vertebrate species, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) as a measure of conservation, we found that PINTs exhibited significantly lower conservation than cncRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057323-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>; median phastCons scores 0.026 and 0.06, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = 4.9×10<sup>−11</sup>, MWU test).

As expected, PINTs were also significantly less conserved than anchor genes (median phastCons score 0.535; <italic>P</italic> = 1.2×10<sup>−299</sup>, MWU test).

        <p>To account for the possibility that PINTs represent RNA molecules with conserved secondary structures but lower nucleotide conservation due to compensatory mutations, we also investigated conservation at the level of consensus splice dinucleotides. These sites are known to be evolving under purifying selection, with newly acquired splice sites (SS), such as those of alternatively-spliced exons, being subject to relaxed constraints <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Shimada1">[31]</xref>. We found phastCons scores to be the lowest for PINT SSs (median score of 5×10<sup>−4</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057323-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>), and significantly higher for SSs used by both cncRNAs (median 0.0025, <italic>P</italic> = 1.5×10<sup>−37</sup>, MWU test) and anchors (median 0.9995, <italic>P</italic> = 0, MWU test).

        <title>Splice Site Recruitment</title>
        <p>Additional support for the novel character of PINTs could be provided by their selective use of splice sites (SSs). Newly emerged transcripts should lack any type of constraints, and therefore the splicing of such molecules into mature RNA products should utilize any splice signal (defined here as “GT” and “AG” dinucleotides on the transcribed strand) that meets the requirements of the splicing process, such as reasonable maximum entropy scores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Yeo1">[32]</xref> and required neighboring sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Dogan1">[33]</xref>. With the use of an appropriate marker, the use of SSs could be tested against the available splice signals across the transcripts’ genomic loci. A suitable marker for this test could be considered the origin of splice signals in transposable elements (TEs). The reasons are twofold. Not only are TEs known to carry ready-to-use splice signals, but such signals are rarely adopted into functional transcripts because of the risk of resulting disease phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Makalowski1">[34]</xref>.</p>
        <p>By analyzing the TE origin of SSs utilized by different transcripts, we found that PINTs had the highest fraction of TE-derived SSs: 37.9% and 23.4% for acceptor (3′) and donor (5′) SSs, respectively. The corresponding fractions were significantly lower for both cncRNAs (acceptor: 29.8%, <italic>P</italic> = 3.9×10<sup>−5</sup>, Fisher’s exact test; donor: 15.7%, <italic>P</italic> = 4.5×10<sup>−6</sup>) and anchors (acceptor: 0.7%, <italic>P</italic>&lt;10<sup>−16</sup>; donor: 0.6%, <italic>P</italic>&lt;10<sup>−16</sup>). We compared these values to background expectations based on available signals available at the genomic loci (after controlling for signal strength, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), and found that TE-derived acceptor SS usage in PINTs was not significantly different from the expected value. Specifically, the 37.9% fraction of TE-derived acceptor SSs used by PINTs was not significantly different than the expected 36.5% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.16, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057323-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), in agreement with random SS usage and relaxed or absent selection pressure acting on PINTs. In contrast, the values observed for cncRNAs and anchors were both lower than expectations (35.5% and 9.6%, respectively, <italic>P</italic>&lt;10<sup>−4</sup> in both cases; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057323.s003">Fig. S3</xref>), indicating that purifying selection is acting on SSs of older transcripts. In the case of donor SSs, all observed values were significantly lower than expectations (data not shown), suggesting that donor SSs are subject to additional constraints not captured by our model. Nevertheless, the randomness of acceptor SS usage in PINTs strongly agrees with a recent timeframe for the emergence of PINTs, precluding the selective constraint seen for the SSs of older and conserved transcripts.</p>

        <title>Preferential TE Accumulation Upstream of Promoters</title>
        <p>The lower conservation of PINTs and their random SS usage prompted us to investigate the impact of TEs on PINT sequences. Consistent with our previous observations, we found annotated TEs in the exons of significantly more PINTs (76.4%) than of either cncRNAs (62%, <italic>P</italic> = 4.9×10<sup>−8</sup>, Fisher’s exact test) or anchors (34.6%, <italic>P</italic> = 10<sup>−86</sup>). The big difference between the expected fractions of TE-derived signals at PINT and anchor loci (36.5% and 9.6%, respectively; see above) suggested that TEs occur at different rates across the corresponding genomic loci. Indeed, we found that PINT loci contain significantly more TEs than anchor loci (median values of 46.9% <italic>vs</italic>. 35.3%, <italic>P</italic> = 1.9×10<sup>−31</sup>, MWU test). In a plot of TE frequency in a 400-kb window centered on the anchor transcription start sites (TSS) the difference in TE content is highlighted by a peak located in the genomic loci of PINTs, upstream from anchor loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057323-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). The peak in TE frequency is consistent with relaxed functional constraints at PINT as compared to anchor loci. It follows that relaxed functional constraints, and consequently increased TE occurrence, should also be characteristic to regions located downstream from anchor loci. However, we found no perceivable increase in TE frequency downstream from anchor loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057323.s004">Fig. S4</xref>), which suggests that the preferential TE accumulation upstream of their promoters is likely favored by properties specific to active regulatory regions such as targeted histone modifications and associated open chromatin.</p>

        <p>The co-occurrence of high TE frequency and PINTs makes it tempting to speculate that increased TE activity is linked to the emergence of PINTs. If this were the case, we expect no peak of increased TE frequency when protein-coding genes not associated with PINTs are interrogated. However, when analyzing the entire set of protein coding genes, we found that preferential TE accumulation upstream of gene loci is a characteristic shared by many genes, which we confirmed in the genomes of human (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057323.s005">Fig. S5</xref>) and mouse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057323.s006">Fig. S6</xref>), as well as in non-mammalian species such as chicken (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057323.s007">Fig. S7</xref>). The phenomenon is emphasized when only lineage-specific TEs (e.g. most recently active) are investigated, such as human Alu (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057323.s008">Fig. S8</xref>), mouse B1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057323.s009">Fig. S9</xref>), and chicken CR1 repeats (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057323.s010">Fig. S10</xref>).

        <title>Positive Selection Acting on PINTs</title>
        <p>One of the most important evolutionary questions related to the emergence of PINTs in any genome is whether such novel transcripts could acquire novel functions. Owing to their young age, we postulate that most PINTs have a neutral functional impact on the host organism. Nonetheless, some of these transcripts could acquire novel functions, and consequently be subjected to positive selection. Finding such transcripts could help with the understanding of lineage-defining traits, and with the prioritization of candidates for experimental validation.</p>
        <p>In the case of protein coding genes, a classic sign of positive selection is a high ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS). Since PINTs lack conventional ORFs and have low coding potential (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057323.s011">Fig. S11</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057323.s012">S12</xref>), we searched for evidence of elevated rates of lineage-specific substitutions, which is as an indicator of positive selection for non-coding sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Kostka1">[35]</xref>. The high TE content of PINTs makes it feasible to propose a novel test for detecting signs of positive selection in PINT TE-derived fragments. The power of this test relies on the numerous specific TE homolog fragments located in intergenic regions that can be used to derive empirical distributions of expected human-specific substitution rates for each TE fragment. The set of specific homologs exhibits no sequence bias, evolves in a mostly neutral environment, and is rarely affected by transcription-coupled repair that might artificially lower the expected rate of substitutions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Hanawalt1">[36]</xref>. Local substitution rates can also be incorporated into the model to account for the mutagenic effect of increased recombination favored by certain TEs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Witherspoon1">[37]</xref>. Moreover, to rule out GC-biased gene conversion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Ratnakumar1">[38]</xref> as an alternative explanation to accelerated lineage-specific substitution rates, we searched for mutational hotspots that favor strong (G or C) over weak (A or T) nucleotides (see Supplementary Materials).</p>
        <p>We applied this test to all TE-derived fragments longer than 50 bps that are embedded in PINTs and have human-specific substitution rates of at least 2% (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). While this threshold is empirically chosen, it characterizes many of the human accelerated regions identified by Pollard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Pollard1">[39]</xref>, and serves to minimize the rate of false positives and to increase the power of detection after correction for multiple testing. In total we found 51 such fragments, of which 31 had significantly high rates at the individual 5% error level and overall 10% FDR (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Three of these fragments were located in mutational hotspots resembling regions of GC-biased gene conversion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057323.s019">Table S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057323.s013">Fig. S13</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057323.s014">S14</xref>). The remaining 28 regions indicate that the corresponding PINTs have been subject to positive selection in the human lineage.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our findings highlight an evolutionary model in which established unidirectional promoters gain the capacity for bidirectional activity to generate stable transcripts that can undergo splicing. This process can be easily generalized to all unidirectional promoters, and is fundamentally different from the process of gene duplication, which usually involves tinkering with copies of existing genes. The emergence of PINTs allows for the creation of transcripts from sequences without prior gene function, which in turn could contribute novel characters during evolution. The mechanism is likely to be present in all genomes owing to the presence of bidirectional promoters (shown here and elsewhere), and should be regarded as an important source of transcriptional innovation, driven by the promoter propensity for antisense transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Seila1">[21]</xref>. A conservative comparison with other regions (see Supplementary Materials) indicates that novel transcripts emerge upstream of protein-coding genes at a rate nearly five-fold higher than elsewhere (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057323.s016">Fig. S16</xref>). It is notable that less than 5% of PINTs contain sequences duplicated from other genes, which are located toward the 3′ end of PINTs, not their 5′ ends. This indicates that gene duplication plays an insignificant role in the emergence of PINTs.</p>
      <p>While the molecular mechanism for the PINT emergence is beyond the scope of this study, previous studies have shown that bidirectional transcription could emerge as a result of the inactivation of the Ssu-72 protein factor that has been associated with promoting divergent transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-TanWong1">[41]</xref>. One could also imagine that activation of bidirectional transcription could involve the suppression of transcriptional silencers or existing boundary elements (e.g. CTCF), or the acquisition of bidirectional regulatory elements such as GABPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Lin1">[42]</xref> and ZNF143 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Anno1">[43]</xref>. It is tempting to speculate that at least in some instances such events could be initiated as a result of TE insertions, given the preferential TE accumulation upstream of promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057323-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Other mechanisms could include the activation of bidirectional transcription as a result of chromatin alterations following TE insertions. Further studies are necessary to clarify the link between TEs and emergence of PINTs, since we found few PINTs relative to the number of loci where PINTs could have emerged.</p>
      <p>The preferential accumulation of TE-derived sequences upstream of active genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057323-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057323.s005">S5</xref>) represents a novel observation in genomes. The evolutionary importance of such insertions is likely to be multifold, such as through enlarging inter-genic distances, diversifying the genomic context from which PINT exons could be derived, interfering with existing regulatory elements or providing new ones. At the same time, TEs could influence the transcription process through their methylation status. For example, highly expressed PINTs are significantly fewer than expected in cerebellum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057323.s017">Fig. S17</xref>), where the methylation of Alu elements is high <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Xie1">[44]</xref>. In contrast, testes is the tissue with the most highly expressed PINTs, where the methylation levels of Alu elements are minimal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Rubin1">[45]</xref>. Therefore it is possible that the transcription of many PINTs was initiated in testes, consistent with the “out of testes” hypothesis for the emergence of new genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Kaessmann1">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The evolutionary importance of BDPs in generating novel functions is highlighted by the detection of positive selection in a subset of PINTs, indicating that among the novel transcripts that have emerged from non-genic regions, some could provide features that prove beneficial in the adaptive evolution of a given lineage. It is important to note that we found adaptive mutations that result in both exon gain and loss. In contrast to the case of AK094354, we found another exon under positive selection where the human-specific substitutions are associated with lower splicing efficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057323.s021">Table S4</xref>). This is a 118-bp exon which is part of the minor non-coding isoform of C22orf45, is derived from an AluSx repeat, and contains three human-specific substitutions (2.5% substitution rate). The exact functional consequence of such tinkering remains to be determined through dedicated experiments.</p>
      <p>Together, these data support a model whereby the conversion of unidirectional into bidirectional promoters is an important evolutionary mechanism capable of generating novel transcripts with functional relevance. Such transcripts could gradually acquire diverse functions as RNA molecules equivalent to lncRNAs, which are involved in transcriptional and epigenetic gene regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Saxena1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Orom1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Ponting1">[48]</xref>, or the capacity to encode proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Knowles1">[19]</xref>. This evolutionary model could explain why protein-coding genes derived from TEs are enriched among the genes controlled by BDPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Kalitsis1">[49]</xref>. Therefore, bidirectional promoters and associated novel transcripts should be regarded as important contributors to the pool of lineage-defining characters in the evolution of genomes.</p>

        <p>For the purpose of identifying primate and human specific transcripts generated from BDPs, we identified BDPs flanked by one protein-coding and one non-coding transcript, for which only the protein-coding gene is conserved in mouse (i.e. the “anchor”). Non-coding transcripts were considered RefSeq and knownGene transcripts that lacked annotated ORFs. We additionally considered EST annotations, but only those from the intronEst set, which by the virtue of them being spliced, minimize the possibility of including short-lived RNA molecules. To identify the protein-coding genes conserved in mouse, we mapped locations of orthologous protein-coding genes in the mm9 UCSC mouse assembly using the UCSC liftOver tool, and considered genes conserved if at least one protein-coding transcript was transcribed on the same strand within a 500 bp window centered on the position corresponding to the mapped human TSS. Additionally, we required that the proteins corresponding to the human and mouse loci were identified as orthologs through a reciprocal best BLAST hit approach. We then scanned the upstream region of the mouse orthologs and discarded any cases where a transcript was found on the opposite strand with a TSS closer than 1 kb.</p>

        <title>Evaluation of Transcript Expression</title>
        <p>To evaluate the correlation of expression between transcripts flanking BDPs, we used the Affymetrix exonic array data for 11 tissues (breast, cerebellum, heart, kidney, liver, muscle, pancreas, prostate, spleen, testes, and thyroid) available in the affyExonTissues table of the UCSC hg18 Table Browser. We used only probes mapping to the first exons (probes matching more than half of their size to TEs were excluded), which has the advantage of avoiding the influence of internal alternative promoters, where they exist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057323-Jacox1">[29]</xref>. We assigned each transcript an expression profile based on the ranking of probe median expression values in 11 tissues. The similarity of expression between two transcripts was evaluated with a parameter called <underline>r</underline>elative <underline>e</underline>xpression <underline>d</underline>ifference (RED) that compares the ranks of the 11 tissues with the following formula:<disp-formula id="pone.0057323.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0057323.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <italic>i</italic> represents the tissue, and <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> represent the rank in tissue <italic>i</italic> of the upstream and downstream transcripts, respectively. The RED parameter was only computed for BDPs where both transcripts had at least one Affymetrix probe mapped to their first exon (694 total pairs). In the case that more than one probe was found matching the first exon, RED values for all possible pairs were computed and the lowest RED value was reported. Distributions of expected RED values were computed both with pairs of randomly selected transcripts, as well as with randomly selected pairs of adjacent transcripts. For the former, we selected 694 pairs of transcripts, where the first represented a randomly chosen protein-coding transcript, which we paired with a randomly chosen non-coding transcript from the same chromosome but from the opposite strand. The number of such pairs from each chromosome matched the chromosomal distribution of PINT-anchor pairs. The process was repeated 1,500 times, for a total of 1,041,000 pairs. In the case of randomly selected adjacent pairs, we first defined all loci containing non-coding transcripts. Transcripts that shared at least one splice junction (either acceptor or donor) were combined into the same locus. Then, for each of the 20,217 protein-coding loci (see above) we found the closest non-overlapping non-coding locus, and retained only those pairs of anti-sense loci for which at least one transcript per locus had Affymetrix probes matched to their first exons. Loci with intergenic distances shorter than 1 kb were excluded from the analysis. From these, we randomly selected 694 transcript pairs (with the same chromosomal distribution as the PINT-anchor pairs), repeating the process 1,500 times. The same procedures were followed for pairs of protein-coding loci.</p>

        <p>To calculate the expected versus observed fraction of TE-derived acceptor SSs for every set of transcripts (e.g. PINTs, anchors, cncRNAs), we first constructed a distribution of SplicePort scores for actual acceptor SSs used by transcripts in each set. We then scored all “AG” dinucleotides available at corresponding genomic loci and determined whether they overlap annotated TEs. To determine the expected fraction of TE-derived SSs, we randomly sampled from the genomic “AG” dinucleotides the same number of dinucleotides as in the actual set of SSs used by transcripts in each set, requiring the SplicePort score distribution of randomly sampled dinucleotides was similar to the score distribution of actual SSs (the distribution was imposed on bins of size 0.1). The procedure was repeated 10,000 times, each time counting the number of dinucleotides that overlap annotated TEs. The expected fraction of TE-derived SSs was the median of the distribution constructed with 10,000 values. We used the same distribution to determine whether the observed fraction of TE-derived SSs represents an extreme value (i.e. is located within the distribution tails and corresponding to an alpha level of 5%).</p>

        <title>Identifying Regions Subject to Adaptive Evolution</title>
        <p>To identify regions subjected to forces of adaptive evolution, we first identified TE fragments in PINTs that have rates of human-specific substitution higher than 2%. For this purpose, we used 3-way human-chimp-macaque alignments available from the Galaxy web site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://galaxy.psu.edu" xlink:type="simple">http://galaxy.psu.edu</ext-link>). To decide whether the observed rate of human-specific substitutions was significant, we constructed an empirical distribution of human-specific substitution rates using TE fragments homologous to each specific TE fragment of interest. To find specific TE homolog fragments, we first determined the specific region in the TE consensus sequence that corresponds to the TE fragment of interest, as provided with the RepeatMasker alignment files for the pre-annotated hg18 assembly. We then identified all TE fragments from intergenic regions that correspond to the exact coordinates in the consensus TE sequence. The human-specific substitution rate for each fragment was computed as an excess over the local rate of human-specific substitutions. The local rate was evaluated in a 4 kb region centered on the TE fragment (2 kb upstream, and 2 kb downstream), to account for biases introduced by potentially increased local recombination rates. We retained only the TE fragments with more than 1 kb of aligned sequence within the 4 kb flanking regions. With the values obtained from all intergenic homolog TE fragments, we built the empirical distribution for the expected human-specific substitution rate, which we then used to evaluate the significance the human-specific substitution rate observed for the PINT-embedded TE fragments. Fragments with less than 100 homolog copies were discarded.</p>
