<title>Background</title>
<p>Pulmonary exacerbations (PEx), frequently associated with airway infection and inflammation, are the leading cause of morbidity in cystic fibrosis (CF). Molecular microbiologic approaches detect complex microbiota from CF airway samples taken during PEx.

</sec><sec>
<title>Objective</title>
<p>To determine the relationships between airway microbiota, inflammation, and lung function in CF subjects treated for PEx.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Expectorated sputum and blood were collected and lung function testing performed in CF subjects during early (0–3d.) and late treatment (&gt;7d.) for PEx. Sputum was analyzed by culture, pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons, and quantitative PCR for total and specific bacteria. Sputum IL-8 and neutrophil elastase (NE); and circulating C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Thirty-seven sputum samples were collected from 21 CF subjects. At early treatment, lower diversity was associated with high relative abundance (RA) of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (r = −0.67, p&lt;0.001), decreased FEV<sub>1%</sub> predicted (r = 0.49, p = 0.03) and increased CRP (r = −0.58, p = 0.01). In contrast to <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, obligate and facultative anaerobic genera were associated with less inflammation and higher FEV<sub>1</sub>. With treatment, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> RA and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> by qPCR decreased while anaerobic genera showed marked variability in response. Change in RA of <italic>Prevotella</italic> was associated with more variability in FEV<sub>1</sub> response to treatment than <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> or <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Anaerobes identified from sputum by sequencing are associated with less inflammation and higher lung function compared to <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> at early exacerbation. CF PEx treatment results in variable changes of anaerobic genera suggesting the need for larger studies particularly of patients without traditional CF pathogens.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pulmonary exacerbations (PEx), characterized by increased respiratory symptoms and worsening lung function, are the leading cause of morbidity and decreased quality of life in cystic fibrosis (CF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Gibson1">[1]</xref>. Recurrent PEx are associated with long term decline in lung function and shortened survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Amadori1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Sanders1">[4]</xref>. The causes of PEx are not fully understood; however, new acquisition or clonal expansion of chronically infecting bacteria, such as <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus,</italic> and the resulting inflammatory response are known to contribute <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Goss1">[5]</xref>. Treatment typically includes antibiotics targeting airway bacteria; however, airway cultures may not detect bacteria even during exacerbation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Zemanick1">[6]</xref>. In addition, 25% of patients fail to regain baseline lung function after treatment of a PEx, highlighting the need for improved treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Sanders2">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>CF airway infections are frequently polymicrobial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Sibley1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Bittar1">[10]</xref>. Given that a quarter of patients fail to fully respond to culture-guided treatment of PEx, improved understanding of airway infection is critical for the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Molecular analyses detect bacteria using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of bacterial small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU-rRNA) genes followed by fingerprinting [e.g., terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP)] or sequencing, most recently with high-throughput pyrosequencing of barcoded SSU- rRNA gene amplicons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Hamady1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Bittar2">[13]</xref>. Using strict anaerobic culture techniques and these molecular approaches, obligate and facultative anaerobes have been detected in high quantities from CF sputum during PEx. However, the contribution of anaerobes to PEx and lung disease in CF is incompletely understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Tunney1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Sibley2">[17]</xref>. Ecologic characteristics of the microbiota (e.g. diversity) have also been associated with lower lung function in CF, suggesting their potential use as a biomarker of lung disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-KlepacCeraj1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>Based on these studies, we hypothesized that airway microbial diversity and abundance of obligate and facultative anaerobes would be associated with increased airway inflammation and decreased lung function during CF PEx. In order to test this hypothesis, we sought to ascertain the relationship between airway microbiota, biomarkers of airway and systemic inflammation, and lung function in subjects with CF early in treatment of a PEx. In addition, we sought to determine changes in the airway microbiota following at least one week of intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy, and to correlate these shifts with changes in inflammation and lung function.</p>

<title>Ethics Statement</title>
<p>The study was approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board (COMIRB). Written informed consent and HIPPA Authorization were obtained from all participants over the age of 17 years or from parents or legal guardians of participants younger than 18 years. Assent was obtained from all participants under 18 years.</p>

<title>Study Population and Design</title>
<p>Patients with a diagnosis of CF (sweat chloride &gt;60 mEq/L and/or two known CF mutations) and a clinically diagnosed PEx requiring hospitalization were recruited at the time of admission. This study was designed to measure changes in desmosine, a biomarker of lung injury; details of this study were previously published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Laguna1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Laguna2">[20]</xref>. Our analysis included a cohort of subjects from the original study who were able to provide expectorated sputum on admission; preliminary data was published as an abstract previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Zemanick2">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>Subjects were evaluated at two time points during hospitalization, <italic>early treatment</italic> (day 0–3) and following ≥7 days of IV antibiotics or <italic>late treatment</italic> (day 7–14). These time points were chosen because most lung function improvement during PEx treatment is seen within this time period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Collaco1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-VanDevanter1">[23]</xref>. Study evaluation consisted of spirometry and collection of expectorated sputum and blood specimens. Spirometry was performed according to American Thoracic Society guidelines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Miller1">[24]</xref>. Antibiotics administered during hospitalization, at the discretion of the attending physician, were recorded.</p>

<title>Biomarkers of Inflammation</title>
<p>Sputum samples were analyzed as previously described for cytology, interleukin-8 (IL-8) [Luminex Multiplex Bead, R&amp;D Systems; Abingdon, Oxon, UK] and free neutrophil elastase (NE) activity [Spectrophotometric assay, Sigma Diagnostics; St. Louis, MO] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Laguna1">[19]</xref>. Plasma C-reactive protein (CRP; Cardiophase hsCRP, BN 11 instrument; Siemens; Deerfield, IL) was measured from blood samples (EDTA Plasma).

<title>DNA extraction</title>
<p>DNA extractions were performed using the Qiagen EZ1 Advanced automated extraction platform (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) with the bacterial card and tissue extraction kit. All sample manipulation was done in the BSL2 hood with appropriate laminar flow. Homogenized frozen sputum samples were thawed at 4°C and vortexed to ensure mixing. An aliquot of 200 µl for extraction was transferred into the tube provided with the EZ1 kit. Remaining sample was placed in a clean 2 ml tube and stored at −80°C. Extraction reagent cartridges, elution tubes and tip holders were loaded into the EZ1 sample rack as instructed by the manufacturer. Elution volume of 100 µl was selected and EZ1 DNA Tissue Kit program was run. Elution tubes with DNA extract were stored at −20°C.</p>

<title>DNA sequencing</title>
<p>Pyrosequencing of barcoded 16S rRNA gene amplicons was used to determine the bacterial communities present in each sample. We have established protocols for the efficient construction of highly multiplexed amplicon pools that exploit barcoded PCR primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0062917.s001">Figure S1</xref>) to allow assignment of each sequence detected to the appropriate sample <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Hamady1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Harris2">[28]</xref>. Each DNA extract was PCR amplified in triplicate with a specific barcoded primer. A negative amplification control was run for all barcodes, and any sample where the control exhibited amplification by agarose gel electrophoresis underwent repeat PCR amplification. PCR reactions consisted of 10 µl 2.5X HotMaster PCR Mix (Eppendorf), 0.3 µM each primer, 10–100 ng template DNA in a total reaction volume of 25 µl. PCR reactions were cycled with an Eppendorf Mastercycler using the following cycling parameters: 2 minutes denaturating at 95°C followed by 30 cycles of 20 s at 95°C (denaturing), 20 s at 52°C (annealing) and 60 s at 65°C (elongation). Mixtures were normalized using the SequalPrep Kit (Invitrogen) and mixed in equal volumes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Harris2">[28]</xref>. The pooled amplicons were concentrated by evaporation and gel purified (Montage) prior to sequencing. Barcoded libraries of rRNA amplicons were sequenced using the 454 platform (454 Roche Life Sciences, Branford, CT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Hamady1">[11]</xref>. The primers (27F/338R) target the V1/2 region of the bacterial rRNA gene. The linker sequence included in our fusion primer is a 2-nucleotide feature that disrupts hybridization between the rRNA primer and barcode/454 adaptor. This feature was designed by changing the last 2 bases in the rRNA primer, and was added due to lineage specific sequence conservation within the barcode or adaptor sequences that may have favored particular lineages in a primer specific manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Hamady1">[11]</xref>. The DNA sequencing data was deposited in the NCBI Short Read Archive database under the accession SRA052781 following guidelines from the National Center for Biotechnology Information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Wheeler1">[29]</xref>.</p>

<title>Post sequencing informatics</title>
<p>Initial quality checks were performed during the de-convolution of the amplicon pool based on the primer barcode sequence using the software package BARTAB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Frank1">[30]</xref>. These checks included identification of a legitimate barcode sequence, sequencing length (&gt;200 nucleotides, &gt;Q20 using a 10 base sliding window), and excluding ambiguous bases. Additional quality checks consisted of alignment with Infernal to confirm that the sequences conformed to the bacterial rRNA secondary structure and ChimeraSlayer to detect sequences derived from multiple templates and exclude chimeras <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Nawrocki1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Haas1">[32]</xref>. RDP Classifier was used to identify the source of all sequences that pass these quality checks. A standalone version of the RDP classifier java code version 2.4 with MSU training set V7 (dating from Jan 12, 2012) was used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Cole1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Wang1">[34]</xref>.

<p>We also performed an ancillary analysis using BLAST to compare study sequences versus all of the isolate sequences in Silva Release 104 labeled as “isolate” to attempt a species level assignment for each sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Altschul1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Pruesse1">[37]</xref>. BLAST hits were required to have E values of at least 10<sup>−5</sup> and to overlap the Silva isolate sequence by at least 95%. The Silva taxonomy line associated with the best BLAST hit was required to match the taxonomy line reported by RDP at the genus level in order to append the binomial name of the isolate to the RDP taxonomy line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Altschul1">[36]</xref>. For select genera of particular interest, specifically, <italic>Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Haemophilus, Stenotrophomonas, Prevotella</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus,</italic> species names were examined. Counts for each unique taxonomic line were tabulated for each sample, and tables containing all samples in an analysis were generated. Independent tables were generated for RDP and the BLAST extended analysis.</p>
<p>We used classification approaches rather than numerical operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on pairwise sequence comparisons for several reasons. First, the classifier assignments are stable (within a software release and training set) unlike OTUs where the sample composition of the analysis affects the outcome. Second, each sequence is independently classified even within a sample. This eliminates the optimization across all sequences that are required for numerical OTUs, which is highly dependent on the specific algorithm used for OTU selection. Finally, the RDP classification approach generates a bootstrap confidence estimate for each level of taxonomic assignment that can be used to filter the results further (e.g. analysis of only sequences that are identified to genus level).</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Subject variables were described using percentages, median and range values. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of all subjects who had a sputum sample collected at early treatment of PEx, and a paired-sample analysis for a subgroup of subjects who had sputum samples collected at both early and late treatment PEx. Inflammatory biomarkers were log<sub>10</sub> transformed and anchored at 1. Total and specific bacterial loads were determined by qPCR in triplicate; these values were log<sub>10</sub> transformed, anchored at 1 and then averaged. Change in qPCR measurements with treatment were described using the median and range values and evaluated using a Signed rank test. Change in FEV<sub>1%</sub> predicted, inflammatory biomarkers and qPCR with treatment were described using the median and range values and evaluated using a Signed rank test.</p>
<p>Pyrosequencing: Shannon Diversity, an ecologic parameter describing the richness and evenness of a microbial community, was determined for each sample using rarefaction to the number of sequences in the smallest library <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Magurran1">[38]</xref>. The number of effective species, or the true diversity, was also calculated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Jost1">[39]</xref>. This measure aids in the interpretation and comparison of the diversity indices by transforming the number into a variable that corresponds to the number of equally-common species. To account for variable sequencing effort, relative abundance (RA) of each genus was calculated by dividing the sequence counts by the total number of sequences, and used for further analyses. This approach takes into account that the differences in the total number of sequences for each case can vary and transforms the pyrosequencing information into relative quantities rather than absolute sequence counts. Genera detected at early treatment were described using median and range values as well as the proportion of samples for which the genera was detected. The genera were ranked by RA within each sample and the most dominant (top ranked) genus was identified. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed on sputum microbial and inflammatory markers using the correlation matrix after transforming the microbial measurements using the centered log ratio transformation recommended for compositional data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Nawrocki1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Haas1">[32]</xref>. The resulting principal components, linear combinations of the microbial and inflammatory markers, were correlated with FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted using a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. The associations between bacterial genera, clinical parameters and inflammatory biomarkers at the early treatment visit were also evaluated using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, and corresponding confidence intervals were calculated using Fisher’s transformation.</p>
<p>Subjects who had sputum samples collected at both early and late treatment PEx were included in a paired-sample analysis. Change in airway microbiology was plotted using the median of samples where the genus was detected in either early or late treatment. Particular genera of interest were analyzed further using a Signed rank test. To examine the relationship of change in bacterial genera with changes in inflammation and change in FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted, the differences between early and late treatment measurements were calculated. The association between these differences was evaluated using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients. Confidence intervals for these correlations were estimated using Fisher’s transformation. To estimate the contribution of changes in specific bacterial genera in explaining the variability in response to treatment, defined as the change in FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted, a linear regression model was used to obtain R<sup>2</sup> values and corresponding confidence intervals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Cohen1">[40]</xref>. Comparison of pyrosequencing to culture results was performed by calculating sensitivity and specificity using culture as the gold standard. For all analyses, p-values ≤0.05 were considered significant, and p-values of 0.06 to 0.1 were considered marginally associated. Analyses were performed using SAS Version 9.2 software (SAS Institute Inc.: Cary, NC, 2008).</p>

<title>Subject Characteristics and Specimens Collected</title>
<p>Fifty-three CF subjects were recruited for the study. Twenty-one subjects were able to spontaneously expectorate sputum within three days of admission and were included in this analysis. Subject characteristics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0062917-t002">Table 2</xref>. Thirty-seven sputum samples were obtained consisting of 21 early treatment and 16 paired late treatment samples. One sputum sample did not have sufficient quantity for inflammatory analyses. As not all subjects had a late treatment sputum sample (due to discharge home at &lt;7 days in two subjects, inability to spontaneously expectorate in two subjects, and missing sputum sample in one), we examined our data in two ways: (1) cross-sectional analysis of 21 subjects at early treatment of PEx, and (2) paired analysis of 16 subjects with both early and late treatment PEx sputum samples. Subjects with paired early and late treatment samples showed significant improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> and decreases in airway inflammatory markers, IL-8 and NE, and circulating CRP in response to PEx treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0062917-t002">Table 2</xref>). Inflammatory and FEV<sub>1</sub> changes with treatment were similar to that reported in previously published studies of CF PEx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Ordonez1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Colombo1">[42]</xref>.

<p>There were 75 bacterial genera detected from the 21 early treatment sputum samples with a median of 12 genera per sample (range, 2–29). The total number of sequences per sample varied from 195–2,644 with a median count of 809 sequences per sample; relative abundance (RA) of each genus was calculated and used for further analysis. <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> or <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> was the top ranked genus detected in 62% of subjects; an obligate anaerobe was top ranked in the remaining 38% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0062917-t003">Table 3</xref>). The prevalence of the most frequently detected and top ranked genera are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062917-g001">Figure 1</xref>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using molecular sequencing for bacterial identification, we found that obligate and facultative anaerobic genera detected from expectorated sputum samples early in treatment of CF PEx were associated with lower inflammation and higher lung function whereas <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> RA was associated with increased inflammation and lower lung function. Change in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> RA with treatment was associated with improvement in lung function, whereas change in anaerobic genera was variable and was not associated with FEV<sub>1</sub> response to treatment, possibly due to the use of anti-pseudomonal antibiotics with varying anaerobic activity. The exception among obligate anaerobic genera was <italic>Prevotella,</italic> which was marginally associated with change in lung function, but was not associated with changes in CRP or sputum inflammatory markers. All subjects had at least one CF pathogen detected during early treatment; thus, our findings may not be applicable to a patient group with negative sputum cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Zemanick1">[6]</xref>. In addition, we relied on spontaneously expectorated sputum samples, suggesting that patients included in this cohort may have more significant lung disease compared to non-expectorating patients.</p>
<p>Change in <italic>Prevotella</italic> RA, when controlled for <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>, was associated with variability in lung function change with treatment, suggesting that <italic>Prevotella</italic> may serve as a microbial marker of response to treatment. <italic>Prevotella</italic> species have been detected previously from CF sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid using anaerobic culture and culture independent techniques, and suggested as potential pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Harris1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Tunney2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Zemanick3">[45]</xref>. Cell culture and animal lung models have found that <italic>Prevotella intermedia</italic> becomes cytotoxic and immunogenic when present in high quantities (&gt;10<sup>8</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Ulrich1">[46]</xref>. Our data do not answer the question of whether or not <italic>Prevotella</italic> is a pathogen in CF; however, the number of patients in our study was small and the majority of patients were infected with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. The three subjects with the largest change in <italic>Prevotella</italic> with treatment had inversely related changes in lung function. Whether these subjects represent a subgroup of patients who may benefit from antimicrobial treatment directed at <italic>Prevotella</italic> is not known. <italic>Prevotella</italic> also represent a much more heterogeneous group of organisms than <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, and thus pathogenic <italic>Prevotella</italic> types may require more specific identification. Although we attempted to look at this using qPCR assays for specific <italic>Prevotella</italic> species, our small numbers limited our conclusions. Further investigation of <italic>Prevotella</italic> as indicator of treatment response is warranted as microbial markers could be useful in identifying underlying mechanisms of disease, identifying patients at risk for poor response and in clinical trials.</p>
<p>One possible explanation for the lack of association between anaerobes, inflammation and lung function, is that anaerobes may be present in sputum samples due to oral contamination from saliva. Rogers and colleagues compared bacterial communities in sputum and mouthwash from CF subjects using T-RFLP and found that oral cavity bacteria did not significantly contaminate sputum, although some bacteria were shared between the two sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Rogers2">[47]</xref>. Comparisons of sputum with throat swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid have also indicated that anaerobes are present in the lower airways in CF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Tunney1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Worlitzsch1">[16]</xref>. More recently, Goddard and colleagues called these findings into question by comparing sputum and throat samples to lung explants. They found that sputum samples overestimated the diversity and abundance of non-typical organisms compared to direct sampling of the lung, at least in patients with end-stage lung disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Goddard1">[48]</xref>. An alternative hypothesis for our findings is that a core microbiota including anaerobes such as <italic>Prevotella</italic> and <italic>Veillonella</italic> may be present in healthy airways with disruption of this microbiota leading to disease, as has been suggested by studies in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Hilty1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-ErbDownward1">[50]</xref>. Given the rarity of direct lung samples, the processing, analysis and interpretation of molecular results from sputum samples is an important area for future research. Understanding the relationship between disruption of the normal microbiota and disease progression may also lead to improved treatment.</p>
<p>We also found that low diversity was associated with lower lung function and increased inflammation. This was driven by a predominance of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> in samples with low diversity, similar to previous CF studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-KlepacCeraj1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Cox1">[51]</xref>. One potential explanation is that as lung disease progresses and chronic infection develops, normal microbiota are disrupted and diversity decreases, although antibiotic use may be an important factor in this relationship <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Zhao1">[52]</xref>. Total bacterial load did not change substantially following at least one week of IV antibiotic therapy. Diversity on average did not change, although some individual subjects experienced a marked increase or decrease in diversity and effective number of species. There were also changes in RA of specific genera, particularly <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus,</italic> and decreased <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> by qPCR. Anaerobic genera remained relatively stable, although individual patients experienced changes. Potential reasons for this include the use of antibiotics with limited anaerobic activity (e.g. aminoglycosides, cefipime and fluoroquinolones) in over half of subjects or resistance of anaerobes to broad-spectrum antibiotics, particularly ceftazidime and piperacillin tazobactam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Worlitzsch1">[16]</xref>. As in most studies of pulmonary exacerbation in CF, subjects received multiple different antibiotic combinations, limiting our ability to control for antimicrobial activity of particular antibiotics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Tunney2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Fodor1">[53]</xref>. The lack of change in anaerobic bacteria, however, is consistent with findings from two previous studies of CF pulmonary exacerbation, which found minimal change in the number or quantity of anaerobic organisms detected by culture and T-RFLP after treatment with IV antibiotics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Tunney2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Worlitzsch1">[16]</xref>. In contrast, Daniels and Colleagues found decreased relative abundance of atypical bacterial species, including anaerobes, but an increase in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> with PEx treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Daniels1">[54]</xref>.</p>
<p>One potential limitation of molecular DNA based approaches is the inability to differentiate between live and dead bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Rogers3">[55]</xref>. It is possible that the lack of change in bacterial communities after antibiotics is due to detection of dead bacteria rather than persistence of these communities. However, bacteria targeted by typical CF antibiotics decreased, with the genera <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> both decreasing in relative abundance and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> decreasing in prevalence and quantity by qPCR. Our study also did not include sputum collections during periods of clinical stability and most early treatment sputum samples were collected after the initiation of IV antibiotics; thus, we were unable to determine whether changes occurred in bacterial communities with onset of PEx or during the first 24–72 hours of IV antibiotics. Our study, however, agrees with findings from others recently published. Tunney and colleagues collected exacerbation samples up to 48 hours after initiation of IV antibiotics, yet showed a decrease in aerobic bacteria and total viable bacteria by culture and total bacterial load by qPCR following IV antibiotic therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Tunney2">[15]</xref>. Daniels and colleagues attempted to define the changes in sputum microbiota using T-RFLP analysis around the time of IV antibiotic initiation in 12 adult CF patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062917-Daniels1">[54]</xref>. The degree of change was highly variable between individual patients and non- significant between day −7 days and +3 of treatment.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we found that early in treatment of CF PEx, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> RA, but not anaerobic genera RA was associated with lower FEV<sub>1</sub> and higher levels of inflammation. Furthermore, low microbial diversity was associated with higher RA of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, lower lung function and increased inflammation. With treatment, changes in RA of specific bacterial genera were markedly variable, in contrast to <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> which decreased. The changes in RA of anaerobic genera, with the exception of <italic>Prevotella</italic>, were not associated with change in FEV<sub>1</sub>. Given that CF PEx treatment results in variable changes of anaerobic genera suggests the need for larger studies particularly in patients without traditional CF pathogens.</p>
