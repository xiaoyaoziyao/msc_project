<abstract>
<p>Fatigue and diarrhea are the most frequent adverse effects of pelvic radiotherapy, while their etiologies are largely unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the correlations between fatigue, diarrhea, and alterations in gut microbiota induced by pelvic radiotherapy. During the 5-week treatment of pelvic radiotherapy in 11 cancer patients, the general fatigue score significantly increased and was more prominent in the patients with diarrhea. The fatigue score was closely correlated with the decrease of serum citrulline (an indicator of the functional enterocyte mass) and the increases of systemic inflammatory proteins, including haptoglobin, orosomuoid, α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin and TNF-α. Serum level of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was also elevated, especially in the patients with diarrhea indicating epithelial barrier breach and endotoxemia. Pyrosequencing analysis of 16S rRNA gene revealed that microbial diversity, richness, and the <italic>Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes</italic> ratio were significantly altered prior to radiotherapy in patients who later developed diarrhea. Pelvic radiotherapy induced further changes in fecal microbial ecology, some of which were specific to the patients with or without diarrhea. Our results indicate that gut microbial dysbiosis prior to radiation therapy may be exploited to predict development of diarrhea and to guide preventive treatment options. Radiation-induced dysbiosis may contribute to pelvic radiation disease, including mucositis, diarrhea, systemic inflammatory response, and pelvic radiotherapy-associated fatigue in cancer patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pelvic cancers are among the most frequently diagnosed cancers worldwide[<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and pelvic radiotherapy is often an integral part of the multidisciplinary approaches used to treat pelvic tumors [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, adverse effects following pelvic radiotherapy represent major complications and have been collectively termed pelvic radiation disease (PRD) [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Fatigue is a prevalent PRD symptom, which affects patients’ physical and psychosocial well-being, consequently resulting in a cluster of other symptoms, such as pain, sleeplessness, and anxiety [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Radiation enteropathy (mucositis), frequently accompanied by diarrhea, is another PRD symptom [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which further impairs the quality of life [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Moreover, fatigue and enteropathy may represent interdependent symptoms as suggested by the prospective study by Jakobsson et al. [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] with women undergoing pelvic radiotherapy for anal or uterine cancer.</p>
<p>Considerable progress towards reducing toxicity of radiation therapy has been made in recent years, especially by increasing the precision of delivery of the radiation beam, and by pharmacological interventions [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, our incomplete understanding of the precise etiology and inter-relatedness within the complex network of pelvic radiation disease symptoms hinders the development of optimized prevention strategies [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Recent explosion in knowledge stemming from culture-independent analysis of gut microbiota clearly points to the critical role of balanced mutualistic microbe-host interactions as an integrative point in the pathogenesis of not just the local intestinal inflammatory tone, but also in regulating systemic metabolism, extraintestinal inflammatory diseases, as well as the function of the central nervous system [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The gut microbiota is a dynamic ecosystem and is highly susceptible to environmental influences such as dietary factors or inflammation. In a small study, Manichanh et al. [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] showed that patients which suffered acute post-radiotherapy diarrhea had altered gut microbial diversity, an observation recently recapitulated in mice [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Germ-free mice were more resistant to radiation-induced enteritis [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], whereas manipulation of gut microbiota through administration of probiotics improved the gastrointestinal toxicity of radiotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These published data, along with the emerging relevance of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) suggests that gut microbial ecology may represent not only a potential tool for risk assessment, but also for reducing the symptoms of PRD via manipulation of the intestinal flora [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Interestingly, inflammatory response caused by the release of inflammatory mediators has been proposed to contribute to the development of fatigue [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Schubert et al. [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] described a significant correlation between fatigue and the release of IL-6. Moreover, intensity of fatigue is positively correlated with the severity of diarrhea [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Collectively, the available evidence suggests that fatigue, mucosal injury and diarrhea, and dysbiosis are really a continuum rather than a set of independent symptoms. However, no comprehensive and integrative molecular analyses have been performed to investigate gut microbial ecology along with fatigue and diarrhea induced by pelvic radiotherapy. In this study, we provide the first attempt to link those PRD symptoms through 16S rRNA-based microbial profiling, and describe associations among gut microbial dysbiosis and fatigue and diarrhea. Our pilot study also suggests that pre-existing changes in microbial gut ecology in cancer patients may not only play an etiological role in the development of post-radiation enteropathy, but that they may serve as a predictive tool, which may guide clinical approaches to the PRD prevention.</p>

<title>Patient demographics and sampling</title>
<p>A total of 20 patients, scheduled to receive pelvic radiotherapy for the first time at the Chongqing Zhongshan Hospital (China), were registered for this study. Exclusion criteria included prior chemotherapy, or administration of steroids, immunosuppressants and/or antibiotics within one month prior to sample collection. Two sequential stool samples were collected from each patient at time points before and just after radiotherapy. Three blood samples were acquired from each patient at time points: immediately before, at the 3<sup>rd</sup>-week and 5<sup>th</sup>-week of radiotherapy, respectively. Additionally, 4 gender- and age- matched healthy volunteers were recruited to provide samples as controls. All samples were aliquoted and stored at -80°C until further use. This study was approved by the Ethics Committees of Chongqing Zhongshan Hospital and Third Military Medical University, and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed-consent documents were obtained from all the participants in this study.</p>

<sec id="sec004">
<title>Assessment of diarrhea and fatigue during radiotherapy</title>
<p>In parallel with the time points in the serum samples, each patient completed a questionnaire to establish the grade of diarrhea associated with the radiotherapy. According to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), diarrhea was classified into five grades depending on the severity of patient’s condition [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Grade 0 indicates no diarrhea, grade 1 refers to an increase of four or fewer stools per day, grade 2 refers to an increase of four to six stools per day, and grade 3 refers to an increase of seven or more stools per day. Grade 4 indicates life-threatening consequences.</p>
<p>The intensity of general fatigue in this study was assessed using the modified Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20) subscale [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], which consists of four statements (I feel fit, I feel tired, I am rested, and I tire easily), The statements are rated against a five-point scale from “yes, that is true” to “no, that is not true”, and reported over time. The score ranges from 4 to 20 is based on patients’ reports of fatigue in face-to-face interviews, whereby a higher score indicates greater fatigue.</p>

<title>Biochemical marker measurement</title>
<p>Serum citrulline, orosomucoid, haptoglobin and α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin were determined using ELISA kits (USCN Life Science and Technology Co. Ltd, Wuhan, China). Serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was also measured using an ELISA kit (R&amp;D System, Inc., Minneaplis, MN). TNF-α was measured using a microfluidic chip kit (Millipore, Inc., Billerica, MA). The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were &lt;5% and &lt;10%, respectively. Serum samples were diluted appropriately and assayed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

<sec id="sec006">
<title>Pyrosequencing and bioinformatics analysis</title>
<p>The stool samples from the patients and 4 healthy volunteers were collected at designated time points. Bacterial genomic DNA was extracted from stool samples using a DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the modified manufacturer’s instructions [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Universal bacterial primers, which correspond to positions 341–534 of the conserved <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> 16S rRNA gene sequence, were used to amplify the 16S rRNA gene hypervariable V3-region. PCR amplicon libraries was created for each individual DNA sample. Prior to sequencing, each PCR product was purified with the Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and quantified using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Electron Corporation). Amplicon pyrosequencing was performed with standard 454/Roche GS-FLX Titanium protocols, where equimolar amounts of PCR amplicon libraries from each sample were pooled. A set of 8-bp barcodes designed by Fierer et al. [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] was used to pool and sort multiple samples in a single 454 GS-FLX run.</p>
<p>High-quality pyrosequencing reads were screened out according to barcode- and primer-sequence filtering as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Sequences were aligned in with SILVA ribosomal RNA database and clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The OTUs that reached at a 97% similarity level were used for alpha diversity (Shannon), richness (Chao), Good’s coverage, and rarefaction curve analysis using the mothur software [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Taxonomy-based analyses were performed by classifying each sequence using the Naïve Bayesian Classifier program of the Michigan State University Center for Microbial Ecology Ribosomal Database Project database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/" xlink:type="simple">http://rdp.cme.msu.edu</ext-link>) with a 50% bootstrap score [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Phylogenetic beta diversity was measured using OTUs for each sample using the mother software [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>

<sec id="sec007">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis of the non-sequencing data was performed using the SPSS Software Package (SPSS version 17.0, IBM, Armonk, NY). Results are expressed as means ± standard deviation (SD). The statistical analysis was carried out with ANOVA followed by Tukey post-hoc test, paired or unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test or non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test, as appropriate. Correlations were calculated with the Pearson and partial correlation tests. Values of <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Patient characteristics</title>
<p>Twenty patients were screened over the course of radiotherapy. Nine patients, who took steroids, immunosuppressants and/or antibiotics within one month of sample collection, or failed to supply the required questionnaires, and/or provide sequential samples, were excluded from the study. 11 patients were included in the final analysis, of whom eight females suffered from cervical cancer, one female from anal cancer and two males from colorectal cancer. Median age of the cohort was 51 years (range, 41–64 years). None of those patients received chemotherapy, and underwent their first conventional radiotherapy at a dosage of 1.8–2.0 Gy/day, five times a week during the 5-week period (a cumulative dosage of 44–50 Gy) (<xref rid="pone.0126312.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Occurrences of fatigue and diarrhea induced by pelvic radiation in the patients</title>
<p>The summary of the questionnaires concerning adverse effects of pelvic radiotherapy reflected a common symptom of fatigue among all subjects. According to the criteria of CTCAE diarrhea grade, 6 out of 11 patients suffered diarrhea with varying severity recorded on the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> week of radiotherapy (<xref rid="pone.0126312.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Prior to treatment, the MFI-20 general fatigue score was identical in patients who did or did not develop symptoms of diarrhea post-radiotherapy (<xref rid="pone.0126312.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). In patients without diarrhea, the fatigue score increased slightly after radiotherapy, but it did not reach statistical significance (<xref rid="pone.0126312.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). However, patients with diarrhea reported dramatically increased fatigue score at both third and fifth week of radiotherapy (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01; <xref rid="pone.0126312.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>), thus suggesting that diarrhea contributes to the patients’ fatigue during radiotherapy.</p>

<title>Changes in serum levels of biomarkers in response to pelvic radiation therapy and their correlation with fatigue and diarrhea</title>
<p>To explore the etiopathogenesis of radiation-induced fatigue and diarrhea, serum levels of biomarkers related to intestinal injury and systemic inflammation were analyzed. Plasma citrulline, a nitrogen end product of glutamine metabolism in the enterocytes, is an established indicator of the functional enterocyte mass [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and has been described as a surrogate marker of radiation-induced small bowel mucosal atrophy [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Serum citrulline concentration significantly decreased during radiotherapy in all patients regardless of the ensuing diarrhea (<xref rid="pone.0126312.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). However, it was significantly lower in patients with diarrhea both three and five weeks into radiotherapy (<xref rid="pone.0126312.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). These results suggest that diarrhea was associated with a more significant intestinal epithelial atrophy during pelvic radiotherapy. Moreover, we observed a significant negative correlation (<italic>r</italic> = -0.648, <italic>p</italic> = 0.031; <italic>r</italic> = -0.658, <italic>p</italic> = 0.028 for 3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> wk respectively) between MFI-20 general fatigue scores and citrulline concentration in the following 5-week treatment.</p>

<p>All three acute phase proteins selected as systemic markers of inflammation, haptoglobin, orosomucoid and α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin, were significantly and time-dependently elevated in all patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy, reaching statistical significance at the 5<sup>th</sup> week time point (p&lt;0.05; Fig <xref rid="pone.0126312.g002" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0126312.g002" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). Of the three proteins, only haptoglobin showed significant further increase in patients who developed diarrhea during 3- to 5- week treatment (<xref rid="pone.0126312.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). At the 5<sup>th</sup> week time point, general fatigue was positively correlated with haptoglobin (<italic>r</italic> = 0.796, <italic>p</italic> = 0.003), with strong partial correlation under control variables of orosomucoid and α1-antitrypsin (<italic>r</italic> = 0.718, <italic>p</italic> = 0.029). Significant positive correlations were also found between general fatigue scores and concentrations of serum orosomucoid at both of the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> week time points (<italic>r</italic> = 0.612, <italic>p</italic> = 0.045 and <italic>r</italic> = 0.630, <italic>p</italic> = 0.038, respectively).

<title>Altered gut microbial ecology in the cancer patients prior to pelvic radiotherapy</title>
<p>We compared the stool microbiome profile between the patients and 4 healthy volunteers. A total of 170,021 high-quality sequences were obtained in this study.

<title>Microbial community structure in the gut is significantly altered after pelvic radiotherapy</title>

In patients who developed diarrhea, but not in those who did not, radiotherapy resulted in a significant increase in unclassified bacteria (Phylum:others) (to 2.47% vs. 0.88%, respectively).</p>
<p>The microbial composition was also significantly different at the genus level prior to and post-radiotherapy in both groups of cancer patients.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The concept of radiation therapy traces back to the discovery of X-rays in 1895 by Wilhelm Röntgen, and with recent technological advances in radiation, an increasing number of patients with abdominal malignancies are treated with pelvic radiotherapy in the future. However, gastrointestinal symptoms induced by pelvic radiotherapy remain a long-standing and unresolved problem. Especially, fatigue and diarrhea, which are frequently experienced by pelvic radiotherapy patients, have harmful impact on the quality of patients’ life and not infrequently lead to the suspension of treatment [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In this pilot study, we assessed the symptoms of fatigue and diarrhea, inflammatory markers, and fecal microbial ecology of 11 cancer patients over their five-week pelvic radiotherapy course. Within the limitation of the small patient cohort, we describe that fatigue is positively correlated with diarrhea and systemic markers of inflammation. Moreover, we showed that gut microbiota was not only affected by radiotherapy, but more importantly, that pre-existing changes in gut microbial ecology may serve as a predictive tool to identify patients who are more likely to progress to diarrhea after pelvic irradiation.</p>
<p>We found that the serum levels of haptoglobin, orosomucoid and α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin, the markers of systemic inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], were significantly elevated after pelvic radiotherapy. The positive correlations between fatigue and the elevation of these three proteins suggest that inflammation may contribute to the experienced fatigue. Consistent with an earlier study [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], we also observed that patients with diarrhea suffered from more severe fatigue. It is plausible that these patients experience more severe inflammation, as the serum levels of the inflammatory biomarkers were elevated more significantly in patients reporting higher fatigue scores (Figs <xref rid="pone.0126312.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0126312.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This also suggests that inflammation actuates the pathophysiology of diarrhea.</p>
<p>The etiology of aberrant inflammation, commonly encountered in patients during radiotherapy, is likely multifactorial. Tumor necrosis and collateral damage to normal tissues is accompanied by intestinal injury, compromised epithelial barrier and enhanced intestinal permeability, and an increased translocation of bacteria and proinflammatory luminal components. This viewpoint is supported by the findings of our study and previous reports that significant decrease in serum citrulline concentration, which indicates progressive intestinal epithelial atrophy [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], was accompanied by an increase in serum levels of TNFα and LPS during the treatment, especially in patients who developed diarrhea (<xref rid="pone.0126312.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). The fact that endotoxemia was primarily observed in patients with diarrhea who also showed more elevated TNFα concentrations, suggests that mucositis and altered microbial-host interactions are at the heart of pelvic radiation disease.</p>
<p>The key role of gut microbiota in PRD has been postulated based on resistance if germ-free mice to radiation-induced enteritis [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], by post-radiotherapy changes in gut microbial diversity [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and partial alleviation of the gastrointestinal toxicity of radiotherapy by probiotics [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, it was not surprising to find that radiotherapy had a profound effect on fecal microbial ecology in our patient cohort.</p>
<p>Several studies indicated that patients receiving cytotoxic and radiation therapy exhibit marked changes in intestinal microbiota, with most frequent decrease in <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>, <italic>Clostridium</italic> cluster XIVa, <italic>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</italic>, and increase in <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> and <italic>Bacteroides</italic> (recently reviewed by Touchefeu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]). These changes may contribute to the development of mucositis, particularly diarrhea and bacteremia. In our study, a significant difference in the abundance ratio of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> to <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> was observed in the cancer patients before and after pelvic radiotherapy. Moreover, we also found a remarkable decrease in the diversity and richness of gut flora after radiotherapy treatment, as well as significant differences in the relative abundance of selected genera between patients who developed or did not develop diarrhea. The latter finding may be related to differences in the severity of local mucosal inflammatory responses, or to changes in epithelial transport or peristalsis, factors which were not investigated in our patients.</p>
<p>A more striking observation is related to changes in gut microbial ecology prior to pelvic radiotherapy. Patients who progressed to diarrhea had significantly lower microbial alpha diversity and higher Firmicutes/Bacteroides ratio compared to those who did not develop diarrhea. In taxonomic analysis of the two patient groups pre-radiotherapy, we found significant differences in the relative abundance of <italic>Veillonella</italic>, <italic>Prevotella</italic>, <italic>Parabacteroides</italic>, <italic>Oscillibacter</italic>, <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic>, <italic>Dialister</italic>, <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, <italic>Clostridia</italic> clusters XI and XVIII, and unclassified (Genus: others) (<xref rid="pone.0126312.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). Although based on our results it is not possible to causatively link any of those taxa to the etiology of radiotherapy-induced diarrhea, it is of interest that <italic>Clostridia</italic> cluster XVIII, which has been linked to promotion of regulatory T cell expansion and protection from colitis and allergic diarrhea [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], was significantly less abundant in patients who developed diarrhea. Similar case can be made for <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic> genus, which includes a protective commensal, <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic>.[<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] On the other hand, <italic>Clostridium</italic> cluster XI, which includes a known diarrheal pathogen <italic>C</italic>. <italic>dificile</italic>, although less abundant prior to radiotherapy in patients who later develop diarrhea, is significantly expanded post-therapy, while in non-diarrhea patients it followed the opposite trend. While due to the pilot nature of our study we are not able to specifically and authoritatively address the role of these changes in promoting diarrhea, inflammation, and fatigue, these results strongly suggest the need for further and more detailed studies with larger cohort of patients. Such studies, as well as studies with gnotobiotic mice with humanized microbiota, may also point to specific taxonomic changes, which may be of predictive value, and potentially guide the preventive treatment with cytoprotective, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, or probiotics [<xref rid="pone.0126312.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>
<p>In summary, our study demonstrates a close association between gut microbial dysbiosis, fatigue, and diarrhea after pelvic radiotherapy, and justifies future larger scale projects in search of better predictive tools and prophylaxis of gastrointestinal radiotoxicity.</p>
