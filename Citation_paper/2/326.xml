            <title>Background</title>
            <p>Aberrantly elevated sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP), the lipogenic transcription factor, contributes to the development of fatty liver and insulin resistance in animals. Our recent studies have discovered that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylates SREBP at Ser-327 and inhibits its activity, represses SREBP-dependent lipogenesis, and thereby ameliorates hepatic steatosis and atherosclerosis in insulin-resistant LDLR<sup>−/−</sup> mice. Chronic inflammation and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome have been implicated in atherosclerosis and fatty liver disease. However, whether SREBP is involved in vascular lipid accumulation and inflammation in atherosclerosis remains largely unknown.</p>

            <title>Principal Findings</title>
            <p>The preclinical study with aortic pouch biopsy specimens from humans with atherosclerosis and diabetes shows intense immunostaining for SREBP-1 and the inflammatory marker VCAM-1 in atherosclerotic plaques. The cleavage processing of SREBP-1 and -2 and expression of their target genes are increased in the well-established porcine model of diabetes and atherosclerosis, which develops human-like, complex atherosclerotic plaques. Immunostaining analysis indicates an elevation in SREBP-1 that is primarily localized in endothelial cells and in infiltrated macrophages within fatty streaks, fibrous caps with necrotic cores, and cholesterol crystals in advanced lesions. Moreover, concomitant suppression of NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 and AMPK is observed in atherosclerotic pigs, which leads to the proteolytic activation of SREBP-1 by diminishing the deacetylation and Ser-372 phosphorylation of SREBP-1. Aberrantly elevated NLRP3 inflammasome markers are evidenced by increased expression of inflammasome components including NLPR3, ASC, and IL-1β. The increase in SREBP-1 activity and IL-1β production in lesions is associated with vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction in atherosclerotic pig aorta, as demonstrated by the induction of NF-κB, VCAM-1, iNOS, and COX-2, as well as by the repression of eNOS.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease, is the most common cause of cardiovascular death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Libby1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Bornfeldt1">[2]</xref>. Diabetes is a major independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Bornfeldt1">[2]</xref>. A key early step in atherogenesis is lipid deposition within the arterial intima, which in turn promotes leukocyte recruitment, foam cell formation, endothelial cell activation, and vascular inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Libby1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Bornfeldt1">[2]</xref>. Major clinical complications arise when atherosclerotic lesions evolve into complex and unstable forms, characterized by a thin fibrous cap and a large lipid-filled necrotic core <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Libby1">[1]</xref>. While inflammation is thought to be a hallmark of advanced atherosclerosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Libby1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Bornfeldt1">[2]</xref>, the molecular mechanisms that link lipid sensing pathways to vascular inflammation in atherogenesis remain elusive.</p>
      <p>Sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP), a key lipogenic transcription factor, resides as an inactive trans-membrane precursor in the ER. Once activated, SREBP is escorted to the Golgi where it is processed sequentially by two proteases to release the active fragment of SREBP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Goldstein1">[3]</xref>. The active mature form of SREBP enters the nucleus and activates the transcription of its target lipogenic genes encoding enzymes that are necessary for converting acetyl-CoA to fatty acids, triglyceride, and cholesterol under physiological conditions such as a refeeding state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Goldstein1">[3]</xref>. However, aberrantly elevated SREBP-dependent <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis contributes to the development of hepatic steatosis in insulin resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Raghow1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Horton1">[5]</xref>. We have recently discovered that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) directly phosphorylates SREBP-1 at Ser-372, represses the cleavage processing of SREBP-1, and suppresses the transcription of its own gene and targets <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Li1">[6]</xref>. AMPK activation by polyphenols attenuates hepatic steatosis and ameliorates aortic atherosclerosis in insulin-resistant LDLR<sup>−/−</sup> mice, at least in part, by suppressing the cleavage processing of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 and lipid biosynthesis in the liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Li1">[6]</xref>. The function of SREBP on lipid homeostasis in the liver and adipose tissue as well as its deregulation on metabolic abnormalities in fatty liver disease and obesity are well characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Goldstein1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Horton1">[5]</xref>. Although non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and atherosclerotic disease in humans have common pathological features such as the deposition of excess lipids in the liver or on the vascular wall, little is known about the relationship between SREBP and vascular dysfunction in atherosclerosis. This translational study provides the first evidence for an elevation of SREBP in atherosclerotic lesions in humans with diabetes.</p>
      <p>The nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has emerged as an important regulator of inflammation in metabolic disorders and atherosclerosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Duewell1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Vandanmagsar1">[8]</xref>. The NLRP3 inflammasome, a cytosolic protein complex that consists of the regulatory subunit NLRP3, the adaptor apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC, also known as pycard), and the effector caspase-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Schroder1">[9]</xref>, is activated by “endogenous danger signals”, such as the components released from necrotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Schroder1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Iyer1">[10]</xref> and cholesterol crystals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Duewell1">[7]</xref>. The stimulation of NLRP3 inflammasome triggers caspase-1 activation and subsequently promotes the cleavage processing and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Schroder1">[9]</xref>. Recently, SREBP-1a has emerged to directly activate the transcription of the NLRP gene in macrophages, which can couple lipogenesis with the innate immune response in endotoxic shock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Im1">[11]</xref>. However, it remains largely unknown whether dysregulation of SREBP is linked to vascular inflammasome in atherogenesis.</p>
      <p>The present study is the first to show an elevation of SREBP-mediated lipotoxic signaling in atherosclerosis in pigs and humans. Our clinical study with aorta pouch biopsy specimens from patients with diabetes and coronary artery atherosclerosis shows intense immunostaining for SREBP-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), a key inflammatory marker, in atherosclerotic plaques. To gain direct insight into a novel vascular function of SREBP, we take advantage of a well-established porcine model of diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis, in which plasma lipoprotein profiles with high levels of LDL in swine resemble those in humans, in contrast to high levels of HDL in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Jawien1">[12]</xref>. This atherosclerotic pig model is also capable of developing human-like atherosclerotic plaques with variable and complicated lesion phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Gerrity1">[13]</xref>. Our results show that diabetic, atherosclerotic pigs display striking phenotypic hallmarks of atherosclerotic lesions such as a mixture of early fatty streaks and advanced lesions with fibrous caps and necrotic lipid cores. The cleavage processing of SREBP-1 and -2 and expression of their target lipogenesis genes are increased in the aorta of atherosclerotic pigs. The hyperactivation of SREBP-1 is likely attributed to integrated suppression of SIRT1 and AMPK and impairment of the deacetylation and phosphorylation of SREBP-1. Abnormal activation of SREBP-1 is correlated with enhanced vascular inflammatory response in atherosclerotic pig aorta, as evidenced by the upregulation of inflammasome markers including NLRP3, ASC, and IL-1β, as well as an elevation of proinflammatory mediators such as VCAM-1, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). These preclinical studies provide biochemical evidence that the dysregulation of SIRT1-AMPK-SREBP pathway and stimulation of NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β production may coordinately contribute to the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis.</p>

         <title>The porcine model of diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis</title>
         <p>A well-established porcine model of diabetes and atherosclerosis was developed by Dr. Gerrity as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Gerrity1">[13]</xref>, which was evidenced by a 7-fold increase in fasting glucose levels (294±23 <italic>vs.</italic> 43±3 mg/dl) and an 8-fold elevation in plasma cholesterol levels (741±20 <italic>vs.</italic> 86±3 mg/dl). Briefly, diabetes was induced in 12-week-old male pigs (15–20 kg body weight) by the ear vein injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 50 mg/kg in 0.1 mol/L Na-citrate, pH 4.5, daily) for 3 consecutive days. The diabetic pigs were placed in a high cholesterol diet containing 1.5% cholesterol and 15% lard for 30 weeks. Non-diabetic control pigs were injected with a comparable volume of citrate buffer and placed on a Purina pig chow diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Gerrity1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Gerrity2">[17]</xref>.

For histology and immunohistochemistry, portions of the aortae were rapidly fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin acetate at 4°C overnight, processed and embedded in paraffin, and sectioned as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Li1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Li2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Zuccollo1">[16]</xref>.</p>

         <title>Histology and immunohistochemistry</title>
         <p>For histological study, aortic sections from atherosclerotic pigs and humans were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) as well as with Oil Red O as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Li1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Li2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Zuccollo1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Zang1">[19]</xref>. For immunohistochemical studies, after removal of paraffin and rehydration, 5-µm thick adjacent aortic sections were treated with 10 mmol/L citric acid (pH 6.0) and heated in a microwave (2 min, 3 times at 700 W) to recover antigenicity. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 10% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 60 min. The sections were incubated with SREBP-1 antibody (sc-367, K10, 2 µg/mL), advanced glycation endproducts (AGE) antibody (RDI, 2 µg/mL), VCAM-1 antibody (sc-8304, 2 µg/mL), iNOS antibody (BIOMOL, 1∶100 dilution), COX-2 antibody (Cayman Chemical, 1∶500 dilution), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Cat. No. N30020, 5 µg/mL), or α-SM-actin (Sigma, 1∶200 dilution) in PBS with 1% BSA at 4°C overnight. The sections were washed and subsequently incubated at room temperature for 1 h with a biotinylated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1∶500 dilution) using the Vectastain ABC kit. Positive immunoreactivity was visualized by red color of Vector® Red reaction product. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, cleared with xylene, and mounted. All positive staining was confirmed by ensuring that no staining occurred under the same conditions using nonimmune rabbit or mouse isotype control IgG (Vector). Staining images were captured and digitalized using an Olympus HC5000 digital camera attached to an Olympus microscope.</p>

         <p>Immunofluorescent double staining was performed as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Li1">[6]</xref>. All paraffin-embedded sections of control and atherosclerotic arteries were stained with MAC-2 antibody (ab53082, 1∶200 dilution) and detected using secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa fluor 555 (red). These sections stained with MAC-2 antibody were subsequently stained with either SREBP-1 antibody (sc-367, K10, 2 µg/mL) or IL-1β antibody (sc-78841, H-153, 1∶100 dilution) and detected using secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa fluor 488 (green). Finally, nuclei were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, blue). Overlapping images (yellow) of MAC-2 with either SREBP-1 or IL-1β indicates co-localization of SREBP-1 or IL-1β in inflamed macrophages of aortic plaques. The staining signals were specific inasmuch as incubation with non-immune IgG showed minimal detectable fluorescence under similar conditions. Images were captured under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon 80i Phase Contrast and Fluorescence Microscope, Japan).</p>

For immunoblotting analysis of SREBP proteins with a modification protocol, the total tissue lysates were subjected to sonication on ice for 20 seconds with the Sonifier 250 (Branson; output 2, duty cycle 20%), followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. Protein concentrations in supernatants were measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit, and total tissue lysates (100 µg proteins) were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with specific antibodies. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against phospho-Thr172 AMPKα (Cat. No. 2531), phospho-Ser-372 SREBP-1c (Cat. No. 9874), acetyl-Lys-382 p53 (Cat. No. 2525), acetyl-Lys-9 histone H3 (Cat.

For SREBP-1 deacetylation assays, SREBP-1 protein in total tissue lysates was immunoprecipitated with SREBP-1 antibody and Protein A/G-Sepharose beads at 4°C overnight. The precipitates were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer and twice with wash buffer (25 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mmol/L dithiothreitol). The acetylation of SREBP-1 was subsequently detected by immunoblotting with an acetylated-lysine specific antibody.</p>

         <title>Elevated SREBP-1 and inflammatory response are evident in aortic atherosclerotic lesions in humans with diabetes</title>
         <p>To gain insight into the clinical relevance of SREBP-1 to vascular inflammation in human atherosclerosis, aortic pouch biopsy specimens were obtained from patients with diabetes and coronary artery atherosclerosis and immunostained for SREBP-1, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SM-actin), and VCAM-1, a critical endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule in atherogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Li1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Zuccollo1">[16]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067532-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, the immunoreactivity for SREBP-1 was predominantly overlapped with atherosclerotic plaques containing lipid-laden macrophages that were positively stained by Oil Red O. Compared with minimal immunostaining of aortic sections with non-immuno IgG, the intense staining for SREBP-1 was primarily colocalized with VCAM-1-positive cells and macrophage-rich areas of the plaques, but to a lesser degree, in the lesions where smooth muscle cells were strongly stained with α-SM-actin. These data suggest a previously unrecognized relationship between SREBP-1 and increased adhesion molecules at early/intermediate stages of atherosclerotic plaques in diabetic patients.</p>

         <title>Characterization of aortic atherosclerotic lesions in a well-characterized pig model of diabetes and atherosclerosis</title>
         <p>Because of the limitation of aortic samples from diabetic, atherosclerotic patients, we took advantage of a well-established porcine model of diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Gerrity1">[13]</xref>, which was characterized by a mixture of early-to-mid stage lesions and advanced plaques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067532-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Compared with control pigs, the early stage lesions were characterized by a series of events that include increased intimal thickening with lipid deposit, lipid accumulation preceding macrophage infiltration, and macrophage-derived foam cell formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067532-g002">Fig. 2c</xref>). Advanced aortic lesions, such as a fibroatheroma, displayed a well-developed fibrous cap infiltrated by foamy macrophages overlying a necrotic lipid core at the base of advanced lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067532-g002">Fig. 2d–h</xref>). The fibrous cap in atherosclerotic plaques contained smooth muscle cells, which covered a mixture of lipid-laden foam cells, lipids and debris. The formation of more lipid-laden foam cells potentially promoted the migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells from the media into the intima, resulting in plaque progression. The necrotic core formation represented the accumulation of lipids and the process of macrophage apoptosis and necrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067532-g002">Fig. 2e, h and k</xref>). The formation of cholesterol clefts and foam cells in subendothelial regions and the thickening of the arterial wall act as a part of the atheromatous process, which were visualized by Oil Red O staining of aortic sections in diabetic pigs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067532-g002">Fig. 2k–o</xref>), but not seen in control pigs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067532-g002">Fig. 2i and j</xref>).

         <title>The proteolytic processing of SREBP and expression of its target genes are increased in the aorta of diabetic, atherosclerotic pigs</title>
         <p>Because our studies and others have indicated that SREBP-1 plays a role in the regulation of <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis induced by sustained hyperglycemia in hepatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Li1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Foretz1">[22]</xref>, we hypothesized that the development of complex atherosclerotic lesions might be partially ascribed to increased SREBP activity in the arterial wall <italic>in vivo</italic>. To test this possibility, the proteolytic processing of SREBP precursor was assessed by an immunoblot analysis of the precursor (∼125 kDa) and cleavage forms (∼68 kDa) of SREBP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Li1">[6]</xref>. Strikingly, the activated mature form of SREBP-1 was increased ∼2-fold in the aorta of atherosclerotic pigs as compared to that of normal pigs, whereas the membrane-bound SREBP-1 precursor was only slightly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067532-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), suggesting enhanced cleavage processing of SREBP-1 in the atherosclerotic pig aorta. To further determine whether the accumulation of mature SREBP-1 is functionally relevant to the stimulation of <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenic genes, the transcription of SREBP-1 target genes was assessed by real-time PCR. The mRNA amounts of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and stearoyl CoA desaturase1 (SCD1), the key enzymes for fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis, were significantly increased in the aorta of atherosclerotic pigs, consistent with the elevated mature SREBP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067532-g003">Fig. 3C–D</xref>). The mRNA levels of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) were also robustly elevated 10-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067532-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>), comparable to those of lipogenic genes including SREBP-1, FAS, and SCD1. Taken together with strong staining of SREBP-1 in human atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067532-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), these results suggest that the proteolytic activation of SREBP-1 and its associated lipogenic process may contribute to lipid accumulation and deposition in atherosclerotic aorta.</p>

         <title>Inhibition of AMPK activity is functionally relevant to the reduction of SREBP-1 phosphorylation at Ser-372 in the aorta of diabetic, atherosclerotic pigs</title>
         <p>We have recently discovered that AMPK specifically phosphorylates SREBP-1 at Ser-372, which in turn inhibits its processing, nuclear translocation, and auto-regulation, leading to decreased <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenic process in hepatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Li1">[6]</xref>.

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying SREBP-1 activation in atherosclerotic lesions, a possible role of AMPK and its phosphorylation of a new substrate SREBP in the development of atherosclerosis were assessed by immunoblotting analysis. The phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr-172, which is required for AMPK activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Zang1">[19]</xref>, was dramatically declined by ∼40% in diabetic pig aorta, without affecting expression of endogenous AMPKα, compared to normal pig aorta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067532-g004">Fig. 4A–C</xref>). Likewise, suppression of AMPK activity was confirmed by a ∼70% reduction in phosphorylation of ACC at Ser-79, a well-known substrate of AMPK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067532-g004">Fig. 4B and C</xref>). These results are consistent with the inhibitory effect of hyperglycemia on hepatic AMPK activity <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Li1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Zang1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Zang2">[20]</xref> and in STZ-induced type 1 diabetic mice <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Zang1">[19]</xref>.

         <title>The reduction of deacetylation of SREBP-1 is associated with suppression of SIRT1 in the aorta of diabetic, atherosclerotic pigs</title>
         <p>Weinberg's group was the first to identify that SIRT1 functions as an NAD-dependent deacetylase of p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Vaziri1">[23]</xref>.

Our recent studies indicate that overexpression of SIRT1 decreases the acetylation of p53 at Lys-382 in the liver of obese, insulin resistant mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Li2">[15]</xref>. Other studies show that SIRT1 decreases histone H3 at Lys-9 in ethanol-induced fatty liver in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Yin1">[29]</xref>. Because inhibition of SIRT1 is causally implicated in endothelial cell apoptosis in the atherosclerosis-prone aortic arch of high-fat diet-induced insulin resistant mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Xu2">[30]</xref>, expression and activity of SIRT1 were assessed in the aorta of atherosclerotic pigs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067532-g005">Fig. 5A and B</xref>, expression of SIRT1 was decreased by approximately 70% in the diabetic pig aorta, similar to the reduction of SIRT1 activity in diabetic mouse aorta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Xu2">[30]</xref>. Decreased SIRT1 activity was confirmed by a remarkable increase in the acetylation of p53 at Lys-382, accompanied by an elevation in the acetylation of histone H3 at Lys-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067532-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). The impaired deacetylation of p53 or histone H3 was well correlated with a reduction of SIRT1 in atherosclerotic pig aorta, suggesting that defective SIRT1 activity is implicated in atherogenesis and vascular injury. Because SIRT1 is thought to negatively regulate SREBP-1 via a mechanism involving the direct deacetylation and degradation of the nuclear form of SREBP-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Ponugoti1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-You1">[33]</xref>, we speculated that defective SIRT1 might modulate SREBP-1 activity in atherosclerotic pigs. To this end, <italic>in vivo</italic> acetylation assays revealed that in parallel to the reduced SIRT1 activity, the mature form of SREBP-1 was hyperacetylated in atherosclerotic pig aorta, even though the basal acetylation of endogenous SREBP-1 was detectable in control pig aorta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067532-g005">Fig. 5D and E</xref>). Notably, increased cleaved form of SREBP-1 in atherosclerotic pig aorta was also observed in immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067532-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>), similar to that seen in total cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067532-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). These results suggest that the pro-atherogenic effect of SIRT1 dysfunction probably act through the inhibition of SREBP-1 deacetylation and stimulation of SREBP-1activity.</p>

         <p>To assess the potentially detrimental effects of SREBP-1 on vascular functions, cell types and expression distribution of SREBP-1, along with eNOS and α-SM-actin, were determined by immunohistochemical staining of adjacent aortic sections at various stages of plaques. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067532-g007">Fig. 7</xref>, SREBP-1 was only detectable in endothelial cells (ECs), but not in other vascular cells, in the aorta of normal pigs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067532-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>).

Immunostaining for eNOS (an endothelial cell marker) showed impaired endothelium integrity in atherosclerotic lesions (<bold>C</bold>).

         <p>The expression of vascular inflammatory markers was assessed to further determine whether the elevation of SREBP-1 and NLRP3- and ASC-mediated production of IL-1β is pathologically relevant to vascular inflammatory process and endothelial dysfunction in atherosclerosis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067532-g006">Fig. 6F and G</xref>, expression of NF-κB was increased, and expression of eNOS was declined in atherosclerotic pig aorta.

Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis showed that the staining intensity of iNOS and COX-2, NF-κB-dependent genes, was primarily located in the endothelium of intimal lesions and within the fibrous lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067532-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>).

A robust increase in double positive staining for SREBP-1 and MAC-2 was also evident in macrophage-dense areas of intimal lesions and the subendothelial space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067532-g008">Fig. 8B, D, and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0067532.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>).

Positive staining for MAC-2 was predominantly located in the cytoplasm of macrophages within subendothelial lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067532-g008">Fig. 8D</xref>). Intriguingly, strongly positive staining of IL-1β was also observed in the endothelial and smooth muscle layers of intimal lesions in atherosclerotic pigs, comparable to that of SREBP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067532-g008">Fig. 8B, C and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0067532.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>), despite minimal staining for IL-1β in normal pigs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067532-g008">Fig. 8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0067532.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>).

These data indicate that inflammasome-mediated production of IL-1β is present not only in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells of intimal lesions but also in macrophage-enriched lesion areas. Together with elevated staining for SREBP-1 and IL-1β in multiple cell types of intimal lesions, these results support the notion that abnormally enhanced SREBP-1 and NLRP3-IL-1β signaling contributes to the dysfunction of endothelial and smooth muscle cells and the activation of macrophages, ultimately leading to the acceleration of plaque formation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The present study provides strong evidence that the integrated dysregulation of SIRT1-AMPK-SREBP pathway and elevation of NLRP3 inflammasome components in the vascular wall contribute significantly to early and advanced atherosclerotic development. The porcine model of diabetes and atherosclerosis exhibits complex lesion phenotypes including fatty streaks, fibrous caps, necrotic lipid cores, and deposition of cholesterol crystals. SREBP-1 positive cells are localized predominantly in eNOS-positive endothelial cells, MAC-2 positive macrophages, and VCAM-1-positive vascular cells within intimal lesions and cholesterol crystal-containing areas of advanced lesions. The improper SREBP activation in atherosclerotic pig aorta is evidenced by an increase in the proteolytic processing of SREBP-1 and -2 without significantly affecting their precursors, as well as an elevation of their target genes involved in <italic>de novo</italic> lipid synthesis. The induction of vascular lipid accumulation and inflammatory response is evidenced by the localization of either SREBP-1 or IL-1β in endothelial cells of inflamed intima and in MAC-2 positive macrophages of lipid-rich lesion areas, upregulation of NLRP3, ASC, and IL-1β, and activation of NF-κB-dependent genes, iNOS and COX-2. The pro-atherogenic effects of SREBP-1 and IL-1β may be implicated on endothelial cell dysfunction, macrophage activation, and smooth muscle cell proliferation within fibrous caps of advanced plaques. Moreover, SIRT1 and AMPK activities are substantially suppressed in atherosclerotic pig aorta. This dysregulation contributes to the aberrant activation of SREBP-1 probably through the impairment of deacetylation and phosphorylation of SREBP-1. Most importantly, the preclinical studies from diabetic individuals with coronary artery atherosclerosis also indicate that immunoreactivity of SREBP-1 is predominantly localized in VCAM-1-positive vascular cells and lipid-rich macrophages of the plaques. Although other factors such as the accumulation of oxidized LDL in macrophages have been implicated in the initiation of atherosclerosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Libby1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Bornfeldt1">[2]</xref>, the data presented here may suggest an attractive alternative model, in which the dysregulation of SIRT1-AMPK-SREBP signaling and elevation of NLRP3 inflammasome components result in vascular lipid deposit and elicit inflammatory process in atherosclerosis related to diabetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067532-g009">Fig. 9</xref>).</p>

            <title>The proposed model for the association of SREBP-mediated lipotoxic signaling with NLRP3 inflammasome in advanced atherosclerotic plaques during diabetes.</title>
            <p>Prolonged hyperglycemia causes the integrated suppression of arterial SIRT1 and AMPK in the development of atherosclerosis. This coordinated dysregulation may contribute to the repression in SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of SREBP-1 and inhibition in AMPK-dependent Ser-372 phosphorylation of SREBP-1, thereby leading to the proteolytic activation of SREBP-1. Consequently, aberrant activation of SREBP stimulates expression of its target genes involved in <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis, promotes the formation of cholesterol crystals, and accelerates more lipid deposit in the arterial wall. On the other hand, the induction of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is potentially triggered by sensing the toxic lipids, cholesterol crystals, and components of necrotic cells, possibly elicits caspase-1-dependent production of pro-atherogenic cytokine IL-1β. As a result, excess IL-1β production potentially activates vascular inflammatory response likely through the induction of NF-κB and its target genes such as VCAM-1 and iNOS, which ultimately causes eNOS reduction and vascular dysfunction. The inflammatory process may also promote the migration of smooth muscle cells from the media into the inflamed intima, contributing to the fibrous cap formation in advanced lesions. Collectively, activation of SREBP and elevation of NLRP3 inflammasome markers may explain much of complicated atherosclerotic characteristics, such as macrophage infiltration, endothelial cell dysfunction, smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation, deposition of cholesterol crystals, and formation of fibrous caps and necrotic cores.</p>

Furthermore, molecular and biochemical evidence indicates that SREBP activity is downregulated by SIRT1 and AMPK via two distinct mechanisms including SIRT1-dependent deacetylation of SREBP and AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of SREBP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Li1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Ponugoti1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Walker1">[32]</xref>. An additional important finding is that an increase in the cleavage processing of SREBP-1 and -2 and a parallel elevation in their target genes such as FAS, SCD1, GPAT1, and HMGCS are observed in atherosclerotic pigs. Immunostaining clearly demonstrate that unlike SREBP-1 only detected in endothelial cells of normal pig aorta, positive staining for SREBP-1 in early and progressive plaques is more intense in activated endothelial cells and macrophages, but to a lesser extent in smooth muscle cells. The most likely explanation is that the pro-atherogenic effect of SREBP-1 appears vascular endothelial cell-specific or macrophage-specific. In support of our findings, SREBP activity in endothelial cells is previously shown to be increased by atherogenic stimuli such as shear stress and oxidized phospholipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Lin1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Yeh1">[43]</xref>. The present study provides the <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that the upregulation of SREBP-1 may be a consequence of SIRT1 inhibition, which acts directly by diminishing SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of SREBP-1 and indirectly by repressing AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of SREBP-1 in atherosclerotic pigs, because pharmacological and genetic manipulation of SIRT1 can modulate AMPK signaling via LKB1 both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Hou1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Price1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Lan1">[44]</xref>.</p>
         <p>To determine whether SREBP is aberrantly altered in atherosclerosis, the study presented here suggests that SREBP likely plays a role in vascular lipid accumulation and inflammation during atherogenesis. First, SREBP-mediated lipotoxic signaling is elevated in the aortic atherosclerosis, which is possibly attributed to macrophage infiltration into the vascular wall of atherosclerosis. Second, the proteolytic processing of SREBP is highly active in atherosclerotic pig aorta. Because similar levels of SREBP-1 precursors are noted between control and atherosclerotic pig aorta, other regulators are possibly involved in the regulation of the proteolytic activation of SREBP during atherosclerosis. Further analysis also suggests that associated suppression of SIRT1 and AMPK may be implicated in impaired deacetylation and phosphorylation of SREBP-1, increased mature active form of SREBP-1, enhanced transcription of its target genes, and ultimately leads to excess lipid accumulation and deposit in arteries. Third, it raises the additional possibility that the abnormal activation of SREBP may ultimately lead to a potential vicious cycle of vascular lipid accumulation and inflammation in atherosclerosis. On account of the complexity of SREBP regulation, future studies will establish the mechanisms of cell type-specific effects of SREBP in atherosclerosis. Although we have established the role of SREBP in the porcine model of diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis, which nearly resembles the onset of human atherosclerosis, activation of SREBP may occur in human atherosclerosis under conditions of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, or both. Future clinical related studies are needed to investigate the impact of SREBP in atherosclerotic subjects with non-diabetes and diabetes.</p>

         <title>Stimulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome may contribute to vascular inflammatory response in the development of aortic atherosclerosis</title>
         <p>While chronic and low-grade inflammation, an important pathogenic process of diabetes and atherosclerosis, can be elicited by metabolic signals, how nutrient stresses such as hyperglycemia and lipotoxicity initiate and sustain inflammation in atherosclerotic plaques is not well understood. Therefore, defining the molecular triggers and the cellular sensors that drive inflammation is of therapeutic importance. Recent studies indicate that the mice lacking components of NLRP3 inflammasome display anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Duewell1">[7]</xref>. These mice are also protected against insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction during obesity-induced diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Vandanmagsar1">[8]</xref>, depicting that the NLRP3 inflammasome may function as a sensor that detects danger signals and provokes inflammatory reaction in these diseases. Studies by Im et al. have discovered that SREBP-1a deficiency in macrophages diminishes LPS-induced activation of lipogenesis and NLRP inflammasomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Im1">[11]</xref>. This translational study clearly indicates the increase in SREBP-1 occurs in atherosclerotic lesions in both pigs and humans. Because expression of VCAM-1 reflects an inflammatory state in human atherosclerosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Libby1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Bornfeldt1">[2]</xref>, the clinical relevance of elevated SREBP-1 to vascular inflammation is evidenced by overlapped staining of SREBP-1 with VCAM-1 in atherosclerotic plaques in humans. These changes are associated with an increase in NLRP3 inflammasome signaling, co-localization of IL-1β and MAC-2 (a macrophage marker), and an elevation of NF-κB and its responsive genes iNOS and COX-2 in lesion areas, leading to initiated and amplified vascular inflammation. Cholesterol crystal-induced NLRP3 inflammasome is thought to be required for IL-1β secretion in macrophages and <italic>in vivo</italic> atherogenesis in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Duewell1">[7]</xref>. The stimulation of SREBP-2-dependent cholesterol synthesis in atherosclerotic pig aorta may not only promote the formation of cholesterol crystals in advanced lesions but also potentially induce atherogenic inflammasomes. Considering that cells undergoing necrosis can also activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067532-Iyer1">[10]</xref>, it is possible that several danger signals of inflammasomes, such as SREBP-1-mediated lipotoxic signaling, undissolved cholesterol crystals, and ATP released from necrotic cells, are involved in NLRP3-mediated induction of IL-1β in atherosclerosis. To our knowledge, these studies with atherosclerotic pigs provide the first <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence suggesting that dysfunctional SIRT1-AMPK-SREBP pathway appears to be involved in the formation of cholesterol crystals, which may account for the stimulation of NLRP3 inflammasome in atherosclerosis.</p>
         <p>In conclusion, the present study uncovers a previously unrecognized role of SREBP in atherosclerosis and its functional association with NLRP3 inflammasome-driven inflammation. Such knowledge of improper SREBP-1 activity in human atherosclerosis has a potential prognostic and clinical implication for vascular lipid accumulation and inflammation. Because the integrated suppression of vascular SIRT1 and AMPK have an impact on activation of SREBP in arterial atherosclerosis, our findings highlight the rationale for targeting SIRT1-AMPK–SREBP signaling as a potential therapeutic treatment of human atherosclerosis.</p>
