				<p>Circulating triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TGRL) from hypertriglyceridemic subjects exacerbate endothelial inflammation and promote monocyte infiltration into the arterial wall. We have recently reported that TGRL isolated from human blood after a high-fat meal can elicit a pro- or anti-atherogenic state in human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC), defined as up- or down-regulation of VCAM-1 expression in response to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) stimulation, respectively. A direct correlation was found between subjects categorized at higher risk for cardiovascular disease based upon serum triglycerides and postprandial production of TGRL particles that increased VCAM-1-dependent monocyte adhesion to inflamed endothelium. To establish how TGRL metabolism is linked to VCAM-1 regulation, we examined endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways. Regardless of its atherogenicity, the rate and extent of TGRL internalization and lipid droplet formation by HAEC were uniform. However, pro-atherogenic TGRL exacerbated ER membrane expansion and stress following TNFα stimulation, whereas anti-atherogenic TGRL ameliorated such effects.  Inhibition of ER stress with a chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyric acid decreased TNFα-induced VCAM-1 expression and abrogated TGRL’s atherogenic effect. Activation of ER stress sensors PKR-like ER-regulated kinase (PERK) and inositol requiring protein 1α (IRE1α), and downstream effectors including eukaryotic initiation factor-2α (eIF2α), spliced X-box-binding protein 1 (sXBP1) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), directly correlated with the atherogenic activity of an individual’s TGRL. Modulation of ER stress sensors also correlated with changes in expression of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), a transcription factor of <italic>Vcam-1</italic> responsible for regulation of its expression. Moreover, knockdown studies using siRNA defined a causal relationship between the PERK/eIF2α/CHOP pathway and IRF-1-mediated VCAM-1 expression. We conclude that ER stress and the UPR contribute to the regulation of <italic>Vcam-1</italic> transcription as a function of the atherogenic nature of TGRL.</p>

			<title>Introduction</title>
			<p>The composition of circulating triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TGRL) in blood undergoes dynamic changes with an individual’s diet and lipid metabolism. TGRL consist of proteins and lipids, and their relative amounts and organization determine particle size and density. Particle composition in turn determines its residence time in circulation and the rate of uptake and transport across the endothelium, which directly impact atherogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Hypertriglyceridemia prevails in obese individuals and is directly correlated with the growing epidemic of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and increased risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. TGRL from hypertriglyceridemic subjects is thought to exacerbate endothelial inflammation and promote monocyte infiltration into the arterial wall, two early events in the formation of atherosclerotic lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Following consumption of a high-fat meal, hypertriglyceridemic subjects produced TGRL particles of larger diameter with increased content of apolipoprotein (Apo)CIII, cholesterol, and triglycerides, and a distinct fatty acid composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Uptake of these TGRL by human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) amplified upregulation of membrane vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), which correlated with an increase in shear resistant monocyte adhesion compared with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) stimulation alone. Conversely, TGRL with low triglyceride content exerted an athero-protective effect on HAEC, lowering VCAM-1 expression and the extent of monocyte recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].  A key question remains as to the origin of this heterogeneity in the inflammatory response to TGRL derived from individuals following a high-fat meal. Specifically, how does uptake and processing of TGRL by the various organelles in endothelial cells (EC) result in differential impact on signaling pathways that converge on a pro- <italic>versus</italic> anti-atherogenic response? </p>
			<p>TGRL and low density remnant particles are promptly taken up by EC via endocytosis through low density lipoprotein (LDL) family receptors, predominantly low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1) and LR11 (LDL receptor relative with 11 binding repeats) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Excess fatty acids and sterols released by lipoprotein metabolism are mainly converted to neutral lipids and packaged into lipid droplets (LD) for storage by endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Some metabolic intermediates ultimately enter ER synthesis pathways for phospholipids, a major component of ER and LD membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In addition to lipid metabolism, the ER plays a crucial role in protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Disruption of ER homeostasis leads to accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER lumen, a condition referred to as ER stress. This condition has emerged as a common signature of metabolic dysregulation as indicated by studies that link obesity to insulin resistance and inflammation in T2DM and CVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A high-fat diet in obese animal models and in obese humans induces marked elevation of ER stress in the liver and adipose tissues, as well as in atherosclerotic lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The mechanism is not entirely known, but is associated with prolonged activation of the ER stress pathway in response to oxidative stress, oxysterols, and elevated levels of intracellular cholesterol and saturated fatty acids in macrophages and endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Mitigation of ER stress with the chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) has proven effective in alleviating obesity-induced ER stress and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic mice, and in reducing atherosclerotic lesion progression in high-fat diet fed ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Still elusive is how the uptake and metabolism of native TGRL exerts a differential inflammatory effect on endothelium and whether ER stress contributes to its atherogenicity. </p>
			<p>Endothelial and other somatic cells have adapted mechanisms to mitigate ER stress and to maintain homeostasis known as the unfolded protein response (UPR), which involves dissociation of binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) from the three ER transmembrane sensor proteins, PKR-like ER-regulated kinase (PERK), inositol requiring protein 1α (IRE1α), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and their subsequent activation. These in turn activate downstream effectors, such as spliced X-box-binding protein 1 (sXBP1) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Apart from being a rescue mechanism under ER stress, some particular UPR pathways play a crucial role in the regulation of adipogenesis and EC inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. For example, the IRE1α-sXBP1 branch of the UPR mediates interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression by HAEC following activation with oxidized LDL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Another subarm of the UPR, the PERK-eukaryotic initiation factor-2α (eIF2α) pathway, is activated in animal models of obesity. Its downstream target CHOP is highly expressed in atherosclerotic plaques and reported to mediate ER stress-induced upregulation of inflammation and adhesion related proteins in macrophages and smooth muscle cells, in addition to its traditional pro-apoptotic role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Thus, a constellation of evidence points to UPR and ER stress being directly associated with the inflammatory axis of atherogenesis. Yet it is unknown whether and to what extent they are engaged in the modulation of endothelial inflammation as a function of an individual’s TGRL.</p>
			<p>We hypothesized that the relative capacity of TGRL to influence transcription and expression of VCAM-1 is a function of particle metabolism, in particular its influence on ER stress. Our objective was to investigate a role for ER stress in TGRL-modulated endothelial dysfunction using a model for hypertriglyceridemia. To that end, we assessed TGRL harvested from low- and high-risk subjects (e.g. based upon serum triglyceride level) fed a high-fat meal and examined ER stress and UPR signaling pathways in the transcriptional regulation of VCAM-1 expression following EC inflammation stimulated by TNFα. We demonstrate that native TGRL edits inflammatory VCAM-1 expression via UPR pathways.</p>

We categorized each subject’s postprandial TGRL based on its capacity to alter the inflammatory response of HAEC stimulated with TNFα, a pivotal inflammatory cytokine expressed locally at sites of atherosclerotic plaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and a biomarker for CVD that is found at elevated levels in the serum of individuals at increased risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The dose of TNFα in use (0.3 ng/ml) was previously reported to correspond to the EC<sub>50</sub> for upregulation of membrane adhesion receptors on HAEC (VCAM-1, ICAM-1, or E-selectin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. TGRL that enhanced VCAM-1 expression relative to TNFα stimulation alone was designated as pro-atherogenic and that which suppressed VCAM-1 expression as anti-atherogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Pro-atherogenic TGRL were enriched in triglyceride, cholesterol, ApoE, and ApoCIII content per particle as compared to anti-atherogenic that uniformly expressed lower levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078322.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
				<p>We next investigated whether the differential atherogenic response of HAEC to inflammatory stimulation was a function of the extent of TGRL uptake and subsequent lipid droplet (LD) formation. The internalization of fluorophore-conjugated TGRL particles increased rapidly upon addition to the EC monolayer and rose steadily up to 6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078322-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), while the uptake rate reached a steady state after 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078322-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, inset). Intracellular LD formation was visualized by confocal fluorescence microscopy of BODIPY stained EC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078322-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Discrete punctate BODIPY-positive droplets measuring ~0.1-0.5 micrometer in diameter were resolved in HAEC cytoplasm. To determine whether the rate and extent of LD formation correlated with TGRL atherogenicity, we quantified their cytoplasmic abundance using flow cytometry. LD formation increased with a time course similar to that of TGRL uptake at a rate that plateaued at 2 hr and maintained a steady state up to 5 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078322-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, inset). LD abundance in TGRL treated HAEC was increased by ~6-fold at 4 hr with no significant difference observed in the extent of LD formation between anti- and pro-atherogenic TGRL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078322-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), which decreased VCAM-1 expression by 10 ± 2 %, and increased it by 29 ± 7 %, respectively, compared to TNFα alone. Noteworthy was the observation that the extent of LD formation as measured by BODIPY fluorescence correlated closely with the side scatter (SSC) signal obtained by flow cytometry (r = 0.94, P &lt; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078322.s002">Figure S2</xref>), suggesting that SSC provides a simple label-free approach to assess LD abundance in EC. Together, these data demonstrate a rapid and sustained TGRL uptake that results in the extensive formation of LD in the cytoplasm of HAEC.  Heterogeneity of particle size and composition that discriminated anti- from pro-atherogenic TGRL did not result in a discernible difference in the extent of LD formation. We conclude that the relative atherogenicity of TGRL on HAEC is not simply a function of its relative abundance or extent of cytoplasmic internalization.</p>

				<title>TGRL atherogenicity is reflected in ER morphological changes associated with ER stress</title><p>Excess fatty acids and sterols released from lipoproteins are mainly converted to neutral lipids and stored in LD by a series of ER-resident enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. We next examined whether the atherogenic phenotype induced by uptake and metabolism of individual TGRL was reflected in alteration of ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].

To investigate if the metabolic challenge induced by TGRL uptake and subsequent LD formation effectively disrupts ER function, we examined ER morphology after 4 hr incubation with pro- or anti-atherogenic TGRL or control media in the presence of TNFα stimulation. HAEC ER morphology was imaged by confocal microscopy and immunofluorescence staining of calreticulin, an ER luminal resident protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Image analysis revealed a significant extent of ER membrane expansion in HAEC treated with pro-atherogenic TGRL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078322-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), similar to that previously reported following skeletal muscle uptake of saturated fatty acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. ER membrane expansion was characterized by an increase in tubular and web structures with a significant 33% increase in the spatial heterogeneity of labeled calreticulin in HAEC treated with pro-atherogenic TGRL and stimulated with TNFα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078322-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, anti-atherogenic TGRL suppressed ER expansion by 14%. To test whether ER stress was associated with the differential effects of pro- <italic>versus</italic> anti-atherogenic TGRL, we examined ER membrane alteration in the presence of the ER stress inhibitor, 4-phenyl butyric acid (4-PBA). Treatment with 4-PBA abrogated the effect of pro-atherogenic TGRL on ER expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078322-g002">Figure 2C-D</xref>). Further, we confirmed that TNFα itself did not cause obvious morphological changes compared to control cells; however, treatment of HAEC with pro-atherogenic TGRL alone induced a significant increase in ER expansion that was augmented upon TNFα stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078322.s003">Figure S3</xref>). These data demonstrate that ER membrane morphology provides a reliable readout of the relative effects of TGRL and suggest that ER stress may directly influence downstream inflammatory responses of HAEC. </p>

				<title>ER stress plays a key role in TNFα and TGRL modulation of VCAM-1 expression</title>
				<p>The distinct alterations of ER morphology by pro- and anti-atherogenic TGRL led us to further investigate whether inhibition of ER stress with 4-PBA would alter TNFα-stimulated upregulation of adhesion receptor expression. Treatment of HAEC with 4-PBA significantly inhibited VCAM-1 upregulation in a dose-dependent manner, yielding an IC<sub>50</sub> of 2mM and ~70% inhibition at 3mM 4-PBA following 4 hrs of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078322-g003">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078322.s004">Figure S4 A-B</xref>). In contrast, 4-PBA did not affect ICAM-1 upregulation within this dose range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078322-g003">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078322.s004">Figure S4 C-D</xref>). Similar results were observed for regulation of mRNA production at the 2 hr time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078322-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). This suggested that ER stress was modulating a VCAM-1-specific regulatory pathway. To determine whether inhibition of ER stress also modulated the atherogenic effect of TGRL on VCAM-1 expression, HAEC were treated with pro- or anti-atherogenic TGRL and stimulated with TNFα in the presence or absence of 4-PBA. Suppression of ER stress by 4-PBA abrogated the pro-atherogenic effect of TGRL in regulating TNFα-stimulated VCAM-1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078322-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).

				<title>TGRL modulates VCAM-1 expression through activation of ER stress</title><p>We next investigated the ER stress signaling pathways that may contribute to the atherogenic effect of TGRL specifically on VCAM-1 expression. We first measured changes in BiP protein expression and the phosphorylation of IRE1α (Ser<sup>724</sup>) and eIF2α (Ser<sup>51</sup>), adjusted for their relative levels of protein expression. Western immunoblotting revealed that TNFα at 0.3 ng/ml elicited 80% upregulation of BiP expression and 50% of IRE1α phosphorylation over baseline, which equals 42% and 58% of the elevation by TNFα at 10 ng/ml (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078322.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Pro-atherogenic TGRL on average upregulated BiP expression by ~80% and increased the phosphorylation of both IRE1α (35%) and eIF2α (15%) from the modest effect of TNFα alone, whereas anti-atherogenic TGRL had comparatively less of an effect on BiP and IRE1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078322-g004">Figure 4A-C</xref>). Further, a significant direct correlation was observed in activity of all three ER stress markers <italic>versus</italic> regulation of VCAM-1 expression elicited by treatment with each subject’s TGRL relative to TNFα alone. To better understand the effect of TGRL on downstream mediators of ER stress we assessed activation of sXBP1 and CHOP. Baseline expression of sXBP1 protein was detected at low levels and not significantly elevated by treatment with TGRL alone. TNFα stimulation significantly increased the level of sXBP1, which was further elevated by pro-atherogenic TGRL (15%) and decreased by anti-atherogenic TGRL (63%) relative to TNFα stimulation alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078322-g004">Figure 4D</xref>).  In contrast, baseline expression of CHOP was increased by 80% following treatment with pro-atherogenic TGRL, but remained unchanged in response to anti-atherogenic TGRL. TNFα stimulation alone increased CHOP expression by 3-fold and this rise was suppressed by anti-atherogenic TGRL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078322-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Both sXBP1 and CHOP levels significantly correlated with regulation of VCAM-1 expression elicited by treatment with each subject’s TGRL compared to TNFα alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078322.s006">Figure S6</xref>).  As expected, inhibition with 4-PBA down regulated cytokine activation of ER stress as indicated by an attenuated phosphorylation of IRE1α and reduced expression of CHOP and sXBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078322-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). These results indicate that ER stress and activation of the UPR is directly influenced by stimulation with TNFα and its activity further modulates VCAM-1 expression as a function of the relative atherogenicity of TGRL. </p>

				<title>IRF-1-regulation of VCAM-1 expression correlates with TGRL-induced ER stress response</title><p>To connect TGRL-modulated ER stress pathways to altered VCAM-1 expression, we analyzed changes in the expression of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) with concomitant changes in ER stress markers over a range in activity from anti- to pro-atherogenic. The motivation for this set of experiments was our recent report that IRF-1 parallels inflammatory changes in VCAM-1 expression as a function of the atherogenicity of a subject’s TGRL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Moreover, studies with siRNA have revealed that IRF-1 activity directly correlated with the up or down modulation of TGRL on VCAM-1 expression by regulating <italic>Vcam-1</italic> transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In the current cohort, we confirmed that IRF-1 expression strongly correlated with regulation of VCAM-1 expression in response to TGRL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078322.s007">Figure S7 A</xref>). Like VCAM-1 expression, IRF-1 protein levels in HAEC were directly and significantly correlated with IRE1α and eIF2α phosphorylation as modulated by TGRL from our subject pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078322-g005">Figure 5A-B</xref>). TGRL that promoted sXBP1 upregulation by 20% and CHOP by 24% in response to TNFα, increased IRF-1 expression on average by 23%. Conversely, TGRL that suppressed sXBP1 upregulation by 63% and CHOP by 43%, reduced IRF-1 expression by 28%. The specificity in regulation of IRF-1 was assessed by pretreatment of HAEC over a dose range of 4-PBA, which revealed a decrease in TNFα-stimulated IRF-1 protein expression stimulated with TNFα for 4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078322-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Similar to inhibition of VCAM-1, we detected an IC<sub>50</sub> of ~1 mM and maximal suppression of IRF-1 protein production of 60% above 3mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078322-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Consistently, pretreatment of cells with 4-PBA at 1 mM significantly inhibited <italic>Irf-1</italic> transcription at 1 hr post stimulation with TNFα (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078322.s008">Figure S8</xref>). Depletion of IRF-1 with siRNA decreased TNFα-induced VCAM-1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078322.s007">Figure S7 B-C</xref>). In contrast, activation of NF-κB and AP-1, two other transcription factors of <italic>Vcam-1</italic> that are activated by TNFα stimulation, was not affected by 4-PBA up to doses of 1 mM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078322.s009">Figure S9</xref>). This is consistent with our observation that ICAM-1 expression, which is primarily regulated by NF-κB and AP-1, is not significantly altered by 4-PBA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078322-g003">Figure 3A-B</xref>).

			<title>Discussion</title>
			<p>To elucidate the mechanisms that contribute to the relative atherogenicity of lipoproteins in the circulation of individuals who consume a standard high-fat meal, we exposed endothelial cells derived from human aortas to isolated postprandial TGRL.  Using this model, we recently reported that TGRL from hypertriglyceridemic subjects exerted a pro-atherogenic effect on HAEC based upon its capacity to up-regulate VCAM-1 expression during inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In contrast, subjects with normal triglycerides produced postprandial TGRL that elicited a significant decrease in TNFα-induced VCAM-1 on HAEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Editing of VCAM-1 expression by TGRL was precisely controlled at the transcriptional level by IRF-1 and was of sufficient magnitude to significantly alter monocyte adhesion to HAEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In the current study we show that perturbation of ER function plays a central role in the modulation of VCAM-1 expression by TGRL. A direct correlation was measured between ER stress markers and the regulation of VCAM-1 in response to TGRL. Relief of ER stress with the pharmacological inhibitor 4-PBA abrogated the pro-atherogenic effect of TGRL by inhibiting IRF-1. Specifically, the anti-atherogenic effect of TGRL was recapitulated by depletion of UPR downstream effector CHOP, but not sXBP1. These data are the first to demonstrate the modulation of ER stress by native TGRL in EC and reveal that dietary lipids can differentially regulate the kinetics of TNFα-induced VCAM-1 expression at least in part through ER stress signaling and downstream pathways. </p>
			<p>VCAM-1 is typically expressed at undetectable levels on confluent monolayers of HAEC in tissue culture and treatment with TGRL alone does not elicit its upregulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, the inflammatory response of HAEC to TNFα was modulated by treatment with postprandial TGRL and its atherogenic effect was recently reported to increase with particle density of cholesterol, triglycerides, ApoE and ApoCIII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In the current study, we observed that TGRL uptake and the extent of LD formation was independent of TGRL atherogenicity. In light of our previous report that pro- and anti-atherogenic TGRL are composed of distinct distributions of fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], these data suggest that the fatty acid and apolipoprotein content of TGRL and its metabolism in the ER are in part responsible for its distinct effects on inflammation. Following internalization, fatty acids and sterols from TGRL metabolism is converted to neutral lipids and stored in LD. In addition, fatty acids released from TGRL may influence ER biosynthesis of phospholipids and be incorporated into ER and LD membranes. The level of induction of ER stress appears to be related to the nature of the lipid species. Fatty acid chain length, level of unsaturation, position of double bonds, and the cis <italic>versus</italic> trans nature of the isomers, can all affect lipid-induced disruption of ER homeostasis and chronic ER stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].  For example, saturated fatty acids (SFA) such as palmitic acid can distort the composition of lipids constituting the ER membrane thereby inducing ER swelling and expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In contrast, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), such as oleic acid, do not induce ER stress, but are able to alleviate and reverse ER expansion and ER stress induced by SFA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p>
			<p>We observed that TNFα stimulation alone induced from ~50% to 3-fold increase in BiP expression, IRE1α and eIF2α phosphorylation, and downstream effectors, sXBP1 and CHOP. Inhibition of TNFα-induced ER stress with 4-PBA suppressed VCAM-1 expression without affecting ICAM-1 expression, suggesting a specific regulatory role of ER stress in VCAM-1 upregulation. A noteworthy observation is that treatment with pro-atherogenic TGRL alone induced ER expansion, albeit to a lesser extent than when combined with TNFα stimulation. Yet such perturbation of ER did not result in significant elevation of all ER stress markers; only CHOP expression registered a significant 1-fold increase compared to untreated control. This is consistent with CHOP being highly inducible in response to ER stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and suggests that pro-atherogenic TGRL itself may prime HAEC for an ER stress susceptive state. </p>
			<p>UPR signaling consists of three branches that are initiated by the ER transmembrane protein sensors: IRE1α, PERK and ATF6. Activation of ER stress sensors leads to the transcription of UPR target genes through their proximal downstream effectors, such as sXBP1, the translation initiation factor eIF2α, CHOP, and p50-ATF6. Our studies reveal that IRE1α-sXBP1 and PERK-eIF2α are two UPR branches that correlated closely with TGRL’s effect on VCAM-1 upregulation. Phosphorylated IRE1α removes a 26-base intron from XBP1 mRNA, yielding the active transcription factor, sXBP1. Although we observed that the extent of IRE1α phosphorylation and sXBP1 expression correlated directly with the relative change in VCAM-1 expression for a given pro- or anti-atherogenic TGRL, we failed to establish a causal relationship between sXBP1 and VCAM-1 expression. Knockdown of sXBP1 that greatly suppressed TNFα-induced VCAM-1 in bone marrow stromal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] caused no obvious reduction in TNFα-induced endothelial VCAM-1 upregulation in our study. This discrepancy may suggest specific regulation of ER stress in different cell types.  Another transcription factor induced during ER stress is CHOP, which has been reported to mediate apoptosis induction under ER stress and play a role in atherogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. It was reported that CHOP deficiency markedly suppressed expression of inflammation and adhesion related proteins including VCAM-1, IL-6, IL-1β, and MCP-1 in macrophages, EC and smooth muscle cells, and significantly reduced atherosclerotic plaque formation in high-fat diet fed ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In addition, deletion of CHOP in a murine model of inflammatory bowel disease significantly lowered mRNA expression of VCAM-1 and CD11b compared with wild type mice, but had no effect on expression of other adhesion molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In line with these results, we found anti-atherogenic TGRL significantly suppressed CHOP expression induced by TNFα. Moreover, specific knockdown of CHOP mimicked the effect observed in anti-atherogenic TGRL on VCAM-1 expression.</p>
			<p>It was previously reported that IRF-1 functioned as a specific transcriptional regulator of VCAM-1 expression in response to TGRL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].  The current dataset confirmed that IRF-1 protein level strongly correlated with the regulation of VCAM-1 expression by TGRL. Moreover, IRF-1 expression directly correlated with TGRL-modulated eIF2α phosphorylation and was specifically regulated by the downstream effector CHOP, indicating that the PERK-eIF2α-CHOP pathway is involved in IRF-1 regulation. To analyze a link between this pathway and VCAM-1 transcription, we performed an <italic>in silico</italic> bioinformatics analysis of transcription factor binding sites on the promoter region of <italic>Irf-1</italic> using MatInspector from Genomatix. This revealed two putative CHOP binding sites. Analysis of the <italic>Vcam-1</italic> promoter region also revealed two putative CHOP sites. These findings suggest that CHOP may regulate VCAM-1 expression by altering IRF-1 transcription or by directly binding to the <italic>Vcam-1</italic> promoter region. While the results that 4-PBA decreases IRF-1 and VCAM-1 transcription support this possibility, future experimental analysis of CHOP binding to IRF-1 and VCAM-1 promoters using a CHiP assay will be necessary to elucidate the transcriptional mechanisms that function downstream of UPR pathways.</p>
			<p>In summary, we reveal a putative mechanism by which dietary lipids can modulate inflammatory activation of VCAM-1 expression on HAEC through regulation of ER stress and UPR pathways. A systematic analysis of IRE1α, PERK/eIF2α and the proximal effector CHOP, reveal a close correlation with IRF-1 expression, which is known to regulate VCAM-1 as a function of TGRL atherogenicity. Specific knockdown with siRNA further suggest an important role of the PERK/eIF2α/CHOP pathway in IRF-1-mediated VCAM-1 expression. Inhibition of ER stress with 4-PBA greatly suppressed the increased VCAM-1 expression induced by pro-atherogenic TGRL, but only moderately lowered TGRL’s anti-atherogenic activity, suggesting that therapeutics targeting ER stress may provide efficacious treatment of atherosclerosis.</p>
