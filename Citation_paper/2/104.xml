<abstract>
<p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, a pathogen infecting one third of the world population, faces numerous challenges within the host, including high levels of copper. We have previously shown that <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> CsoR is a copper inducible transcriptional regulator. Here we examined the hypothesis that <italic>csoR</italic> is necessary for maintaining copper homeostasis and surviving under various stress conditions. With an unmarked <italic>csoR</italic> knockout strain, we were able to characterize the role of <italic>csoR</italic> in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> as it faced copper and host stress. Growth under high levels of copper demonstrated that <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> survives copper stress significantly better in the absence of <italic>csoR</italic>. Yet under minimal levels of copper, differential expression analysis revealed that the loss of <italic>csoR</italic> results in a cell wide hypoxia-type stress response with the induction of the DosR regulon. Despite the stress placed on <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> by the loss of <italic>csoR</italic>, survival of the knockout strain was increased compared to wild type during the early chronic stages of mouse infection, suggesting that <italic>csoR</italic> could play an active role in modulating <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> fitness within the host. Overall, analysis of CsoR provided an increased understanding of the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> copper response with implications for other intracellular pathogens harboring CsoR.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> is one of the world’s most successful bacterial pathogens, infecting approximately one third of the human population. Despite widespread vaccination and the existence of antibiotic therapies, this causative agent of tuberculosis leads to over 1 million deaths each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref001">1</xref>]. Part of the success of this pathogen is attributed to its ability to quickly adapt and survive within harsh host microenvironments. The stress conditions <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> must face within the host include reactive nitrogen and oxygen species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref002">2</xref>], low pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref003">3</xref>], and hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref004">4</xref>]. Recently, copper has been recognized as an additional weapon in the host macrophage’s arsenal as it localizes high levels of copper to the mycobacterial phagosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref005">5</xref>]. This finding led our group to investigate the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> response to copper stress revealing a set of 30 genes responsive to copper and the damage it can cause [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref006">6</xref>]. Among these genes were two that encode for copper-responsive transcriptional repressors–paralogs now identified as <italic>ricR</italic> and <italic>csoR</italic>–the latter of which we continue to characterize in this report.</p>
<p>The bactericidal capabilities of copper have been known for some time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref007">7</xref>]. The mechanisms of copper damage include production of oxidative stress through Fenton reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref008">8</xref>], displacing metal cofactors in proteins, and destabilization of Fe-S clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref009">9</xref>]. Indeed, high physiological levels of copper have been demonstrated to be bactericidal for <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref006">6</xref>]. Conversely, copper serves as a cofactor of metalloenzymes and is necessary in trace amounts for various cellular activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref010">10</xref>]. In <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> such metalloenzymes include cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase and superoxide dismutase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref011">11</xref>], thus the role of copper in metabolism and the copper stress response must be carefully regulated. For example, under hypoxic conditions, which increase copper toxicity, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> makes use of copper-independent cytochrome <italic>bd</italic> oxidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref012">12</xref>]. This effectively reduces the requirement for cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase, and therefore copper, under conditions where copper poses the greatest threat to the cell.</p>
<p>To better understand how the copper stress response is managed, we began to characterize one <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> copper-induced regulator, CsoR. The crystal structure of CsoR revealed that the protein forms a homodimer with each monomer binding one molar equivalent of Cu(I) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref013">13</xref>]. In its apo form, CsoR binds the promoter of its own copper-sensitive operon (<italic>cso</italic>), however upon binding copper, repression is released inducing expression of the <italic>cso</italic> in a graduated manner leading to the export of copper ions. Here we investigated the importance of the negative regulatory role of <italic>csoR</italic> in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> copper homeostasis. Our initial results, examining the Δ<italic>csoR</italic> strain under copper stress and during early chronic murine infection, suggested that under certain conditions <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> may have an advantage upon suppressing the expression of <italic>csoR</italic>. Closer examination of the transcriptome of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> lacking <italic>csoR</italic>, however, revealed a hypoxic stress response during growth in copper-free media. This response may have better prepared the bacilli for survival during the early chronic stage of murine infection. We expect that <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> must strike a balance when it comes to handling copper stress and that CsoR is integral, though perhaps not alone, in this role. Furthermore, in this role CsoR may make an important contribution during entry to the chronic phase of tuberculosis.</p>

<title>Generation of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis csoR</italic> constructs</title>
<p>To create a knockout mutant of <italic>csoR</italic> in the virulent, wild type <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> strain H37Rv, homologous recombination was used to replace 5 base pairs (bp) of the 360bp coding region of <italic>csoR</italic> with a hygromycin resistance cassette (<italic>hyg</italic><sub><italic>R</italic></sub>), an ~2.4kB region, using the cosmid pYUB854 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151816.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref014">14</xref>]. The mutant was confirmed by sequencing and with Southern blot, which showed a 2.4kB shift between bands from wild type or mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151816.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). However, reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) testing for expression of the downstream genes revealed loss of transcription of all three downstream genes in the <italic>cso</italic>: Rv0968, a conserved hypothetical protein; <italic>ctpV</italic>, coding for a copper-exporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref015">15</xref>]; and Rv0970, a conserved membrane protein of unknown function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151816.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). In order to create a nonpolar Δ<italic>csoR</italic> strain, an additional step was taken to remove the hygromycin cassette. The vector pYUB870 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref014">14</xref>] was electroporated into Δ<italic>csoR</italic>::<italic>hyg</italic><sub><italic>R</italic></sub> removing <italic>hyg</italic><sub><italic>R</italic></sub> and leaving behind a 150 bp insertion sequence at the 14<sup>th</sup> codon of <italic>csoR</italic>. The resulting unmarked mutation led to a frame shift which introduced 6 stop codons either at the insertion site or within the remainder of the <italic>csoR</italic> gene. RT-PCR results confirmed transcription of the remaining members of the <italic>cso</italic> in the unmarked mutant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151816.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). A complementation strain, Δ<italic>csoR</italic>::<italic>csoR</italic>, was constructed by incorporating <italic>csoR</italic> under its own promoter into the Δ<italic>csoR</italic> genome using the integrative vector pMV306.</p>

<p>To ensure that no other possible disruptions of the genome in or outside of the <italic>cso</italic> were contributing to the examined phenotypes, whole genome sequencing was carried out comparing <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> Δ<italic>csoR</italic> with its wild type H37Rv parent strain. A total of 95 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> Δ<italic>csoR</italic> when compared to the published H37Rv reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref016">16</xref>]. Of these, 38 SNPs corresponded to those identified as sequencing errors in the original reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref017">17</xref>] and 49 of the remaining SNPs were found in the sequenced parent strain. In all 8 unique SNPs were found in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> Δ<italic>csoR</italic> differentiating it from the parent strain. Two of these SNPs had been previously identified as they were annotated at the start of the insertion sequence in <italic>csoR</italic>. Five of the other six SNPs were found to be non-synonymous. One SNP each was found in PPE5 (Rv0304c) and PPE55 (Rv3347c). Three more, including the one synonymous SNP, were found in PE_PGRS9 (Rv0746). The last was found in a probable cyclase, Rv2435c. When <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> Δ<italic>csoR</italic> was searched for larger genomic variations, only the 150bp scar at the <italic>csoR</italic> deletion site was identified. Given the distance of these variations from the <italic>cso</italic> and the function of the genes they target, it seems unlikely that the observed phenotypes could be due to anything other than the deletion of <italic>csoR</italic>.</p>

<title>Survival of Δ<italic>csoR</italic> is enhanced under copper stress</title>
<p>To test the growth kinetics of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> Δ<italic>csoR</italic> during copper stress, wild type and mutant strains were grown in copper-free Sauton’s liquid media with no added copper or with 50 or 500μM CuCl<sub>2</sub>. As expected, both strains showed similar levels of growth in untreated cultures suggesting no generalized growth defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151816.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), and showed a decline in growth in the presence of 500μM CuCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151816.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). While the gradual decline of the <italic>ΔcsoR</italic> strain in 500μM CuCl<sub>2</sub> was similar to wild type at early time points, by day 15 the culture of the knockout strain maintained its total CFU/ml while the wild type culture continued to decline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151816.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). The difference at this time point was significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002) and observed across two separate experiments. Growth of the two strains in 50μM CuCl<sub>2</sub> did not vary from that of untreated cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0151816.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>To investigate the possibility that <italic>csoR</italic> and its regulon may play a greater role during later stages of growth as the culture transfers into stationary phase, the growth curves were repeated inoculating from cultures that had reached stationary phase, rather than from actively growing cultures as was done above. Interestingly, the difference in survival between <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> wild type and <italic>ΔcsoR</italic>, while not affected in untreated cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151816.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), differed dramatically in the presence of 500μM CuCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151816.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). This difference was noted after day 4 when wild type survival fell two logs lower than the mutant. By day 8 it remained near the limit of detection, 10 CFU/ml, while <italic>ΔcsoR</italic> survival declined much more gradually, remaining above 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/ml through day 15, indicating the ability of <italic>ΔcsoR</italic> to adapt to increased Cu levels.</p>
<p>After testing survival under two concentrations of copper, we sought to investigate the impact of copper on the growth of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> Δ<italic>csoR</italic> at a higher resolution. This was done by employing a modified microplate Alamar blue assay (MABA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref019">19</xref>]. Growth inhibition of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> wild type H37Rv, <italic>ΔcsoR</italic>, and Δ<italic>csoR</italic>::<italic>csoR</italic> by two-fold dilutions of CuCl<sub>2</sub> ranging from 16μM to 4000μM was tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0151816.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Microplates were inoculated with cultures growing at mid-log phase and read after approximately 10 days of growth. Susceptibility of both wild type and complement strains was equivalent, both showing a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 250μM CuCl<sub>2</sub>. The mutant, on the other hand, showed an MIC of 500μM CuCl<sub>2</sub>. These data confirmed the idea that loss of <italic>csoR</italic> improves survival of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> under copper stress.</p>

<sec id="sec005">
<title>Absence of <italic>csoR</italic> improves survival of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> during the early stages of chronic infection</title>
<p>To gain a broader understanding of the role of <italic>csoR</italic> during <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection, BALB/c mice were infected with H37Rv wild type or Δ<italic>csoR</italic> by aerosol infection. The groups infected with wild type received on average 370 CFU per animal while Δ<italic>csoR</italic> infected mice received closer to 1500 CFU per animal; however this difference in inoculum did not reach significance. In fact, by week 2 Δ<italic>csoR</italic> showed on average slightly less colonization than wild type. Despite this early trend, by weeks 4 and 8 Δ<italic>csoR</italic> showed a significant increase in survival compared to wild type (<italic>P</italic> = 0.015 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.005 respectively). This increase, however, was not sustained long term, as by week 25 no significant difference in survival between wild type and knockout was apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151816.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). While the colonization of the wild type strain was consistent from week 8 to week 25, Δ<italic>csoR</italic> showed a significant drop from week 8 to week 25 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.007), suggesting that the improved growth rate during early chronic stage was not sustainable throughout the duration of chronic infection. Unlike the lungs, no significant difference in survival was seen between wild type and Δ<italic>csoR</italic> when spleen and liver were assayed, although mean CFU/g were consistently higher in the mutant strain in both organs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0151816.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Body weight of the mice did not vary significantly between groups after week 2 of the experiment, when mice infected with ΔcsoR were on average 1.2g lighter than those infected with wild type (P = 0.005) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0151816.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Histopathology of the lungs, spleen, and liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151816.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) was scored by a trained pathologist. For both strains, lymphocytic infiltration and granulomatous reaction in the lungs worsened as the infection progressed, while minimal pathology was seen in the spleen and liver. No significant difference was noted between strains at any time point for any of the tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0151816.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). In sum, <italic>csoR</italic> conferred a moderate disadvantage to wild type <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> during the early weeks of murine infection, but may be required for long term survival.</p>

<title>The global transcriptional response of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> Δ<italic>csoR</italic></title>
<p>To better understand the breadth of influence <italic>csoR</italic> has directly as a regulator, and indirectly over copper homeostasis within the cell, the Δ<italic>csoR</italic> transcriptome was interrogated and compared to that of wild type <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv using RNA-Seq analysis. Our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref013">13</xref>] and that concerning <italic>csoR</italic> in other species such as <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref020">20</xref>] has suggested that under copper stress CsoR derepresses its regulon, and therefore few transcriptional differences between wild type and <italic>csoR</italic> knockout strains would be noted when compared under copper stress. Thus, we compared the transcriptomes of both wild type <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> and Δ<italic>csoR</italic> grown in copper-free Sauton’s media. Details of the number of reads and how they mapped can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0151816.s008">S1 Table</xref>. Differential expression analysis using strict cutoffs requiring differentially expressed genes to have a fold change ≥ |2.0| and a false discovery rate (FDR) of ≤ 0.05 left us with 223 genes that were significantly, differentially expressed between the mutant and wild type strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0151816.s009">S2 Table</xref>). Of those genes 152 were induced, while 71 were repressed in Δ<italic>csoR</italic> compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151816.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). To confirm these results, 10 genes were selected– 6 induced and 4 repressed–for quantitative, real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). All 10 were confirmed to be induced or repressed in the same direction, and with similar magnitude as the RNA-Seq data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0151816.s005">S5 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>It has already been established by our group and others that <italic>csoR</italic> represses its own operon in the absence of copper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref021">21</xref>]. Therefore, we first looked at the expression levels of the <italic>cso</italic>. As expected under low levels of copper, the <italic>cso</italic> was moderately induced in the Δ<italic>csoR</italic> strain as compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151816.g004">Fig 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0151816.t001">Table 1</xref>). This included the observed induction of <italic>csoR</italic> itself as sufficient remnants of the mutated <italic>csoR</italic> gene remained for successful RNA-Seq analysis. As CsoR is an established copper-responsive regulator, the list of differentially expressed genes in Δ<italic>csoR</italic> compared to wild type was interrogated for the 30 genes known to be responsive to copper in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> as determined by previous microarray analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref006">6</xref>]. Very few genes overlapped; in fact, the only overlapping gene outside of the <italic>cso</italic>, Rv0848, was repressed in the Δ<italic>csoR</italic> strain despite being induced under copper stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151816.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0151816.t001">Table 1</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>csoR</italic> may indeed only directly control expression of its own operon as previously suggested by Festa, <italic>et al</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref021">21</xref>]. While no significant changes in the majority of copper responsive genes were noted, most outside the <italic>cso</italic> (n = 18) were down regulated, short of our cutoff values. These include another copper sensing regulator, <italic>ricR</italic> (-1.5, FDR = 0.18). Among the RicR regulon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref021">21</xref>], two genes, Rv0847 and Rv0848, were significantly repressed. Additionally, several of the other genes under the control of RicR (n = 7), including <italic>mymT</italic> a copper binding metallothionein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref022">22</xref>] and <italic>mmcO</italic>, a multicopper oxidase which is exported across the cytoplasmic membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref023">23</xref>], were slightly, though not significantly down regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151816.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), and this trend was also confirmed by qRT-PCR. These results clearly demonstrate that the CsoR and RicR regulons are distinct; however deregulation of the CsoR regulon may contribute to a slight, perhaps compensatory, increase in repression of the RicR regulon.</p>

<p>With evidence that CsoR directly regulates only its own operon, it seemed likely that other forms of regulation were at play in the Δ<italic>csoR</italic> strain. While no sigma factors were found to be differentially expressed, numerous transcriptional regulators were among those differentially expressed (n = 16) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0151816.t001">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, the genes under transcriptional control of these regulators may represent a significant portion of the differentially expressed genes in our dataset. One striking pattern was the induction of 44 out of 48 members of the <italic>dosR</italic> regulon, known for its role in response to hypoxia, nitric oxide, and dormancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref025">25</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151816.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). These members of the <italic>dosR</italic> regulon were among the most highly induced genes in our dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151816.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Another notable regulator involved in broad regulation of genes throughout various stages of hypoxia, Rv0081, was also induced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref026">26</xref>]. This again suggests that <italic>csoR</italic> itself may not be directly controlling the expression of these genes, but rather derepression of its own regulon may be creating hypoxia-like stress conditions to which <italic>dosR</italic>, Rv0081, and other transcriptional regulators respond. Overall, our analyses suggest that CsoR represses its own operon, and absence of <italic>csoR</italic> may lead to a disruption in copper homeostasis, leading to a hypoxia or NO type stress response.</p>

<title>The impact of CsoR on drug resistance</title>
<p>During analysis of the <italic>csoR</italic> impacted genes it was noted that genes involved in the response to isoniazid (INH) were enriched, with 7 of the 23 known responders being induced. These 7 genes included several genes involved in fatty acid synthesis as well as membrane efflux protein, <italic>efpA</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0151816.t001">Table 1</xref>). Based on this finding and a previous study that showed the absence of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> copper-responsive regulator GfcR increased INH resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref027">27</xref>], we decided to investigate this phenotype in our mutant strain.

It may be that the induced INH responsive genes are responsive to more general stress conditions, and therefore are not those most relevant for mitigating INH related stress.</p>

<title>Expression dynamics of the copper sensing operon in the absence of <italic>csoR</italic> during copper stress</title>
<p>While we have shown that the <italic>cso</italic> is induced in the absence of <italic>csoR</italic> and copper stress, it is still unclear if CsoR deregulation alone accounts for the induction of the <italic>cso</italic> under copper stress. To better examine the dynamics of CsoR regulation of the <italic>cso</italic> during copper stress, we utilized qRT-PCR to profile the expression levels of <italic>csoR</italic>, Rv0968, <italic>ctpV</italic>, and Rv0970. Samples for analysis were taken from <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv, <italic>ΔcsoR</italic>, and <italic>ΔcsoR</italic>::<italic>csoR</italic> left untreated or exposed to either 50 or 500μM CuCl<sub>2</sub> for 3 hours. As expected, qRT-PCR analysis of all 4 <italic>cso</italic> genes showed induction of the operon in the absence of <italic>csoR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151816.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). This level of induction was on par with the induction of the operon under moderate copper stress (50μM CuCl<sub>2</sub>) in the wild type strain, but was less than the expression levels seen in wild type under high copper stress (500μM CuCl<sub>2</sub>). Expression levels of the complement strain were similar to that of the knockout. Interestingly, as the level of copper stress increased for the <italic>ΔcsoR</italic> strain, no change in <italic>cso</italic> expression was seen at 50 or 500μM CuCl<sub>2</sub> compared to untreated <italic>ΔcsoR</italic>, unlike in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151816.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).

<p>To test the hypothesis that the <italic>cso</italic> may be under the control of multiple copper sensitive regulators and may not be responding to copper stress in <italic>ΔcsoR</italic> due to increased copper export, we sought to investigate the levels of copper present within each strain. Direct measures of copper such as neutron activation analysis are not reliably precise enough to detect small differences in copper ions within <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref021">21</xref>]. Therefore <italic>mmcO</italic>, part of the copper responsive RicR regulon, was picked as an indirect indicator of copper stress experienced by the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref018">18</xref>]. Thus, samples of wild type, Δ<italic>csoR</italic>, and complement strains under different levels of copper stress were examined by qRT-PCR analysis for <italic>mmcO</italic>. No significant difference in <italic>mmcO</italic> induction was detected between strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151816.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). As with the global transcriptome analysis, <italic>mmcO</italic> was slightly down-regulated in <italic>ΔcsoR</italic> as compared to wild type in copper-free media. This could be indicative of reduced levels of copper present in the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> cytoplasm in <italic>ΔcsoR</italic> in the absence of copper stress. However, once copper was added, <italic>mmcO</italic>, unlike the <italic>cso</italic>, increased drastically in the mutant strain. A similar profile was also observed when copper responsive gene <italic>mymT</italic> was analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0151816.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). These results indicated that under copper stress, copper levels between the three strains were equivalent, excluding the possibility that differences in intracellular copper were contributing to the differential expression of the <italic>cso</italic>. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that other regulators, responsive to copper or related stress, participate in the regulation of the <italic>cso</italic>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Recently, great interest has been taken in the importance of copper homeostasis and its role in bacterial pathogenesis and host defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref028">28</xref>]. Previously, our group elucidated the regulatory mechanisms behind the copper responsive transcriptional repressor CsoR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref013">13</xref>]. We have also shown the shuttling activity of one of its directly regulated genes, <italic>ctpV</italic>, in response to copper stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref015">15</xref>]. In this study, we examined the importance of this negative regulator, CsoR, to both copper and host-mediated stress in a murine model of tuberculosis. While a multifaceted role of CsoR had been previously suggested—in which CsoR has a buffering effect preventing damage from free copper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref013">13</xref>]—our results suggest that the genes within the CsoR regulon, rather than CsoR itself, are primarily responsible for directly mitigating the harmful effects of copper stress. Consistent with this hypothesis, the survival curves of Δ<italic>csoR</italic> at 500μm CuCl<sub>2</sub> are reminiscent of those seen for <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> Δ<italic>ctpV</italic>::<italic>ctpV</italic>, which overexpresses <italic>ctpV</italic>, a copper exporting member of the <italic>csoR</italic> regulon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref015">15</xref>]. Less expected was the dramatic difference in strain survival depending on the use of a fresh, log stage inoculum or one that had been grown to stationary phase before inoculation in copper containing media. One possible cause of this difference could be a slower response to copper stress in the stationary phase cultures, exaggerating the otherwise slight copper resistant phenotype of Δ<italic>csoR</italic>. On the other hand, it may be that the <italic>cso</italic> has a more important role to play during dormancy than during logarithmic phase growth, particularly after lengthy exposures to copper that may allow copper to build up within the cell.</p>
<p>The role of the <italic>cso</italic> in dormancy is supported by the observed induction of <italic>csoR</italic> throughout the enduring hypoxic response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref029">29</xref>]. An increased, hypoxia-specific copper response may be physiologically important as not only is copper more toxic under hypoxic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref030">30</xref>], but hypoxia stimulates macrophages to increase copper uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref031">31</xref>]. In fact hypoxia and high copper levels have both been found within granulomas of guinea pigs during <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection, emphasizing the need to adapt to combat both stress conditions simultaneously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref032">32</xref>]. At the same time, the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> requirement for copper under hypoxia is decreased as copper-independent cytochrome <italic>bd</italic> oxidase is induced, reducing the need for copper-dependent cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref012">12</xref>]. The relationship of <italic>csoR</italic>, copper stress, and hypoxia-induced dormancy is currently being investigated further.</p>
<p>As the host environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref032">32</xref>], particularly the mycobacterial phagosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref005">5</xref>] is known to harbor high levels of copper during <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection as a potential antimicrobial defense mechanism, we were interested in testing if the increased resistance to copper of the Δ<italic>csoR</italic> strain translated to our murine aerosol infection model. Mouse infections revealed that despite similar CFU counts at week 2, the mutant strain multiplied and survived nearly a log fold above wild type through the early stages of chronic infection at weeks 4 and 8. These results might be attributed to the preparedness of the Δ<italic>csoR</italic> strain to face host stress conditions even before they were detected; as transcriptional analysis indicated, the mutant strain already had genes induced that typically respond specifically to host stressors such as copper (<italic>ctpV</italic>), nitric oxide, and hypoxia (<italic>dosR</italic> regulon). Toxic copper levels and nitric oxide are stressors faced by <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> within the phagosome of macrophages, especially those that have been activated. This activation follows the initiation of the adaptive immune response to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection taking place around weeks 2 to 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref033">33</xref>], after which the Δ<italic>csoR</italic> strain shows improved survival over wild type. Previously published data examining our Δ<italic>cso</italic> strain demonstrated a phenotype opposite of that observed for Δ<italic>csoR</italic> during mouse infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref034">34</xref>]. Unlike our Δ<italic>csoR</italic> strain, where the remaining members of the <italic>cso</italic> are induced, the Δ<italic>cso</italic> strain was attenuated, particularly during the later time points of chronic infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref034">34</xref>]. This earlier study, and our transcriptional study showing the induction of the cso during mouse infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref035">35</xref>], highlight the importance of the whole <italic>cso</italic> operon to the survival of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> during infection.</p>
<p>To better understand the control CsoR has over its own operon, we studied transcriptional expression of the <italic>cso</italic> in wild type, knockout, and complement strains in untreated culture and under two levels of copper (50, and 500μM). As expected, we found that without <italic>csoR</italic>, the <italic>cso</italic> genes were induced in the absence of copper. Notably, this induction is not to the same level as the induction seen in wild type under high levels of copper stress (500μM). This indicates that at high levels of copper, CsoR derepression may not be solely responsible for <italic>cso</italic> induction. This hypothesis is consistent with the idea that genes outside of the core copper responsive regulon (n = 15 induced at 50μM CuCl<sub>2</sub>) are induced to address secondary stress such as the presence of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species at higher copper levels (n = 30 induced at 500μM CuCl<sub>2</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref006">6</xref>]. It could be that a second transcriptional regulator is required to further induce the <italic>cso</italic> in response to this toxic level of copper stress. Therefore, disruption of sequence near the binding site of a second regulator may have contributed to a lesser level of <italic>cso</italic> induction. One such candidate may be transcriptional regulator Rv2324 predicted to bind within <italic>csoR</italic> just upstream of the deletion site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref026">26</xref>]. Therefore, the attenuated <italic>cso</italic> induction under high levels of copper stress may have attributed to a more modest survival phenotype of the Δ<italic>csoR</italic> strain under copper and host stress than might otherwise be expected.</p>
<p>Despite the apparent advantage of losing <italic>csoR</italic> under both copper and host stress, our global transcriptional analysis reveals the important role <italic>csoR</italic> plays in the cell under normal growth conditions. While this work has not ventured to define the direct targets of CsoR regulation, our results support previous findings that CsoR may only regulate its own operon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref021">21</xref>]. Both studies found the other members of the <italic>cso</italic> to be induced in the <italic>csoR</italic> mutants to similar levels. The previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref021">21</xref>], however, found no differentially expressed genes outside of the <italic>cso</italic>, in stark contrast to our list of 223 differentially regulated genes. It is possible, as the authors point out, that the previously studied strain is a polar knockout, unlike ours. It may be that translation of the <italic>cso</italic> in their Δ<italic>csoR</italic>:: <italic>hyg</italic><sub><italic>R</italic></sub> strain was not as efficient as in the Δ<italic>csoR</italic> strain discussed here, therefore mitigating any stress we posit is placed on the cell when the operon is deregulated in the absence of <italic>csoR</italic>. We hypothesize that this stress is derived from the consequences of <italic>cso</italic> overexpression in the absence of copper. Interestingly, outside of the <italic>cso</italic>, the only copper responsive genes to be differentially expressed were down regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref006">6</xref>]. It may be that lower levels of copper in the Δ<italic>csoR</italic> strain, due to increased Cu export by CtpV, tightened copper mediated repression of these genes such as <italic>mmcO</italic> and <italic>mymT</italic>, by regulators such as RicR. This tightening of repression was observed in our RNA-Seq and confirmed by qRT-PCR above. This compensatory response suggests a hierarchy of copper regulation in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> with CsoR having a key role. It should also be noted, however, that these previous studies were conducted using microarray analysis, which can be less sensitive to differential expression than RNA-Seq analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref036">36</xref>]. Therefore, the absence of more extensive overlap among these studies may be partially due to the difference in technique used.</p>
<p>A major consequence of the loss of <italic>csoR</italic> and the deregulation of the <italic>cso</italic> was the induction of the DosR regulon. While culture manipulation can cause a slight but significant induction of the DosR regulon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref037">37</xref>], great care was taken to quickly process all samples to be used for RNA analysis in an identical fashion. The observed induction of the DosR regulon was substantial, and likely too high to be caused by handling differences. While the mechanism for this induction remains unresolved, we have modeled two opposing hypotheses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151816.g006">Fig 6</xref>). The first is based on data suggesting that disruption in the electron transport system or cytochrome c oxidase induces expression of the DosR regulon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref038">38</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151816.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). As cytochrome c oxidase, involved in the terminal steps of cellular respiration, is a copper metalloenzyme, <italic>cso</italic> induction resulting in excessive copper export could negatively impact its function. This block in respiration may contribute to the activation of the DosR regulon.</p>

<title>Potential consequences of Δ<italic>csoR</italic> disrupted copper homeostasis.</title>
<p>Overexpression of the <italic>cso</italic> and the proteins it codes for after deletion of <italic>csoR</italic> (dark red) may result in excessive levels of copper export by CtpV (red). <bold>(A)</bold> As a result, pools of copper (orange) for metalloenzyme usage may be depleted, reducing the levels of functional proteins such as cytochrome c oxidase (yellow), as seen in the panel on the right. This could potentially slow the electron transport chain leading to the induction of the DosR (blue) regulon through the redox sensor, DosS (blue) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref038">38</xref>]. The wild type strain is shown in the panel on the left for comparison. <bold>(B)</bold> Alternatively, the increased cytoplasmic export of copper may lead to a buildup of copper in the mycobacterial periplasmic space where MmcO (green) usually assists in copper detoxification. The increased copper stress in this region may be magnified, however, by the down regulation of <italic>mmcO</italic> in the mutant strain. Free copper can lead to the production of reactive nitrogen species, such as NO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref039">39</xref>]. NO can trigger expression of the DosR regulon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref025">25</xref>]. The wild type strain is shown in the panel on the left for comparison.

</fig>
<p>A second possibility could be that NO is directly inducing the DosR regulon in our Δ<italic>csoR</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151816.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). While we hypothesize that copper may be present at lower levels in the cytoplasmic space, CtpV is thought to export copper across only the cell membrane. We do not know if expression levels of genes involved in the export of copper across the mycobacterial cell wall were affected, as the only gene proposed to fulfill this role in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>, Rv1698, was later excluded as a potential candidate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref040">40</xref>]. Thus it is possible that copper could be accumulating and causing damage in the mycobacterial periplasmic space of Δ<italic>csoR</italic>. This damage could be exacerbated by the slight down-regulation of a recently characterized periplasmic multicopper oxidase, <italic>mmcO</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref023">23</xref>]. Cu(I) can generate NO through interactions with S-nitrosothiols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref039">39</xref>], which could subsequently induce the DosR regulon.</p>
<p>These scenarios and the stressed transcriptional profile of the Δ<italic>csoR</italic> strain highlight the potential harm that can be done even at low levels of copper and emphasize the need for balance in regulating the level of intracellular copper, as aided by <italic>csoR</italic>. This increased understanding of the balance of copper <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> must maintain during infection may ultimately help guide development of antimycobacterial therapies that wish to utilize copper or target the copper stress response. Overall this study has revealed new insights into the importance of copper regulation and <italic>csoR</italic>, not only under copper stress, but also in its absence. Similar copper regulators are present in other intracellular pathogens and similar scenarios could be at play in these organisms as well.</p>

To determine the polar or nonpolar nature of the construct, RNA was isolated from the strain using a TRIzol® Reagent based method before treatment with TURBO™ DNase (Ambion®, Austin, TX) until PCR negative. RNA was then reverse transcribed to cDNA using Superscript® III (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). cDNA was then screened by PCR for the expression of the genes downstream of <italic>csoR</italic>: Rv0968, <italic>ctpV</italic>, and Rv0970. Our analysis indicated that the mutant was polar.</p>
<p>To construct an unmarked mutant strain, a helper plasmid, pYUB870, was used to remove the <italic>hyg</italic><sub><italic>R</italic></sub> gene as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref014">14</xref>], leaving behind a stop codon at the 14<sup>th</sup> amino acid of the <italic>csoR</italic> gene. Again these results were confirmed by sequencing and the nonpolar nature of this mutant was demonstrated as described above. This strain was used for the construction of a complement strain. The <italic>csoR</italic> gene and the 200bp promoter region upstream of the <italic>csoR</italic> transcriptional start site were cloned into the integrative, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>-mycobacterial shuttle vector pMV306, originally derived from pMV361 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151816.ref041">41</xref>].

The samples were run on an Illumina MiSeq™ to generating 300bp paired end reads. Base calling was done in CASAVA 1.8.2. Reads were mapped to the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv genome (NC_000962.3) using the CLC Genomics Workbench 8.0.1 (CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark). SNPs were detected using the Fixed Ploidy Variant Detection tool, and larger genomic variations were detected using the InDels and Structural Variants tool with the same software.</p>
