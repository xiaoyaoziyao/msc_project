      <abstract>
        <p>Recent advances in fluorescence microscopy have extended the spatial resolution to the nanometer scale. Here, we report an engineered photoconvertible fluorescent protein (pcFP) variant, designated as mMaple, that is suited for use in multiple conventional and super-resolution imaging modalities, specifically, widefield and confocal microscopy, structured illumination microscopy (SIM), and single-molecule localization microscopy. We demonstrate the versatility of mMaple by obtaining super-resolution images of protein organization in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and conventional fluorescence images of mammalian cells. Beneficial features of mMaple include high photostability of the green state when expressed in mammalian cells and high steady state intracellular protein concentration of functional protein when expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>. mMaple thus enables both fast live-cell ensemble imaging and high precision single molecule localization for a single pcFP-containing construct.</p>

      <p>A new generation of fluorescence microscopes is capable of imaging with nanometer-scale resolution.

The highest resolutions have been obtained in fixed samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Rust1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Shtengel1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Bates1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Huang2">[11]</xref> but technical improvements now allow living samples to be characterized with effective frame rates on the second(s) timescale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Shroff1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Jones1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>By comparison, SIM and stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED) provide relatively high-speed image acquisition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Kner1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Lefman1">[15]</xref> and also achieve sub-diffraction limit image resolution. The spatial resolution of linear SIM is twice that of a conventional microscope (i.e., ∼125 nm laterally and ∼250 nm axially for visible light) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Gustafsson1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Gustafsson2">[17]</xref>, while STED obtains diffraction-unlimited resolution, achieving 40–70 nm resolution in three dimensions for biological samples labeled with fluorescent dyes and proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Willig1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Hein1">[21]</xref>. Characterization of live-cell protein dynamics is more tractable with these techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Gustafsson1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Gustafsson2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Schmidt1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Donnert1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Donnert2">[23]</xref>; however, the highest resolutions are typically obtained with fixed samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Betzig1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Hess1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Shtengel1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Since each super-resolution implementation has its own advantages and limitations, it would be advantageous to apply multiple imaging modalities to one sample. This would allow investigators to watch dynamic complexes assemble and move, while also allowing them to characterize the detailed organization of these complexes, without the need for distinct probes and labeling strategies. Different super-resolution imaging approaches would appear to require fluorescent probes with seemingly incompatible properties. (f-)PALM/STORM requires probes that can be switched with high contrast between two spectrally distinct states, including photoactivatable FPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Patterson1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Subach1">[25]</xref>, photoswitchable FPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Ando1">[26]</xref>, photoconvertible (pc) FPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Ando2">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Hoi1">[31]</xref> and organic dyes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Rust1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Bates1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Heilemann1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Dempsey1">[34]</xref>. By contrast, SIM and STED are compatible with many conventional fluorophores (e.g., enhanced green FP (EGFP)) and for these methods, high fluorophore brightness and photostability are necessary for achieving the highest resolutions.</p>
      <p>Here we report a new green-to-red pcFP variant, known as mMaple, derived from the previously reported pcFP mClavGR2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Hoi1">[31]</xref>. Using the <italic>E. coli</italic> chemotaxis network as a model system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Greenfield1">[9]</xref>, we demonstrate that mMaple protein fusions are functional and provide brighter green state fluorescence intensity in cells than either EGFP or the widely used pcFP, mEos2. Furthermore, we show that the combination of green-to-red photoconversion and high green state brightness allow mMaple to be used for both (f-)PALM/STORM and SIM. Single pcFP counting in individual bacterial cells by (f-)PALM/STORM reveals that a key contributor to the favorable properties of mMaple is a high intracellular concentration of properly folded (and therefore photoconvertible) mMaple fusion proteins. Due to its improved folding efficiency and photostability, mMaple has significant advantages over other proteins currently used for super-resolution microscopy.</p>

        <p>Though mClavGR2 pcFP is monomeric at high concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Hoi1">[31]</xref>, we were concerned that it might have a weak tendency to dimerize, since residues 220–224 (HSGLP) are identical to the ones that form part of the dimer interface in related <italic>Anthozoa</italic> FPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Henderson1">[35]</xref>. Thus, we replaced residues 220–224 with the corresponding residues (RNSTD) from the close homologue mTFP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Ai1">[36]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051314.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Starting from this modified mClavGR2 variant, we undertook 4 rounds of protein optimization by creating successive libraries of ∼5 thousand genetic variants and screening these libraries for efficient photoconversion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Hoi1">[31]</xref>. <italic>E. coli</italic> colonies with high brightness and an improved ratio of red fluorescence (after photoconversion) to green fluorescence (before photoconversion) were considered “winners” of a given round of screening. In the final round of optimization, the winners of all previous rounds were genetically shuffled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Zhao1">[37]</xref>. Screening of this final library led to the discovery of mMaple, a variant that retains many of the key traits of mClavGR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051314-g001"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref><bold>; </bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0051314-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>), yet provides an improved ratio of red-to-green photoconversion. mMaple is equivalent to mClavGR2 with the HSGLP to RNSTD replacement and A145V/G171S/G225S.</p>

        <p><italic>In vitro</italic> characterization revealed that the primary difference between mMaple and the earlier mClavGR2 variant is a shift in the ground state equilibrium of the green state chromophore from the phenolate form (absorbance λ<sub>max</sub> = 489 nm) towards the phenol form (absorbance λ<sub>max</sub> = 380 nm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051314-g002"><bold>Fig. 2A</bold></xref>). This shift is attributed to an increase in the apparent p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> of the green state chromophore from 8.0 to 8.2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0051314-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref><bold>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051314.s002">Fig. S2</xref></bold>). The increased ratio of phenol to phenolate form in the green state explains the improved photoconversion contrast of mMaple (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051314-g002"><bold>Fig. 2</bold></xref>), since it is the phenol form that undergoes the green-to-red photoconversion and it is the phenolate form that is green fluorescent. The post-conversion red state retains the same p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> as mClavGR2 (7.3), so the population of the red fluorescent phenolate form remains unchanged (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0051314-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). We speculate that the A145V mutation is primarily responsible for the shift of the green state p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub>, since position 145 is located immediately adjacent to the tyrosine-derived phenolate moiety of the chromophore. Although it does not directly interact with the chromophore, the bulkier side chain of valine may stabilize the protonated state by decreasing the solvent accessibility of the chromophore. Notably, position 145 is occupied by proline in all other pcFPs except Kaede <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Ando2">[27]</xref>, which has alanine at this position. The effect of the additional mutations (G171S, G225S) is unclear, as they are relatively remote from the chromophore.</p>

        <title><italic>In vivo</italic> Performance of mMaple in (f-)PALM/STORM Imaging</title>
        <p>The basis of (f-)PALM/STORM imaging is the conversion of a fluorophore between two spectrally distinct states. We hoped that mMaple’s more highly populated photoconvertible green state would increase the number of observed proteins in (f-)PALM/STORM images, when compared to other pcFPs. We used the well-characterized <italic>E. coli</italic> chemotaxis network as a model system, due to its controllable expression levels and a sensitive functionality assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Greenfield1">[9]</xref>. We prepared plasmids encoding fusions to the <italic>E. coli</italic> chemotaxis protein CheW under control of an L-arabinose inducible promoter. When expressed in a <italic>cheW</italic> knockout strain, each pcFP-CheW fusion recovers the strain’s chemotaxis ability to approximately 65% that of wildtype swarming (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051314.s003">Fig. S3A</xref>–B</bold>).</p>
        <p>To quantify the number of proteins observed for each construct, we imaged fixed Δ<italic>cheW E. coli</italic> expressing CheW fusions to mMaple, mClavGR2, or mEos2 at optimal induction levels using a custom built (f-)PALM/STORM microscope <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Bates2">[38]</xref>. In all 3 cases, (f-)PALM/STORM images revealed that the subcellular CheW distribution could be constructed from localizing hundreds of single proteins per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051314-g003"><bold>Fig. 3A–C</bold></xref>). After photoconversion, the mean number of photons detected in the red state for each construct were similar, allowing for similar localization precision for all constructs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Thompson1">[39]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051314-g003"><bold>Fig. 3D</bold></xref><bold>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051314.s004">Fig. S4</xref></bold>). The largest difference among the pcFPs was that mMaple constructs reliably yielded more protein localizations than mEos2 or mClavGR2 per cell (3.4× and 2.3×, respectively) under identical growth and imaging conditions. At native expression levels, each cell should contain approximately 6000 CheW proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Li1">[40]</xref>. However, since the depth of field of the objective restricts the observable region to the lower ∼40% of the cell, approximately 2400 CheW proteins should be imaged. On average, per-cell, we observed 927±547 mMaple-CheW localizations (<italic>N</italic> = 45 cells), 396±181 mClavGR2-CheW localizations (<italic>N</italic> = 48 cells), and 269±113 mEos2-CheW localizations (<italic>N</italic> = 38 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051314-g003"><bold>Fig. 3E</bold></xref>). The number of observable mMaple-CheW localizations is closer to the expected native levels of CheW expression than either mClavGR2 or mEos2. To ensure that the higher number of localizations is not fusion specific, we imaged each pcFP inside fixed wildtype <italic>E. coli</italic> with no binding partner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051314-g004"><bold>Fig. 4A–B</bold></xref><bold>; left panels</bold>). In this case, we obtain approximately 10× the number of localizations per cell for mMaple expressing cells (3497±1641 localizations) relative to mEos2 expressing cells (209±86 localizations).</p>

Individual protein localizations are shown in grey whereas closely spaced localizations (&lt;30 nm) are grouped into clusters of the same color (right panels). The bright field and conventional fluorescence images are shown for comparison (left panels, left and right inset respectively). Scale bars are 500 nm.

(<bold>D</bold>) The distribution of cluster sizes (&lt;30 nm interlocalization spacing) for cytoplasmically expressed pcFPs. (<bold>E</bold>) Average number of cytoplasmically expressed proteins per cell. Rather than counting each localization as a single molecule, we count each cluster of localizations (localizations spaced &lt;30 nm) as a single protein. The dotted lines in (A–B) denote the <italic>E. coli</italic> cell boundary. Scale bars are 500 nm and 50 nm (zooms). Zooms in (A–B) show possible reversible photoswitching events of single proteins. Error is the standard deviation (N = 20 cells (mMaple), N = 17 cells (mClavGR2), N = 16 cells (mEos2)). The large error bars are primarily due to variation in protein expression between cells.</p>

        <p>It is important to note that measuring absolute numbers of proteins with (f-)PALM/STORM imaging is highly challenging. Factors such as non-fluorescent misfolded proteins, as well as on-off fluorescence switching events, in which fewer than 150 photons are emitted (below the reconstruction algorithm’s detection threshold), result in a fraction of fluorophores which are not counted, thus affecting the total number of localizations observed. Additionally, due to the relatively high p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> of mMaple, at any one time a fraction of the photoconverted proteins will be in the protonated state and thus not observable in the red fluorescent channel. We expect that the interconversion of the protonated and non-protonated states is fast relative to our exposure times. This will cause each single fluorescent protein to spend part of the time in the red fluorescent state during each exposure. However, it is possible that these factors may lead to underestimations of the true numbers of fluorescent proteins in a sample.</p>

        <title>Origins of mMaple’s Superior Performance in both (f-) PALM/STORM and SIM</title>
        <p>The experiments discussed above demonstrate that mMaple is a useful “multimodal” FP, but questions remained as to why mMaple protein fusions yielded higher numbers of localizations than other FPs in (f-)PALM/STORM images.</p>
        <p>One possible explanation would be that mMaple has a higher propensity for reversible photoswitching, which would increase the number of observed localizations per cell. For instance, the red fluorescent state of mEos2 can undergo multiple cycles of reversible photoswitching into a long-lived dark state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Annibale1">[41]</xref>. This effect is important to consider for accurate protein counting measurements using (f-)PALM/STORM images <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Greenfield1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Annibale1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Annibale2">[42]</xref>. Indeed, we found that mMaple and mClavGR2 also exhibit reversible photoswitching of the red state (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051314.s007">Fig. S7</xref></bold>). To quantify the extent of reversible photoswitching, we used a previously described clustering algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Greenfield1">[9]</xref> to group closely spaced protein localizations (&lt;30 nm interlocalization spacing, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051314-g004"><bold>Fig. 4A–B</bold></xref>; right panels), and classified these groups as resulting from reversible switching of a single protein. Analysis of the (f-)PALM/STORM images of <italic>E. coli</italic> with cytoplasmically expressed pcFPs revealed that 56% of mMaple, and over 80% of both mClavGR2 and mEos2 localizations did not have a second localization within 30 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051314-g004"><bold>Fig. 4D</bold></xref><bold>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051314.s008">Fig. S8</xref></bold>). To further quantify possible reversible switching events, we imaged single mMaple and mEos2 proteins immobilized on a glass coverslip using (f-)PALM/STORM (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051314.s009">Fig. S9A</xref>–B</bold>). During image analysis, we once again grouped closely spaced localizations into clusters and obtained cluster size distributions for mMaple, mEos2, and the negative control for which no fluorescent proteins were present (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051314.s009">Fig. S9C</xref></bold>). The background subtracted cluster size distributions for each pcFP revealed that approximately 35% of mMaple localizations and 65% of mEos2 localizations were observed as single localizations (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051314.s009">Fig. S9D</xref></bold>). Therefore we conclude that, under our imaging conditions, the red fluorescent state of mMaple has a two-fold higher propensity to reversibly photoswitch than mEos2.</p>
        <p>Does this two-fold increased reversible photoswitching completely account for the differences in the number of localizations observed in <italic>E. coli</italic> containing different cytoplasmically expressed pcFPs? We reassessed the (f-)PALM/STORM images of cytoplasmic pcFPs by counting both isolated localizations and clusters of localizations (&lt;30 nm interlocalization spacing) as single proteins. Using this counting procedure we obtained an average number of proteins per cell for mMaple (765±283) that is approximately 7× higher than for mEos2 (109±55) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051314-g004"><bold>Fig. 4E</bold></xref>), suggesting that the higher number of fluorophore localizations seen for mMaple constructs in <italic>E. coli</italic> is not simply due to reversible photoswitching.</p>
        <p>We next investigated whether differences in photoconversion probability could explain the increased number of localizations observed for mMaple in (f-)PALM/STORM. The two factors that contribute to the photoconversion probability are the extinction coefficient at 405 nm and the quantum yield for photoconversion. The extinction coefficient of mMaple at 405 nm is 10,300 M<sup>−1</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup>, whereas mEos2 is 4,400 M<sup>−1</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup>. However, this 2.3× higher absorbance for mMaple is counterbalanced by a 5.5× lower quantum yield of photoconversion. Taking both factors into account, mEos2 has a 2.4× higher probability of photoconverting under identical illumination conditions. Accordingly, we conclude that the increased number of localizations obtained with mMaple is not due to differences in photoconversion probability.</p>
        <p>A final possible contributor to the increased number of mMaple-CheW localizations observed in (f-)PALM/STORM images is a difference in pcFP folding/maturation efficiency in <italic>E. coli</italic>. We investigated this possibility <italic>in vitro</italic>, such that quantitative comparisons could be made. SDS-PAGE of the soluble and insoluble lysate fractions for <italic>E. coli</italic> expressing each pcFP revealed a substantial improvement in folding efficiency of mMaple (100% of mMaple was found in the soluble fraction compared to 29% for mEos2) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051314.s010">Fig. S10</xref></bold>). An increased concentration of properly folded mMaple-CheW <italic>in vivo</italic> most likely accounts for both the increased number of localizations and the relatively low induction levels needed to provide strong green-state fluorescence signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051314-g005"><bold>Fig. 5A</bold></xref>). Does the increased folding efficiency of mMaple fully explain its performance in SIM imaging? Obtaining 3D-SIM reconstructions typically requires a large number of images of a sample, therefore it is important to use bright and photostable fluorophores to increase image quality. The high <italic>in vivo</italic> concentration of mMaple provides a partial explanation for the experimentally observed <italic>in vivo</italic> green-state brightness, but it does not explain the apparent lack of appreciable fading during prolonged SIM image acquisition. Quantifying resistance to photobleaching in living cells under widefield illumination, revealed that mMaple’s green state was 14-fold more photostable than mEos2’s green state, as judged by time to 50% loss of signal (65.1 sec for mMaple and 4.6 sec for mEos2) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051314.s005">Fig. S5</xref></bold>). Therefore, we attribute the high quality of the <italic>E. coli</italic> SIM images to mMaple’s higher <italic>in vivo</italic> green state photostability. The advantages and limitations of mMaple relative to mEos2, for these specific applications and uses, are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0051314-t002">Table 2</xref>.</p>

        <title>mMaple’s Performance in Mammalian Cells</title>
        <p>To determine mMaple’s performance in mammalian cells, we performed fluorescence imaging and flow cytometry analysis of HeLa cells transfected with plasmids encoding pcFP-actin and pcFP-actinin fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051314-g007"><bold>Fig. 7</bold></xref>). Visual examination of transfected cells revealed similar overall brightness and localization patterns for mMaple and mEos2. However, when the brightness of a large population of cells was assessed by flow cytometry, it was apparent that mMaple-actin or mMaple-actinin was not brighter than either of the corresponding mEos2 or mClavGR2 fusions when expressed in mammalian cells. For the actinin fusion, mClavGR2 had the greatest fraction of bright cells, followed by mMaple and mEos2. For the actin fusion, mClavGR2 and mEos2 had similar distributions that were shifted towards higher brightness relative to mMaple. Further examination of the actin constructs showed that though the overall brightness of the mMaple-actin constructs was not increased relative to the other pcFPs. Although these results were disappointing, we noted that the photostability of mMaple-actin is improved by almost three-fold (10.0 sec for mMaple in comparison to 3.6 sec as judged by confocal imaging), increasing the utility of the mMaple-actin construct in applications requiring green-state photostability (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051314.s011">Fig. S11</xref></bold>). Due to the large cell-to-cell heterogeneity in expression levels following transient transfection of mammalian cells, we did not attempt to compare numbers of localizations by PALM imaging. These results indicate that the exceptional folding efficiency of mMaple for prokaryotic imaging does not simply translate to mammalian cells. Perhaps, this limitation reflects the extensive directed evolution in bacterial cells used to generate mMaple. The brightness of mMaple and other pcFPs in mammalian cells is clearly fusion- and context specific and likely depends on a number of as-yet poorly understood factors. However, it is clear that the photostability of mMaple’s green state is much improved relative to mEos2 in both <italic>E. coli</italic> and mammalian cells.</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>We have engineered a photoconvertible protein with a fortuitous combination of properties that enables this FP to be used in both (f-)PALM/STORM and SIM. The major advantages of mMaple over mEos2 are more efficient protein folding and a significantly increased photostability of the green state. We expect that this new variant will be of utility as it allows the dynamics of protein complexes to be characterized <italic>in vivo</italic> with increased spatial resolution and good temporal resolution (e.g., by SIM or conventional imaging), and also allows the precise localization of the same fusion proteins to be determined with (f-)PALM/STORM. It remains to be determined if these advantages will translate to other types of prokaryotic cells, and/or different mammalian cell fusions. We hope that the advent of mMaple will spur efforts to engineer a new generation of FPs that exploit the advantages of various imaging modalities.</p>

As with all gene libraries for screening and single genes for large scale expression, purification, and <italic>in vitro</italic> characterization, the full length gene was digested by Xho1 and EcoR1 and ligated with T4 ligase (Invitrogen) into similarly digested pBAD/His B vector. To create a gene library with all possible residues at position 173, the template gene was subjected to two separate PCR amplifications: one with forward primer4 and reverse primer3 and one with forward primer2 and reverse primer5. The PCR products were combined and the full length gene assembled by overlap extension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Ho1">[43]</xref>. Creation of randomly mutated and gene shuffled libraries was carried out as previous described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Hoi1">[31]</xref>. Following ligation, electrocompetent <italic>E. coli</italic> strain DH10B (Invitrogen) was transformed and plated on LB/agar plates supplemented with ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml) and L-arabinose (0.02%). For library screening, plates were incubated for 14 h at 37°C prior to inspection.</p>
        <p>The screening setup and general protocol was been previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051314-Hoi1">[31]</xref>. Briefly, Petri dishes harboring colonies of <italic>E. coli</italic> transformed with a gene library were imaged to record their initial green fluorescence intensity. The plate was then subjected to illumination from a dense array of 405 nm LEDs. The red fluorescence intensity of the same dish was recorded after photoconversion. Digital fluorescence images were then processed to acquire both the green and red fluorescence intensity of each colony. In an effort to more effectively identify variants that exhibited rapid photoconversion, the illumination (i.e., photoconversion) time of the colony libraries was decreased from 20 min to 10 min. Colonies that exhibit both high brightness and an improved ratio of red fluorescence after photoconversion to green fluorescence before photoconversion are considered “winners” of a given round of screening and served as templates for the following round of library generation.</p>

        <p>Single biotinylated pcFPs were immobilized on an glass coverslip by incubating the slide with 1.0 mg/mL biotinylated bovine serum albumin (b-BSA, Sigma) solution for 30 sec, followed by 0.25 mg/mL streptavidin (Invitrogen) and then biotinylated pcFPs at approximately 0.6 µM in PBS, which were sonicated prior to addition. To correct for drift, 200 nm yellow-green beads (Molecular Probes) diluted in PBS were added to the chamber and immobilized using a buffer containing 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl and 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The slide was rinsed with PBS prior to the addition of each reagent.</p>
        <p>Single pcFPs were imaged in PBS using continuous activation and excitation using 405 nm and 561 lasers for 10,000 frames at constant laser power. To determine the degree of false positive events observed during imaging, a sample chamber containing only PBS and fiduciary markers was imaged. (f-)PALM/STORM images were reconstructed and drift corrected as described above.</p>
        <p>To determine the degree of reversible photoswitching, closely spaced molecules were grouped, resulting in a cluster size distribution for each pcFP as well as the negative control. The distribution obtained from the negative control was subtracted from the resulting pcFP distributions to remove the population of false positives resulting from events unrelated to pcFP fluorescence.</p>

This peak is diminished in size for mMaple relative to mClavGR2 (6.7% vs. 25.8% of monomer peak area). While this peak does elute at a time consistent with the dimer species, it was not observed following reinjection of the collected and concentrated monomeric peak of either mClavGR2 (injection concentration of 0.34 mM) or mMaple (injection concentration of 0.39 mM). The fact that the species eluting at 63 min was not observed in the reinjection suggests that it is not the typical non-covalent dimer species expected for weakly dimerizing fluorescent proteins. While the nature of this species remains unclear, it is apparent that the tendency of it to form is reduced in mMaple.</p>

As the protein is exposed to 532 nm light, the protein is switched from the red state to the dark state (green regions), which can be re-excited by 460 nm light (blue region), 405 nm light (violet region) and white light (light grey region).
