<abstract>
<p>Dental caries is caused by the release of organic acids from fermentative bacteria, which results in the dissolution of hydroxyapatite matrices of enamel and dentine. While low environmental pH is proposed to cause a shift in the consortium of oral bacteria, favouring the development of caries, the impact of this variable has been overlooked in microbial population studies. This study aimed to detail the zonal composition of the microbiota associated with carious dentine lesions with reference to pH. We used 454 sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene (V3–V4 region) to compare microbial communities in layers ranging in pH from 4.5–7.8 from 25 teeth with advanced dentine caries. Pyrosequencing of the amplicons yielded 449,762 sequences. Nine phyla, 97 genera and 409 species were identified from the quality-filtered, de-noised and chimera-free sequences. Among the microbiota associated with dentinal caries, the most abundant taxa included <italic>Lactobacillus sp.</italic>, <italic>Prevotella sp.</italic>, <italic>Atopobium sp.</italic>, <italic>Olsenella sp.</italic> and <italic>Actinomyces sp.</italic> We found a disparity between microbial communities localised at acidic versus neutral pH strata. Acidic conditions were associated with low diversity microbial populations, with <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species including <italic>L. fermentum</italic>, <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> and <italic>L. crispatus</italic>, being prominent. In comparison, the distinctive species of a more diverse flora associated with neutral pH regions of carious lesions included <italic>Alloprevotella tanerrae</italic>, <italic>Leptothrix</italic> sp., <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> sp. and <italic>Streptococcus anginosus</italic>. While certain bacteria were affected by the pH gradient, we also found that ∼60% of the taxa associated with caries were present across the investigated pH range, representing a substantial core. We demonstrated that some bacterial species implicated in caries progression show selective clustering with respect to pH gradient, providing a basis for specific therapeutic strategies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dental caries is the most prevalent chronic disease of mankind <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-WHO1">[1]</xref>. In regard to cost and quality of life, oral diseases including caries, pose a major burden in developed countries and an increasing problem in developing countries. Advances have not yet had a global impact on caries prevention, with current epidemiological studies indicating a marked increase in prevalence of dental decay among all age groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Petersen1">[2]</xref>. The rise in prevalence of caries is despite the proven efficacy of fluoride use and application in control of this disease. Children, immigrants and low socio-economic groups are those mainly affected by this trend <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Bagramian1">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>Dental caries is caused by acids produced by commensal microbes within oral biofilms known as plaque <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Marsh1">[4]</xref>. Organic acids, including acetic, lactic and propionic, produced as the by-products of fermentation, dissolve the hydroxyapatite component of enamel and dentine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Hojo1">[5]</xref> leading to tooth surface breakdown and subsequent cavity formation. In the cavitated lesion, exposed dentine collagen fibres are also subject to enzymatic degradation by bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Kawasaki1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>In most classical medical infections, a single pathogen is responsible for the disease and this pathogen may be present in an otherwise sterile site or a site that is not naturally host to the isolated species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Marsh2">[7]</xref>. In comparison, caries is a polymicrobial infection mediated by commensal oral microbes. The oral environment is home to diverse bacterial populations, with the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD) documenting the presence of approximately 600 prokaryote species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Dewhirst1">[8]</xref>. Considering this large diversity of microbiota in the oral ecosystem, our understanding of the microbial aetiology of caries and how environmental conditions in the oral cavity impact the disease process continues to change as technology advances.</p>
<p>Traditional culture and culture-independent techniques have provided low-level resolution information regarding the microbiota associated with caries. Culture studies showed that <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> is the chief pathogen associated with caries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Loesche1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Loesche2">[10]</xref>, in addition to <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. and <italic>Actinomyces</italic> spp. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Loesche1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-vanHoute1">[11]</xref>. The identification of a small number of bacteria associated with caries led to the proposed ‘specific plaque hypothesis’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Loesche2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Hamada1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Loesche3">[13]</xref>. This resulted in chemical and immunological therapeutic approaches being directed against specific microbial targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Talbman1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Beighton1">[17]</xref>. However, caries has been found to occur in the absence of <italic>S. mutans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Beighton1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Gross1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>The lack of involvement of <italic>S. mutans</italic> in some lesions led to the proposal for the ‘mixed/non- specific microbial hypothesis’, formulated to include other acid producing bacteria in caries initiation and progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-vanHoute1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Kleinberg1">[21]</xref>. Culture-independent studies provided support for this hypothesis, revealing a greater diversity of bacteria associated with caries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Aas1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Becker1">[24]</xref>. Clonal analysis of the 16S rRNA gene revealed that a diverse array of bacteria including <italic>S. mutans</italic>, non-mutans streptococci and members of the genera <italic>Actinomyces</italic>, <italic>Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Propionibacterium</italic>, <italic>Veillonella, Selenomonas and Atopobium</italic> are associated with different stages of carious lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Gross1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Aas1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Gross2">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>Neither the specific or non-specific microbial hypotheses highlight the impact of ecological variables on microbiota associated with caries. To address this, the ‘ecological plaque hypothesis’ was proposed, which suggested the biofilm be considered as a bacterial community and caries as a ‘dysbiosis’ caused by the changing makeup of the oral microbiota in response to changing environmental variables <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Marsh1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Marsh2">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Takahashi1">[26]</xref>. Fundamental variables suggested to influence the genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of the oral microbiota include: nutrient availability, oxygen concentration and pH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Marsh1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Marsh2">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Takahashi1">[26]</xref>. While the former two factors cannot be assessed accurately in a complex polymicrobial community, pH of a carious lesion can be measured with relative accuracy. Low environmental pH was proposed to cause a shift to an acid-tolerant and acid-producing consortium of bacteria, which alters the balance from remineralisation to demineralization, hence favouring the formation of lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Takahashi1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>The capacity of many aciduric and acidogenic bacterial species to lower the pH of the environment has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Badet1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Takahashi2">[29]</xref>. However, knowledge of how the oral bacterial community shifts with pH gradient in caries is restricted to chemostat-controlled studies, which are limited to assessing a small number of species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Bradshaw1">[30]</xref>. The advent of next-generation sequencing techniques, such as pyrosequencing, enables in-depth analysis of microbial communities. The recent application of pyrosequencing to determine which microbial taxa are associated with dental caries has focused on documenting variation between caries-active and -free bacterial communities in plaque and saliva <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Yang1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-BeldaFerre1">[33]</xref>. These studies, while documenting the changing community structure between health and caries with in-depth sequencing, do not reveal how key ecological variables, such as pH, influence the oral microbial community structure. Therefore, the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of the ecological plaque hypothesis is yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p>We used 454 sequencing technology to examine the bacterial community associated with dentine caries and to demonstrate how the diversity is influenced by the pH of dentinal cavitated lesions. The pH within a lesion was found to strongly affect the microbial composition of 42% of the dentine caries associated bacteria. This information enabled us to propose a ‘substantial’ core model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Hamady1">[34]</xref> of the bacterial profile of dentine caries with reference to pH gradient.</p>

<title>Ethics statement</title>
<p>The NSW Health Ethics committee approved the study design, sampling method and written consent forms (Protocol Number X07-0261). Verbal and written consents were obtained from all participants in this study.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Sampling</title>
<p>Teeth with occlusal or proximal caries (n = 25) that had open cavities and a diagnosis of irreversible pulpitis were extracted with verbal and written informed consent from adult patients of European, Asian or African descent residing in Sydney, Australia (Female:11 Male:14). Tooth extraction occurred following a discussion of the possible treatment options in regard to the affected tooth. Prior to the extraction, subjects had not taken antibiotics within the previous four weeks and had no carbohydrate intake in the preceding two hours. Dentine samples were taken from the extracted teeth using sterile slow speed handpieces and sterile size one round burs. We took 4 to 5 sequential layers of 1 mm-thick dentine, starting circumferentially from the carious lesion and progressing into sound dentin (last layer). The layers ranged from layer 1, representing the most superficial zone of the lesion, to layer 5, which was the deepest part of the lesion. All sample collection was performed by a single calibrated dentist. We collected a total of 112 samples, the minimum wet weight being 7 mg/sample. Samples were suspended in 0.9% NaCl to a concentration of 1 mg in 4 µl of saline.</p>

<title>pH measurement</title>
<p>We performed pH measurements using a minimum of 30 µl suspension of dentine samples at 1 mg per 4 µl of saline, to give a stable suspension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Hojo2">[35]</xref>. To measure pH, we used a palladium Touch Microelectrode (Beetrode® NMPH3, World Precision Instruments Ltd., UK) with a 100 µm sensor tip. We measured pH of the samples within 15 minutes following suspension preparation. Calibration trials confirmed the stability of hydrogen ion concentration of the suspension over the limited time period of sampling. Three non-carious control teeth were also included in the pH measurement.</p>

<title>Preparation of 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries and 454 sequencing</title>
<p>We used PCR to amplify microbial DNA in the dentine samples using 16S rRNA gene primers and pyrosequencing in order to examine the contents of the amplicon libraries. We targeted the phylogenetically informative V3–V4 hypervariable region of 16S rRNA gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Claesson1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Huse1">[40]</xref>, using previously described primers, 331F/797R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Nadkarni1">[41]</xref>. This region was targeted because it has been found to provide a higher level of bacterial coverage at the phylum and domain level, compared to other regions of the 16S gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Huse1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Klindworth1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Ahn1">[43]</xref>. These primers produced a 466 base pair long amplicon. The forward fusion primer contained sample-specific Multiplex identifier (MID) tags, which were developed by 454 Life Sciences Corp. (TCB No. 005-2009; Branford, CT, USA). We used a total of 56 MIDs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092940.s001">Table S1</xref>). The forward fusion primer (Roche331F) was composed of Lib-L Primer A-key, ten-nucleotide MID tag (represented by x) and 16S rRNA specific sequence (bold); <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5<bold>′</bold>-CCATCTCATCCCTGCGTGTCTCCGACTCAG</named-content>-xxxxxxxxxx- <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple"><bold>TCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAGT</bold>-3<bold>′</bold></named-content>.

We selected MIDs to provide optimum primer design.</p>
<p>Amplification of the V3–V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was carried out in 25 µl reactions containing 1× FastStart High Fidelity Reaction Buffer with 1.8 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 200 µM of each dNTP, 400 nM of each primer, 2.5 U/µl of FastStart High Fidelity Enzyme Blend (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) and 5–250 ng of genomic DNA. Amplification was performed at 95°C for 2 min (denaturation), followed by 35 cycles of 95°C, 60°C and 72°C each for 30 s and a final elongation cycle of 72°C for 4 min. All PCR products were visually examined by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels.</p>
<p>Amplicons were HPLC purified (Agencourt AMPure, Beckman Coulter, Beverly, MA, USA), randomly quality controlled (2100 BioAnalyser, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and were sequenced unidirectionally using the GS FLX 454 Titanium platform, over two quarters of Pico Titer Plates™, at the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF Ltd., Brisbane, QLD, Australia).</p>

<title>Filtering, de-noising, chimera check, OTU picking, alignment and taxonomic assignment of 454 sequences</title>
<p>The sequences from the GS FLX Titanium run were processed using the QIIME (version 1.5.0) software package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Caporaso1">[44]</xref>. Quality filtering was performed to remove sequences which were either under 360 bp or over 460 bp, contained ambiguous bases, had primer or barcode mismatches, contained homopolymers which exceeded six bases or had an average quality score below 25. The sequence length range was determined by aligning the complete dataset, prior to quality filtering, to assess the length of the majority of sequences. The remaining sequences had an average length of 429 bp. The quality-filtered sequences were de-noised <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Quince1">[45]</xref> and chimera-checked <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Haas1">[46]</xref> to remove sequences containing errors produced during pyrosequencing and the PCR, respectively.</p>
<p>Quality filtered sequences were binned into operational taxonomic units (OTUs), which are terminal nodes in a phylogenetic analysis than can be determined at different levels. We used optimal UCLUST <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Edgar1">[47]</xref> at a 97% genetic similarity which is considered to be at species level resolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Acinas1">[48]</xref>. Representative sequences from each OTU were aligned using PyNAST <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Caporaso1">[44]</xref> against the GreenGenes core set, with a minimum length of 200 bp and identity of 80%. PyNAST aligns the short GS FLX generated sequences (360–460 bp) against the full 16S rRNA gene. We removed columns which solely contained gaps from the alignment prior to building phylogenetic trees. To overcome the difficulty in aligning highly variable 16S rRNA gene sequences, it is common to hide or lane-mask regions where at least 50% of the base composition is not conserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Weisburg1">[49]</xref>. We did not hide variable regions because lane-masked alignments can ‘mute’ the phylogenetic diversity observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Schloss1">[50]</xref>. The gap-filtered sequences were taxonomically assigned using the RDP classifier and nomenclature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Wang1">[51]</xref>. Taxonomic classifications were also checked against the HOMD database, for which we also used the RDP nomenclature. The gap-filtered alignments were used to generate a phylogenetic tree. The phylogeny was inferred using maximum likelihood in RAxML (version 7.0.4, CIPRES webserver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Stamatakis1">[52]</xref>).</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>We used linear mixed effects modelling to examine the relationship between pH and layer (fixed effects), allowing correlated slopes and intercepts to vary amongst individuals (random effects). The linear mixed effects model was fitted in R using the LME4 Package. Variation in oral microbiota among the pH groups was assessed by α-diversity (within group diversity), using both a phylogeny-based metric <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Faith1">[53]</xref> and the total number of OTUs. As the data were sequenced at various depths, rarefaction was performed. This involved performing ten sampling repetitions without replacement, at each sequencing depth (number of sequences). Rarefaction revealed a plateauing of diversity by 1000 sequences per sample. Hence, all samples were standardised to 1000 sequences per sample, to ensure comparability between samples for all analyses.</p>
<p>We used linear mixed effects modelling to assess the relationship between fixed effects, pH and α-diversity (phylogenetic diversity and number of OTUs at 1000 sequences/sample), allowing correlated slopes and intercepts to vary amongst individuals (random effects). The linear mixed effects models were fitted in R using the LME4 Package.</p>
<p>We used Random Forest (RF) analysis to identify which species differentiate a caries associated microbial community along the pH gradient, from acidic to neutral conditions. RF was performed on the abundance of OTUs in the caries-associated microbiota under the different pH groupings. To remove bias, the samples were rarefied so that each contained 1000 sequences and only included OTUs that were observed greater than five times in the complete dataset <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Yatsunenko1">[54]</xref>. The RF analysis was run in RF++, a RF algorithm that handles cluster correlated data (e.g. pH groups), with specification of repeated measures, in our case the layers per individual <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Karpievitch1">[55]</xref>. RF is a two-way comparison. As we had five pH groups, we performed a total of ten comparisons using RF analysis, to ensure all pH groups were compared to each other. We performed RF analysis using 5000 trees in the forest, and an out of bag estimate of error to determine the strength of classification of species as discriminatory. We determined that a species was discriminatory for a pH range if it had an importance score above 0.001 as in accordance with previous recommendations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Yatsunenko1">[54]</xref>.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We isolated DNA from 110 dentine samples to determine if there is a ‘core’ microbial population associated with dentine caries and to test if the oral microbial community is influenced by pH of the lesion. The DNA samples were used to generate 16S gene (V3–V4 region) amplicons that were sequenced using 454 technology to construct genomic libraries. From two quarters of a plate (equivalent to half a plate in 454 run) in two separate runs, a total of 449,762 raw sequences were acquired by pyrosequencing that was reduced after quality filtering, de-noising and chimera checking by 14.9%, 0.8% and 19.2%, respectively. A total of 296,534 working sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092940.s002">Table S2</xref>) with an average read length of 429 base pairs were obtained. The average number of reads per sample was 3420 sequences post quality filtering. The sequence data is available in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), accession number PRJEB5178 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB5178" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB5178</ext-link>).</p>
<p>The sequences were clustered into species level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 3% genetic distance. Within the data, clustering identified the presence of 409 species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092940.s003">Table S3</xref>) assigned to 9 phyla and 97 genera. The dominant phyla in the dentine caries lesions were Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes, accounting for 95% of sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092940-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The phyla which accounted for the remaining 5% of sequences included Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, Spirochaetes, TM7 and SR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092940-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

<p>To examine whether there was a ‘core’ microbiome associated with dentine caries, the level of shared OTUs among individuals was compared. Some 50.5%+/−17.6% of OTUs were shared among the dentine caries samples from the 25 individuals investigated. As multiple (four to five) microbial DNA extracts were available per individual, it was also possible to compare the degree of inter- to intra-individual variation within the caries microbial community. We found that 65.0%+/−15.5% of OTUs were shared within an individual between the different sample layers. These results indicate a large degree of overlap in the dentine caries microbiome between individuals.</p>
<p>To determine variation in pH from the most superficial (layer 1) to the deepest (layer 5) zone of the lesion we used linear mixed effects modelling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092940.s004">Table S4</xref>). This analysis revealed a highly significant relationship between the lesion depth and pH. The most superficial zone was found to be significantly more acidic than the deepest areas of the lesion sampled (p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092940.s004">Table S4a</xref>).</p>
<p>To test whether the microbial community composition associated with dentine caries was influenced by the changing pH within the lesion, we compared the degree of shared sequences within groups, also termed <italic>α</italic>-diversity, by both a phylogenetic diversity metric and the overall number OTUs. Linear mixed effects modelling of <italic>α</italic>-diversity (1000 sequences/sample) and pH revealed that bacterial communities from carious lesions under more acidic compared to more neutral conditions had severely reduced phylogenetic diversity (p&lt;0.0001 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092940.s004">Table S4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092940-g002">Figure 2a</xref>) and less numbers of different OTUs (p = 0.0319 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092940.s004">Table S4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092940-g002">Figure 2b</xref>).</p>

<p>The overall disparity in diversity observed between microbial communities under acidic and neutral conditions was associated with changes at both the phylum and genus level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092940-g003">Figure 3</xref>). For all abundance comparisons, samples were standardised to contain 1000 sequences per sample. While Firmicutes were the most dominant phylum across all pH groups, they were present in higher proportions in the most acidic conditions (78%, pH 4.5–5.0), compared to less acidic conditions (36–53%, pH 5.0–&gt;6.5). In communities from the most acidic lesion samples, the Firmicutes phylum was primarily represented by the <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> (77%) genus. In comparison, microbial populations from zones above pH 5.5 had lower frequencies of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> (22–40%), and greater amounts of <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, <italic>Pseudoramibacter</italic> and <italic>Dialister</italic>. As the proportion of Firmicutes in the caries microbiome decreased with increasing pH, other phyla became more dominant, including Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092940-g003">Figure 3a</xref>). Despite the low abundance of Proteobacteria within all pH groups, numerous genera within this phylum were detected at more neutral pH ranges (&gt;6.0, 10.6%), creating high heterogeneity of genera detected in caries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092940-g003">Figure 3b</xref>). Across the pH gradient the proportion of Actinobacteria remained relatively constant (21–45%). Within the Actinobacteria phylum, the dominant genus observed in the caries dentine samples was <italic>Atopobium</italic>.

<p>Random Forest (RF) analysis was used to identify which species differentiate a dentine caries community that is under acidic or neutral conditions. RF is a classifier that recognises patterns, non-linear relationships and dependencies between data, in our case OTUs, within complex datasets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Knights1">[56]</xref>. The goal of RF is to classify the input data, given the known groupings, assess the strength of this classification and identify features which are important to the classification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Knights1">[56]</xref>. As the grouping classification (pH range) was known, this method was used to identify the OTUs that best discriminated microbial communities at different pH ranges. This analysis also identified those species that did not discriminate between pH groups, and hence could be identified as common/core species present in dentine caries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092940.s005">Table S5</xref>).</p>
<p>RF revealed that 2 species were highly predictive of communities associated with the most acidic conditions (pH group 1, 4.5–5.0), and 20 species were highly predictive of neutral (pH group 5, &gt;6.5) pH-associated communities (error rate, 16.1%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092940.s005">Table S5</xref>). Anchor species for the most acidic pH range included <italic>L. fermentum</italic> (Importance Score = 0.0401) and <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> (Importance Score = 0.013).

There were also predictive species for communities associated with a mid-range pH (5.0–6.0) compared to neutral pH conditions. We found that 9 species were predictive for communities associated with a pH range of 5.0–5.5 (error rate, 20%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092940.s005">Table S5</xref>), dominated by <italic>Prevotella</italic> and <italic>Actinomyces</italic> species. As the pH became less acidic (pH range of 5.5–6.0) 5 predictive species (error rate, 48.1%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092940.s005">Table S5</xref>) were identified.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The composition of dentine caries-associated microbiota was observed to shift with pH gradient, supporting the postulate of the extended ecological plaque hypothesis. The finding of a core population of bacteria, unaffected by pH, has enabled us to propose a ‘substantial core model’ for dentine caries. By detailed investigation, we were able to draw broad conclusions regarding variation in the oral bacterial community between cavitated lesions and biofilms associated with health and caries. Further, by linking data to an ecological variable, pH, it was possible to infer the relationship between dentine caries, pH and the microbiota.</p>
<p>While technically, the inclusion of plaque bacterial population and plaque pH from healthy subjects may provide a control, we found this comparison of little biological relevance for the question of carious dentine and pH. In other words, we only present the bacterial population in the very late stages of caries and its relevance to the pH of the lesion. In plaque bacterial studies, the bacterial population can be compared in active or inactive disease states or between caries-free and caries-active individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Yang1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Jiang1">[57]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Griffen1">[59]</xref>. However, unlike plaque studies, there is no equivalent biologic control available for an established lesion where the bacterial DNA is directly extracted from the caries mass. Hence, we used published literature on health and caries to compare broadly to our dentine caries study.</p>

<title>Caries-associated microbiota is lower in diversity than health-associated oral microbiota</title>
<p>Comparison of the bacterial profile in the present study to data available for oral biofilms associated with health indicates substantial differences in community diversity regardless of pH of the lesion, which is not yet addressed in current literature. We found that caries- compared to health-associated microbiota is lower in diversity and varied in composition at both the broad (phylum) and detailed (genus) level. The carious lesions we investigated contained between 15% to 50% of the total number of OTUs recorded from pyrosequencing analysis of plaque and saliva samples from healthy sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Keijser1">[60]</xref> and healthy mucosal biofilms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Zaura1">[58]</xref>, respectively. While Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes accounted for 95% of sequences in our investigated carious lesions, these phyla comprised only 68% of sequences from healthy sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Zaura1">[58]</xref>. A major disparity at the phylum level related to Proteobacteria which accounted for 15–22% of bacteria in healthy sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Zaura1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Keijser1">[60]</xref>, but only 4.4% of the sequences from carious lesions.

While the greater microbial diversity in healthy sites compared to carious lesions was related to higher levels of the above outlined genera, we did find a selection of genera that were exclusively abundant in dentine caries: <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, <italic>Atopobium</italic>, <italic>Olsenella</italic>, <italic>Propionibacterium</italic>, <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>, <italic>Dialister</italic>, <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> and <italic>Parascardovia</italic>.</p>

<title>The microbial population in cavitated lesions of dentine is different from non-cavitated caries samples</title>
<p>Previous investigations of caries-associated microbiota have primarily analysed saliva <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Yang1">[31]</xref> or plaque <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-BeldaFerre1">[33]</xref>. While the oral microbiota is a continuum, community composition is known to vary at different intra-oral sites due to varying ecological conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Bik1">[61]</xref>. We found that caries-associated microbial populations from the active site of decay differed from non-active site samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Yang1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-BeldaFerre1">[33]</xref> being lower in diversity and varied in community structure. For instance, pyrosequencing analysis of saliva microbiota from caries-active individuals revealed highly diverse communities, comprising 600 to 4200 species-level phylotypes in each sample, with great inter-individual variation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Yang1">[31]</xref>. We found a much less diverse microbial community within cavitated carious lesions, with 5 to 66 phylotypes recorded per sample, and a high representation of shared species (50.5%+/−17.6%) between individuals. Our findings more closely match results from pyrosequencing analysis of plaque samples adjacent to the margin of the cavity that contained between 73–120 OTUs per sample <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-BeldaFerre1">[33]</xref>. The diversity difference observed in the carious lesion compared to non-active site samples indicates that the site of sampling influences the interpretation of the relationship between microbiota and disease.</p>
<p>The variation in reported microbiota diversity between the present study and others due to sample type, impacts significantly on the interpretation of which taxa are associated with disease. As an example, <italic>Prevotella</italic> was the only over-abundant (25%) genus reported in saliva samples from caries-active individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Yang1">[31]</xref>.

However, Random Forest analysis revealed that members of the <italic>Prevotella</italic> genus including <italic>Prevotella</italic> sp. (strain B31FD), <italic>P. histicola</italic> and <italic>P. multisaccharivorax</italic> were distinctive of more acidic pH ranges in carious dentine, while other <italic>Prevotella</italic> species, such as <italic>P. buccae</italic>, <italic>P. dentalis</italic> and <italic>P. nigrescens</italic>, were shared among the core microbiota (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092940.s006">Table S6</xref>).

<p>We also found a substantial proportion (58%) of dentine caries-associated taxa were present along the pH gradient from 4.5–7.

The microbiota associated with the most acidic pH ranges, including <italic>L. fermentum</italic> and <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic>, potentially represent taxa that are important for progression of the lesion.

<title>Summary</title>
<p>The carious process is a continuum of events and this study presents a portion of this continuum from a novel perspective. Consortium behaviour within a bacterial community depends on environmental variables that have been overlooked in previous studies. The pH of the environment can be a result of acidogenicity of bacteria combined with or without imposed pH from external sources, such as food and beverages. Nonetheless, it is believed that a constant interaction between the two exists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092940-Takahashi1">[26]</xref> in which the substrate availability can further direct and impose a shift in bacterial population and a sustained ecology, leading to caries progression. As stated earlier, we propose that without taking into account a defining ecological variable, such as pH of the environment, a cross-sectional bacterial analysis of caries microbiota, although still informative, remains deficient to assign a key role for specific bacteria, unless a longitudinal analysis of bacteria is carried out at different stages of the caries process. We addressed this issue by comprehensively cataloguing bacteria associated with carious lesions and considering the influence of pH, on microbial composition. Our proposed ‘substantial core model’ identifies pH-distinctive taxa and demonstrates bacterial diversity changes from acidic to neutral pH gradients. The presence of numerous species that are not discriminatory of pH and are omnipresent in this ecology represents the core of the bacterial consortium in dentine caries with respect to pH. The present in-depth report of bacterial community constitution affirms the ecological plaque hypothesis at the <italic>in vivo</italic> level.</p>
