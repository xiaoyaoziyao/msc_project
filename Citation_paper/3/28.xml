<abstract>
<p>The role of forest plantations in biodiversity conservation has gained more attention in recent years. However, most work on evaluating the diversity of forest plantations focuses only on one spatial scale; thus, we examined the effects of sampling scale on diversity in forest plantations. We designed a hierarchical sampling strategy to collect data on woody species diversity in planted pine (<italic>Pinus tabuliformis</italic> Carr.), planted larch (<italic>Larix principis-rupprechtii</italic> Mayr.), and natural secondary deciduous broadleaf forests in a mountainous region of Beijing, China. Additive diversity partition analysis showed that, compared to natural forests, the planted pine forests had a different woody species diversity partitioning pattern at multi-scales (except the Simpson diversity in the regeneration layer), while the larch plantations did not show multi-scale diversity partitioning patterns that were obviously different from those in the natural secondary broadleaf forest. Compare to the natural secondary broadleaf forests, the effects of planted pine forests on woody species diversity are dependent on the sampling scale and layers selected for analysis. Diversity in the planted larch forest, however, was not significantly different from that in the natural forest for all diversity components at all sampling levels. Our work demonstrated that the species selected for afforestation and the sampling scales selected for data analysis alter the conclusions on the levels of diversity supported by plantations. We suggest that a wide range of scales should be considered in the evaluation of the role of forest plantations on biodiversity conservation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Forests are vital to the conservation of terrestrial biodiversity, as more than a quarter of the earth's land surface is covered by forests, and more than half of the earth's terrestrial species dwell in or depend on these forests <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Hassan1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-FAO1">[2]</xref>. However, in many regions, the ratio of natural forest is low due to anthropogenic activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-UNEP1">[3]</xref>, which has made modified forests an important component in preventing the loss of biodiversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Eycott1">[4]</xref>. Planted forests, a subset of modified forests, are being expanded in area annually to combat the global trend in shrinking forest cover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-FAO1">[2]</xref>. The role of forest plantations in supporting biodiversity is critically important in regions where natural forests have become highly modified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Oxbrough1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Irwin1">[6]</xref>. However, knowledge about plantations in biodiversity conservation is incomplete and their contribution to such conservation is still arguable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Brockerhoff1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Brockerhoff2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Bremer1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Pawson1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Verstraeten1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>The value of forest plantations in biodiversity conservation has been found to be context dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Brockerhoff1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Parrotta1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Lamb1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Carnus1">[14]</xref>. In their recent work, Bremer and Farley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Bremer1">[9]</xref> used 126 observations from 36 published works to conduct a quantitative synthesis of the effects of forest plantations on plant richness. They found that the effects of plantations on plant richness varied considerably depending on whether the original land cover was grassland, shrub land, primary forest, secondary forest, or degraded or exotic pasture, and whether native or exotic tree species had been planted. They suggested that plantations have positive effects on plant diversity when established on degraded lands by comparison to when they are used to replace natural ecosystems (such as forests, grasslands, and shrub lands), and when indigenous rather than exotic tree species are used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Bremer1">[9]</xref>. These results provide useful information with respect to which land types and species should be selected for afforestation in order to achieve optimal biodiversity outcomes. However, the cases selected for their analysis focused on only one spatial scale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Bremer1">[9]</xref>, as has almost all previous research. In fact, Brockerhoff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Brockerhoff1">[7]</xref> and Hartmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Hartmann1">[15]</xref> pointed out that the negative or positive effects of plantations on biodiversity are scale dependent. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no attempts to address this scale dependency issue. There is an urgent need for multi-scale evaluations to assess the influence of planted forests on biodiversity and to identify the appropriate spatial scale at which management efforts should be implemented in order to obtain favorable biodiversity outcomes.</p>
<p>The rationale for such assessments is that biodiversity distribution in heterogeneous landscapes is the result of different processes operating at different scales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Levin1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Crawley1">[17]</xref>, such that the effects of these processes on the distribution pattern of biodiversity may change with scale. A multi-scale analysis of diversity makes it possible to identify the spatial scale at which a forest plantation has a positive (or negative) effect on biodiversity and, therefore, the appropriate spatial scale at which the management strategy for an optimal biodiversity outcome should be designed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Gering1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Chandy1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Gabriel1">[20]</xref>. The additive diversity partitioning approach is an ideal candidate for the quantification of diversity across multiple spatial scales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Lande1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Wagner1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Crist1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Veech1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Crist2">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the additive diversity partitioning approach, the total species diversity (gamma diversity, <italic>γ</italic>) is the sum of within-community diversity (alpha diversity, α) and between-community diversity (beta diversity, <italic>β</italic>), i.e., <italic>γ</italic> = <italic>α</italic>+<italic>β</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Lande1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-MacArthur1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Allan1">[27]</xref>. This approach treats alpha diversity as the average within-community diversity, regardless of whether diversity is measured by species richness or Simpson's diversity index. Beta diversity is thus not the average amount of diversity found in a single, randomly chosen unit, or the average diversity missing from a community, but that which is present in the total diversity of all other communities in the assemblage. Therefore, alpha and beta diversity are commensurate and can be compared directly, so that the partitioning can be applied at any spatial scale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Veech1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>In our study, to partition patterns of woody species diversity, we designed a hierarchical sampling system including four levels: plot, slope position, slope, and watershed (corresponding to different sampling scales). The watershed is a basic geohydrological unit in a mountainous region that is used for effective ecological management practices to sustain and enhance ecosystem functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Hornbeck1">[28]</xref>. Slope and slope position were selected as a level of analysis in the hierarchical sampling system because these factors can determine the distribution patterns of species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Fu1">[29]</xref>. Furthermore, these factors could potentially be used in forest management strategies to select the location of plantations. To analyze the effects of forest plantations on woody species diversity, we selected 9 small watersheds, 3 were planted pine (<italic>Pinus tabuliformis</italic> Carr.) forest, 3 were planted larch (<italic>Larix principis-rupprechtii</italic> Mayr.) forest, and 3 were natural secondary broadleaf forest. We hypothesized that the effects of forest plantations on woody species diversity (tree, shrub, and regeneration layers) would vary with sampling scales. We compared the multi-scale partitioning patterns of woody species diversity using the additive diversity partitioning approach. We tested and compared the difference of all species diversity components (alpha, beta, and gamma diversity) among forest types using mixed-effect models and multiple comparisons.</p>

<title>Study area</title>
<p>The study was conducted on Donglingshan Mountain, an extension of the Xiaowutaishan Mountains belonging to the broader Taihangshan Mountains, 100 km northwest of Beijing City, China. The study area, within Beijing Xiaolongmen National Forest Park, is located at 39°57'53" N and 115°26'05" E. The soil type in the area is brown soil, classified as Eutriccambisol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-FAOUNESCO1">[30]</xref>. The area has a typical warm, temperate, continental monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation of 500–650 mm. The mean annual temperature is 5–10°C. The altitude of most of the area is greater than 1000 m above sea level, with the highest peak at 2303 m.</p>
<p>The zonal vegetation is highly heterogeneous, warm temperate zone deciduous broadleaf forest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Chen1">[31]</xref>, including primarily oaks (<italic>Quercus</italic> spp.), mixed species (e.g., <italic>Tilia</italic> spp., <italic>Ulmus</italic> spp., <italic>Acer</italic> spp., <italic>Juglans mandshurica</italic> and <italic>Fraxinus rhynchophylla</italic>), birches (<italic>Betula</italic> spp.) and poplar (<italic>Populus davidiana</italic>). There are also pine (<italic>P. tabuliformis</italic> Carr.) and larch (<italic>L. principis-rupprechtii</italic> Mayr.) forest plantations that were established during the late1950s. During this period, most natural broadleaf forests were clear-cut for the steel industry. After deforestation, some of the small watersheds in the area were planted with pines (<italic>P. tabuliformis</italic> Carr.), while others were planted with larch (<italic>L. principis-rupprechtii</italic> Mayr.); still others are secondary broadleaf forest that recovered naturally. The primary purpose of the plantations has been for wood production. Now, since the establishment of the nature reserve in 1985, which then became a forest park in 1994, all of the forests in this area—both natural and planted—serve roles in biodiversity conservation, soil and water conservation, and carbon sequestration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Ma1">[32]</xref>.</p>

<title>Sampling design and data collection</title>
<p>We designed a hierarchically nested sampling system to collect data on woody species diversity in the study area. The system included 4 hierarchical levels: plot, slope position, slope, and watershed (corresponding to spatial scales). The highest level was the watershed. In this region, most watersheds have only two main slope exposures, with areas ranging in size from 20–30 ha. We selected 9 such watersheds, with primarily eastern and western slope exposures: 3 were pine (<italic>P. tabuliformis</italic> Carr.) plantations, 3 were larch (<italic>L. principis-rupprechtii</italic> Mayr.) plantations, and 3 were natural secondary broadleaf forests (recovered naturally after the clear-cutting). The natural secondary broadleaf forest selected in this work was ideal as the control for the comparison of the effects of plantations on woody species diversity. In each watershed, two slopes (eastern and western exposures) were nested; in each slope, three slope positions (upper, middle, lower) were nested; and in each slope position, 5 10 m×10 m plots were selected for data collection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115038-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). In each plot, species were recorded separately at the tree, shrub, and regeneration layers. In the tree layer, the species name, height, and coverage of all individual trees with a height of more than 3 m were recorded; in the shrub layer, the species name, abundance, height, and coverage of all shrub species were recorded, and in the regeneration layer, the species name, height, and coverage of all individual trees smaller than 3 m were recorded. In total, 30 plots (5 plots/slope positions ×3 slope positions/slope ×2 slopes/watershed) were collected in each watershed. A total of 270 plots were collected, comprising 54 samples of slope position, 18 samples of slope, and 9 samples of watershed for the data analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115038-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). All field work was conducted during the summer (July and August) of 2011 and 2013.</p>

<p>The hierarchical sampling system included 4 levels (corresponding to spatial scales): 270 sampling units at the plot scale were nested within 54 sampling units at the slope position scale; 54 sampling units at the slope position scale were nested within 18 sampling units of slope scale, and 18 sampling units at the slope scale were nested within 9 sampling units at the watershed scale. For the 9 watersheds, 3 watersheds were planted in pine forest, 3 in larch forest, and 3 were natural secondary broad-leaved forest.</p>

<title>Multi-scale partitioning of diversity</title>
<p>It is well known that there are two different perspectives in diversity partitioning: multiplicative and additive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Ellison1">[33]</xref>. There has been extensive discussion of which perspective is better for partitioning “independent” beta diversity (see a recent Forum in <italic>Ecology</italic> edited by Ellisonand papers in it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Ellison1">[33]</xref>), but both perspectives have advantages and disadvantages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Ricotta1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Veech2">[35]</xref>. In the additive partitioning approach, all diversity components have the same unit, which makes it possible to compare different diversity components at multiple scales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Lande1">[21]</xref>. Therefore, we used the additive approach in our work. According to the hierarchical model of additive partitioning, gamma diversity (the diversity in a watershed) can be partitioned into its alpha and beta components at four spatial scales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115038-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). In each hierarchical level, we partitioned the total woody species diversity observed in the tree, shrub, and regeneration layers into within-scale (alpha diversity) and between-scale diversity (beta diversity). At the lowest sampling level, the plot level, the within-plot diversity (alpha1) is the mean species diversity in a plot (per plot in a slope position level) and the between-plot diversity (beta1) is determined by subtracting the within-plot diversity (alpha1) from the species diversity in pooled plots (all 5 plots per slope position). Similarly, the within-slope position diversity (alpha2) is the mean species diversity in the slope position (per slope position on a slope) and the between-slope position diversity (beta2) is determined by subtracting the within-slope position diversity (alpha2) from the species diversity in the pooled slope position (all 3 slope positions per slope). The within-slope position diversity (alpha3) is the mean species diversity in a slope (per slope in a watershed) and the between-slope diversity (beta3) is determined by subtracting the within-slope position diversity (alpha3) from the species diversity in pooled slopes (2 slopes per watershed, resulting in the gamma diversity). Thus, the total diversity (gamma diversity) in the watershed can be partitioned as: gamma  =  alpha1+ beta1+ beta2+ beta3.</p>

<p>Species richness and Simpson's diversity index were selected as the two measures of diversity for woody species in this work. Previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-ChazdonR1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Finegan1">[37]</xref> have suggested that species richness recovers much faster than species composition in secondary forests or plantation forests. Species richness reflects only the presence or absence of a species in a community (or ecological assemblage), while Simpson's diversity index can reflect the species composition of a community (or ecological assemblage). The Simpson's diversity index is calculated by the following equation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Magurran1">[38]</xref>:</p>

<p>The variability in different diversity components (alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, beta1, beta2, beta3, gamma; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115038.s001">S1 Appendix</xref> for the data used in this study) for each layer (tree, shrub, and regeneration layer) was analyzed using the mixed-effect model, which accounts for non-independent errors caused by the hierarchically nested sampling method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Gabriel1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-ChazdonR1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Zuur1">[40]</xref>. According to the diversity components used for analysis, forest type, slope, and slope position, as well as their first-order interactions, were set as fixed effects; the watersheds, which differ in area and environmental conditions that may cause differences in species diversity were set as random effects, while slope nested in watershed, and slope position nested in slope, were set initially as random effects (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0115038-t001">Table 1</xref>). The best-fit models for all diversity components in the different woody species layers were determined by likelihood ratio tests in two steps: first, the random effect variables simplification was performed. The random effects were dropped from the highest hierarchical sampling level (watershed) to the lowest sampling level step by step until the drop produced a significant decrease in the model's likelihood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Finegan1">[37]</xref>; second, the fixed effects variables simplification was conducted. After the simplification of random effects variables, the non-significant fixed effects variables or interactions were dropped from the model step by step until, when dropped, all variables included in the model produced a significant decrease in the model's likelihood. However, the non-significant variables included in significant interactions were not removed from the models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Crawley2">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Concepcin1">[42]</xref>.

The significance of fixed effect was calculated using ‘lmerTest’ package<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Kuznetsova1">[43]</xref> and the linear mixed model was fitted by ‘lme4’package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Bates1">[44]</xref> in R.

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 70 woody species were recorded at the study site, of which 31 were in the tree layer, 39 were in the shrub layer and 27 were in the regeneration layer. There was a total of 58 species recorded in the natural secondary broadleaf forest, 27 in the tree layer, 31 in the shrub layer, and 20 in the regeneration layer. In the larch forest plantation, the total number of species recorded was 57, 22 in the tree layer, 35 in shrub layer, and 19 in regeneration layer. In the pine forest plantations, the corresponding numbers were 32, 15, 17, and 17. With respect to the multi-scale partitioning pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115038-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), in the pine plantations, the contribution sequence to a watershed's species richness was alpha1&gt; beta1&gt; beta2&gt; beta3 for all three layers, while the sequence in natural secondary broadleaf forests and larch plantations was beta1&gt; beta3&gt; beta2&gt; alpha1 in the tree and shrub layers and beta1&gt; beta2&gt; beta3&gt; alpha1 in the regeneration layer. For the Simpson's diversity, the highest contribution to the watershed diversity was alpha1 in all three layers for all forest types; the contribution sequence of the beta diversity components for pine forest plantations was beta1&gt; beta2&gt; beta3 in all three layers; the sequence in natural secondary forests and planted larch forests was the same as in planted pine forests in the regeneration layer, but in the tree and shrub layers, the sequence was beta1&gt; beta3&gt; beta2.</p>

<p>The results of the mixed-effects models for within-scale diversity components (alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, and gamma) are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0115038-t002">Table 2</xref>. In the tree layer, the forest types showed significant differences in species richness and Simpson's diversity for all within-scale diversity components. In the shrub layer, the forest types showed significant differences in species richness at the plot and watershed sampling scales (alpah1and gamma), while they showed significant differences in Simpson's diversity only at the plot sampling scale (alpha1). In the regeneration layer, the forest types showed significant differences in species richness and Simpson's diversity only at the slope position sampling scale (alpha2). Slope had significant effects on species richness in the tree layer and on Simpson's diversity in the regeneration layer at the plot sampling scale (alpha1). The first-order interactions of forest type and slope showed significant differences in species richness at the plot scale (alpha1) in the tree layer, while the first-order interactions of forest type and slope position showed significant differences in species richness at the plot sampling scale (alpha1) in the tree layer.</p>

<p>The results of the mixed-effects models for between-scale diversity components (beta1, beta2, beta3; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0115038-t003">Table 3</xref>) showed significant differences in beta diversity measured by species richness at the plot sampling scale (beta1) and significant differences in beta diversity measured by Simpson's diversity were found at the slope sampling scale (beta3) for forest type in the tree layer. In the shrub layer, beta diversity measured by species richness was significant for forest type at the slope sampling scale (beta3). For beta diversity measured by Simpson's diversity, significant differences among forest types were found at the slope position sampling scale (beta2). In the regeneration layer, significant differences in the beta diversity (measured both by species richness and Simpson's diversity) were found at the plot sampling scale (beta1) for all forest types. Slope position demonstrated significant differences at the plot sampling scale (beta1) in the tree and shrub layers for beta diversity measured by species richness. First-order interactions for forest type and slope position showed significant differences at the plot sampling scale (beta1) in the regeneration layer for beta diversity measured by species richness. The differences in the within-scale diversity components among forest types are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115038-g004">Figs. 4</xref> (species richness) and 5 (Simpson's diversity). Compared to the other forest types, species diversity (species richness and Simpson's diversity) in the tree layer in the pine plantations was significantly lower than in the natural secondary broadleaf forests and larch plantations for all within-scale diversity components. In the shrub layer, the species richness in the pine forest plantations was significantly lower than in the natural secondary broadleaf forests and planted larch forests at slope (alpha3) and watershed (gamma) sampling levels, but the species richness was significantly higher than in the planted larch forests at the plot (alpha1) sampling level; the Simpson's diversity in the planted pine forests was significantly higher than in the planted larch forest at the plot (alpha1) and slope (alpha3) sampling levels. In the regeneration layer, the species richness in the pine forest plantations was significantly lower than in the natural secondary broadleaf forests and larch forest plantations at the slope position (alpha2) sampling scale; the Simpson's diversity in planted pine forests was significantly lower than in the natural secondary broadleaf forests and planted larch forests at the slope position (alpha2), slope (alpha3) and watershed (gamma) sampling scales.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The additive diversity partitioning method is a powerful approach in diversity pattern analysis across spatial scales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Chandy1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Gabriel1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Crist1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Concepcin1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Golodets1">[46]</xref>. We assessed the effects of forest plantations on patterns of woody species diversity partitioning with this hierarchical multi-scale approach. Our work showed that the multi-scale diversity partitioning patterns in a watershed differed among forest types. In a watershed, the pine plantations (<italic>P. tabuliformis</italic> Carr.) changed the multi-scale diversity partitioning pattern of woody species diversity (except the Simpson diversity in the regeneration layer) compared to natural secondary broadleaf forest, while the larch plantations (<italic>L. principis-rupprechti</italic>) did not show multi-scale diversity partitioning patterns that were obviously different from those in the natural secondary broadleaf forest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115038-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Our results highlight the fact that forest plantations affect plant diversity at multiple scales, thereby reemphasizing the necessity of taking multiple spatial scales into account in the assessment of the effects of forest plantations on biodiversity conservation.</p>
<p>Our work verified, in part, our hypothesis that the effects of forest plantations on woody species diversity depend on the sampling scale selected. For within-diversity components (alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, gamma), the significance of the difference among forest types was dependent on the sampling scale selected in the shrub and regeneration layers, although not in the tree layer which showed significant differences among forest types for all within-diversity components (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0115038-t002">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115038-g004">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115038-g005">5</xref>). For between-diversity components (beta1, beta2, beta3), the significance of the difference was dependent for all layers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0115038-t003">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115038-g006">Figs. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115038-g007">7</xref>). This is the first work that provides direct evidence for the recent hypothesis that the effects of forest plantations on diversity might be scale-dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Brockerhoff1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Hartmann1">[15]</xref>.

<p>Previous work has shown that the effects of forest plantations are also dependent on the species selected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Bremer1">[9]</xref>. Our results were consistent with those studies, in that the larch plantations (<italic>L. principis-rupprechtii</italic>) did not have significant difference from the natural secondary broadleaf forest, while the pine plantations (<italic>P. tabuliformis</italic>) had different effects on woody species richness at different sampling scales compare to natural secondary broadleaf forest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115038-g004">Figs. 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115038-g007">7</xref>). This suggests that the characteristics of a dominant species play a critical role in plantations with respect to species diversity. Compared to larch (<italic>L. principis-rupprechtii</italic>) and broadleaf deciduous species, pine (<italic>P. tabuliformis</italic>) is an evergreen, which changes seasonal light schemes, especially during the non-growing season, ultimately increasing the homogeneity of the light environment for woody species. As biotic homogenization has been suggested to be a threat to biodiversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Smart1">[48]</xref>, it is not surprising that the value of beta diversity components in the planted pine forest were nearly the lowest among the forest types (except beta2 in the shrub layer measured by Simpson's diversity; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115038-g006">Figs. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115038-g007">7</xref>).</p>
<p>In most regions, forest plantations were designed for degraded ecosystem recovery and biodiversity conservation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Brockerhoff1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Hartmann1">[15]</xref>. The results of our work showed that the pine forest plantations in watersheds change the diversity pattern of woody species (but not for the Simpson diversity in the regeneration layer) and decrease woody species diversity (the significant effects showed at different sampling scales), while a watershed planted with larch does not change the diversity pattern or decrease the diversity compared to the natural forests. In a watershed, slope exposure and slope position are very important indirect factors governing the output of diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Fu1">[29]</xref>. When we take the slope exposure into consideration, the larch plantations had a significantly higher value of woody species diversity (alpha diversity in the tree layer, beta diversity measure by species richness for all layers, beta diversity measured by Simpson's diversity at the shrub layer) than did the pine plantations on the eastern exposure of a watershed. On the western exposure slope of a watershed, our work showed that the pine plantations lowered the alpha diversity in the tree layer and beta diversity in the regeneration layer significantly by comparison to the natural secondary broadleaf forest. When slope exposure and position were both taken into consideration, we found that the pine plantations decreased the alpha diversity at the upper slope position in the tree layer and the beta diversity at the middle slope position in the regeneration layer on the western exposure of the slope significantly, while on the eastern exposure of a slope, the pine plantations at the middle slope position significantly decreased alpha diversity in the tree layer compare to the larch plantations and beta diversity in the regeneration layer compare to the larch plantations natural secondary broadleaf forests, but increased the alpha diversity (Simpson's diversity) at the lower slope position significantly compared to the natural secondary broadleaf forests. These results suggest that slope exposure and position are important in assessing the woody species diversity of plantations in mountainous regions. These results have potential practical value in guiding afforestation plans for this region. When the minimum management unit for the afforestation plan is the watershed, our work suggests that larch plantations or natural recovery of broadleaf forest are preferable. When the minimum management unit scale is reduced to the slope level, larch plantations are recommended on the eastern exposure rather than pine plantations. When the minimum management unit scale is reduced further to the slope position level, pine plantations in the upper and middle slope positions on western exposures, and in the middle slope position on eastern exposure of a slope are not recommended; instead, the natural forest should be allowed to recover.</p>
<p>There is increasing recognition that ecosystems and their services need to be managed in the face of landscape change <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Gabriel2">[49]</xref>. Forest plantations, a unique land type used to potentially counteract the worldwide decline in forested area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-FAO1">[2]</xref>, play critical roles in maintaining ecological functions, especially in mountainous regions. The watershed is not only a basic geohydrological unit, but also a unit for forest management in mountainous areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115038-Hornbeck1">[28]</xref>. With this new multi-scale strategy, focus has to be pointed at the impact of biodiversity within the watershed of planted forest. Our study points to the importance of sampling scale and species selection in assessing the influence of plantations on woody species diversity in afforestation area.</p>
