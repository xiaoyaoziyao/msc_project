<abstract>
<p>Anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL) are mainly characterized by harboring the fusion protein nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK). The ALK inhibitor, crizotinib specifically induced apoptosis in Ba/F3 cells expressing NPM-ALK by inhibiting the activation of NPM-ALK and its downstream molecule, signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 3 (STAT3). We found that α-tocopherol, a major component of vitamin E, attenuated the effects of crizotinib independently of its anti-oxidant properties. Although α-tocopherol suppressed the inhibitory effects of crizotinib on the signaling axis including NPM-ALK and STAT3, it had no influence on the intake of crizotinib into cells. Crizotinib also directly inhibited the kinase activity of NPM-ALK; however, this inhibitory effect was not altered by the co-treatment with α-tocopherol. Whereas the nuclear localization of NPM-ALK was disappeared by the treatment with crizotinib, the co-treatment with α-tocopherol swept the effect of crizotinib and caused the localization of NPM-ALK in nucleus. The administration of α-tocopherol attenuated the anti-tumor activity of crizotinib against NPM-ALK-provoked tumorigenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, the α-tocopherol-induced inhibition of crizotinib-caused apoptosis was also observed in NPM-ALK-positive cells derived from ALCL patients, namely, SUDHL-1 and Ki-JK. Collectively, these results not only revealed the novel mechanism underlying crizotinib-induced apoptosis in NPM-ALK-positive cells, but also suggest that the anti-tumor effects of crizotinib are attenuated when it is taken in combination with vitamin E.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor-type protein tyrosine kinase that belongs to the insulin-receptor superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref001">1</xref>]. ALK shows high sequence similarity to receptor tyrosine kinases such as LTK and ROS1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref003">3</xref>]. Alterations in ALK gene including chromosomal translocations, mutations, and overexpression have been implicated in the development of ALK-positive human cancers including anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL) and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Among the ALK-positive ALCL patients, approximately 80% harbor the t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref004">4</xref>], causing the expression of nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK). NPM-ALK includes N-terminal oligomerization domain of NPM and C-terminal kinase domain of ALK. By mediated N-terminal NPM region, the NPM-ALK automatically forms a dimer, and exhibits disordered activation, which is essential for cellular transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref005">5</xref>]. NPM-ALK triggers the activation of various pro-survival signaling pathways such as signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 3 (STAT3) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which are involved in cell cycle progression, proliferation, survival, and oncogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref007">7</xref>]. In 2007, ALK was shown to fuse to echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4), yielding the fusion kinase EML4-ALK detected in approximately 3–5% of NSCLC. Similar to NPM-ALK, EML4-ALK constitutively formed dimers and exhibited oncogenic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Crizotinib is an orally available ALK inhibitor that directly inhibits the kinase activity of ALK, and also suppresses receptor tyrosine kinases including c-Met and ROS1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref010">10</xref>]. Crizotinib was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ALK-positive NSCLC in 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref010">10</xref>]. Previous case reports showed that crizotinib was effective in the treatment of ALCL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref012">12</xref>]. The mechanisms by which crizotinib exhibits its anti-tumor activity against various tumors harboring the mutation in ALK genes currently remain unclear. A recent study reported that a treatment with crizotinib resulted in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref013">13</xref>], suggesting that crizotinib exhibits anti-tumor activity through the generation of ROS.</p>
<p>In the present study, we attempted to clarify the mechanisms by which crizotinib exhibits its anti-tumor activity by investigating its effects on the proliferation and tumor formation by NPM-ALK. Interestingly, we found that α-tocopherol attenuated the anti-tumor activity of crizotinib independently of its anti-oxidant properties by performing <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis. Our results not only clarified some of the mechanisms by which crizotinib exerts its anti-tumor effects, but also suggest that the intake of vitamin E attenuates the anti-tumor effects of crizotinib.</p>

For preparation of cytosolic fraction and nuclear fraction, cells were disrupted in Buffer A (10 mM Hepes-KOH (pH7.8), 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA (pH8.0), 0.1% NP-40) and were centrifuged at 5,000 r.p.m for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected and used as cytosolic fraction. Isolated nuclei were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and homogenized using the ultrasonic homogenizer VP-50 (TAITEC, Japan), and then centrifuged at 15,000 r.p.m at 4°C for 15 min in order to remove debris. Cytosolic fraction and nuclear fraction were denatured with Laemmli's sample buffer. Denatured proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Membranes were probed using the designated antibodies and visualized with the ECL detection system (GE Healthcare UK., Ltd.). The intensity of each band was quantified by Image-J software. The phosphorylation levels of STAT3 and STAT5 were normalized with the expression levels of STAT3 and STAT5.

Chromatographic separations were performed on Agilent ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C18 column (4.6 × 100 mm, 3.5 μm) at a flow rate 0.5 mL/min. The mobile phases used were water with 0.1% formic acid (A) and acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (B). At time zero the flow consisted of 90% of mobile phase A and 10% mobile phase B. One minute after injection, the proportion of B was linearly increased to 100% over 4 min followed by keeping constant at 100%B for 5 min. From this point, the mobile phase was set to initial conditions (90%A and 10%B) and the column was equilibrated for 5 min prior to the next injection. The electrospray ionization probe was set at 350°C, with the nebulizing gas pressure and electrospray gas flow set at 20 psi. and 13 L/min, respectively.

<title>Crizotinib specifically induced apoptosis in Ba/F3 cells transformed by NPM-ALK</title>
<p>Similar to NPM-ALK, the oncogenic tyrosine kinase, TEL-JAK2 is generated from reciprocal chromosomal translocations and causes lymphoma and leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref019">19</xref>]. In order to examine the specificity of the drug efficacy of crizotinib against tumor-related tyrosine kinases, murine hematopoietic Ba/F3 cells were infected with an empty retrovirus (-) and retroviruses harboring NPM-ALK and TEL-JAK2, respectively. NPM-ALK induced the phosphorylation of STAT3, whereas TEL-JAK2 induced the phosphorylation of STAT5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). NPM-ALK and TEL-JAK2 both induced the cytokine-independent proliferation of Ba/F3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). We then investigated the effects of the ALK inhibitor, crizotinib on the viability of Ba/F3 cells transformed by NPM-ALK and TEL-JAK2. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, crizotinib specifically decreased the viability of Ba/F3 cells expressing NPM-ALK in a dose-dependent manner, while Ba/F3 cells expressing TEL-JAK2 appeared to exhibit resistance against the treatment with crizotinib. On the other hand, mitomycin C (MMC), a DNA crosslinking anti-cancer drug, significantly decreased the viabilities of Ba/F3 cells expressing NPM-ALK and TEL-JAK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, right). The treatment of Ba/F3 cells expressing NPM-ALK with crizotinib resulted in the accumulation of cells in the sub-G1 phase, which is well established as a characteristic of apoptotic cell death; however, this was not observed in cells expressing TEL-JAK2. In contrast, MMC significantly increased the percentages of both cells in the sub-G1 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). To confirm that crizotinib induces the apoptotic cell death, we investigated whether internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, a biochemical characteristic of apoptosis, could be detected in the crizotinib-treated cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g001">Fig 1E</xref>, the treatment with crizotinib clearly induced the ladder pattern of DNA internucleosomal fragmentation in Ba/F3 cells expressing NPM-ALK but not Ba/F3 cells expressing TEL-JAK2. On the other hand, MMC induced DNA internucleosomal fragmentation in both cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). The treatment with crizotinib inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner in Ba/F3 cells expressing NPM-ALK, but had no effect on STAT5 phosphorylation in Ba/F3 cells expressing TEL-JAK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g001">Fig 1F</xref>).

<title>α-Tocopherol rescued crizotinib-induced apoptosis in cells transformed by NPM-ALK in a ROS-independent manner</title>
<p>A previous study reported that crizotinib increases intracellular ROS levels in human alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref013">13</xref>]. Therefore, we evaluated the generation of intracellular ROS by measuring oxidized DCFH-DA (2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein-DA), and tested whether crizotinib induces apoptosis in Ba/F3 cells expressing NPM-ALK through the generation of ROS. In a previous study, pyrrolidinium fullerene caused apoptotic cell death via the generation of ROS in HL60 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref014">14</xref>]; therefore, we utilized it as a positive control for ROS generation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, while the treatment with pyrrolidinium fullerene drastically enhanced the generation of ROS in Ba/F3 cells expressing NPM-ALK, the treatment with crizotinib slightly enhanced the generation of ROS. In addition, the co-treatment with two kinds of anti-oxidants, α-tocopherol and edaravone significantly suppressed pyrrolidinium fullerene and crizotinib-induced ROS generation in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). We then investigated the effects of these anti-oxidants on the viability of Ba/F3 cells expressing NPM-ALK, which were treated with crizotinib or pyrrolidinium fullerene. Similar to the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g001">Fig 1</xref>, crizotinib markedly reduced the viability of Ba/F3 cells expressing NPM-ALK; however, α-tocopherol, but not edaravone significantly recovered the viability of crizotinib-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). On the other hand, the pyrrolidinium fullerene-induced reduction in cell viability appeared to be canceled by the co-treatment with α-tocopherol and edaravone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). These results clearly suggest that crizotinib-induced cell death and its cancelation by α-tocopherol were the most unlikely to depend on intracellular ROS levels. We subsequently examined the effects of anti-oxidants on the crizotinib and pyrrolidinium fullerene-induced accumulation of sub-G1 phase cells in Ba/F3 cells expressing NPM-ALK. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>, α-tocopherol, but not edaravone consistently reduced increases in the accumulation of sub-G1 phase in Ba/F3 cells expressing NPM-ALK induced by crizotinib. On the other hand, the pyrrolidinium fullerene-induced accumulation of sub-G1 phase cells was reduced by the treatment with α-tocopherol and edaravone. In addition, the crizotinib-induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was prevented by the co-treatment with α-tocopherol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g002">Fig 2G</xref>). Collectively, these results strongly suggest that ROS are not critical for crizotinib-induced apoptosis in cells expressing NPM-ALK. They also indicate that α-tocopherol rescued crizotinib-induced apoptosis in cells transformed by NPM-ALK regardless of its ability to scavenge ROS.</p>

<title>α-Tocopherol specifically rescued crizotinib-induced apoptotic cell death in cells transformed by NPM-ALK</title>
<p>Vitamin E is an antioxidant that includes two groups of fat-soluble benzopyranol compounds: tocopherols and tocotrienols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref020">20</xref>]. Based on their chemical structures, tocopherols are a series of related benzopyranols with a C16-saturated side chain, while tocotrienols contain three double bonds on the C16 side chain. Each group contains four constituents termed α (5,7,8-trimethyl), β (5,8-dimethyl), γ (7,8-dimethyl), and δ (8-methyl) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). We investigated whether other vitamin E-related compounds such as other tocopherols, α-tocotrienol, and trolox exert inhibitory effects on crizotinib-induced cell death in cells transformed by NPM-ALK similar to α-tocopherol. However, β-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol, δ-tocopherol, α-tocotrienol, and trolox failed to inhibit crizotinib-induced cytotoxicity in Ba/F3 cells expressing NPM-ALK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).

<title>α-Tocopherol indirectly attenuated the inhibition of NPM-ALK phosphorylation by crizotinib</title>
<p>In order to elucidate the mechanisms by which α-tocopherol specifically attenuates the effects of crizotinib, we examined whether the uptake of crizotinib into Ba/F3 cells expressing NPM-ALK was affected by α-tocopherol. After the treatment with crizotinib in the absence and presence of α-tocopherol, the intracellular concentration of crizotinib was measured by LC-MS. However, similar amounts of crizotinib were taken up by cells regardless of the co-treatment with α-tocopherol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). We then investigated whether α-tocopherol attenuated crizotinib-induced inhibitory effects on kinase activity by NPM-ALK. Cells expressing NPM-ALK were treated with crizotinib in the presence or absence of α-tocopherol, and NPM-ALK was then immunoprecipitated with the anti-Flag antibody in order to evaluate its kinase activity using an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay with radioactive ATP. The autophosphorylation of NPM-ALK was completely suppressed by crizotinib, and this crizotinib-induced inhibition was canceled by the co-treatment with α-tocopherol in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Furthermore, the treatment with α-tocopherol markedly attenuated the crizotinib-induced inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g004">Fig 4C</xref>).

<title>α-Tocopherol significantly attenuated the anti-tumor activity of crizotinib in nude mice transplanted with cells expressing NPM-ALK</title>
<p>In order to evaluate the anti-tumor effects of crizotinib and its cancellation by α-tocopherol, we attempted to establish an assay system by subcutaneously (s.c.) inoculating transduced Ba/F3 cells expressing NPM-ALK into nude mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, whereas Ba/F3 cells expressing NPM-ALK exhibited significant tumor-forming activity, tumor formation was not observed in nude mice inoculated with Ba/F3 cells expressing NPM-ALK (K210R). In these nude mice, abnormally enlarged livers and lymph nodes were observed when mice were transplanted with Ba/F3 cells expressing NPM-ALK, but not NPM-ALK (K210R), suggesting that the kinase activity of NPM-ALK is required for tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). We then tested the <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of crizotinib and α-tocopherol on NPM-ALK-induced tumorigenesis. Nude mice were orally administered crizotinib (1 mg/mouse) and α-tocopherol (4 mg/mouse) for 7 consecutive days after the transplantation of Ba/F3 cells expressing NPM-ALK. The dosages of crizotinib and α-tocopherol for the treatment of mice were established by correlative calculations according to the effective dose in human patients with NSCLC and tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for adults aged 19 years and older [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref026">26</xref>]. In contrast to mice treated with vehicle, tumor formation and enlargements in the liver and lymph nodes were effectively suppressed by the administration of crizotinib. On the other hand, the simultaneous administration of crizotinib and α-tocopherol significantly attenuated the inhibitory effects of crizotinib on tumor formation and enlargements in the liver and lymph nodes in mice receiving Ba/F3 cells expressing NPM-ALK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). In addition, liver sections were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The density of cells was significantly greater, and the arrangement of hepatocytes was disrupted more in the livers of mice inoculated with Ba/F3 cells expressing NPM-ALK than in the livers of mice inoculated with control Ba/F3 cells and Ba/F3 cells expressing the kinase dead mutant of NPM-ALK (K210R) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g006">Fig 6C</xref>), suggesting that these differences were due to the infiltration of NPM-ALK-induced tumor cells. We then attempted to investigate the effects of crizotinib and α-tocopherol on these abnormalities in the livers of mice transplanted with Ba/F3 expressing NPM-ALK. The density of cells and disarrangement of hepatocytes were significantly less with the treatment with crizotinib than with the vehicle. However, in the livers of mice simultaneously administered α-tocopherol, abnormalities such as the enhanced density and disarrangement of hepatocytes were similar to those in the livers of mice treated with vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Taken together, our results strongly support crizotinib being useful for the treatment of NPM-ALK-related tumors; however, its therapeutic effects will be abrogated by a co-treatment with α-tocopherol.</p>

<title>α-Tocopherol significantly attenuated the effect of crizotinib on NPM-ALK-positive cells derived from human ALCL patients</title>
<p>Ki-JK and SUDHL-1 cell lines were derived from ALCL patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref028">28</xref>], which have a t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation producing NPM-ALK. We examined whether α-tocopherol suppresses the inhibitory effects of crizotinib on the proliferation of Ki-JK cells and SUDHL-1 cells. These cell lines were treated with crizotinib in the presence and absence of α-tocopherol, and intracellular ROS levels, cell viability, and the percentages of cells in the sub-G1 phase were then evaluated. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g007">Fig 7A</xref>, the amounts of intracellular ROS were slightly reduced when these two cell lines were treated with a high dose of α-tocopherol. On the other hand, the treatment with crizotinib reduced intracellular ROS levels slightly in Ki-JK cells and markedly in SUDHL-1 cells; however, α-tocopherol did not have any effects on crizotinib-induced reductions in ROS levels in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Although crizotinib markedly decreased the viabilities of Ki-JK cells and SUDHL-1 cells, α-tocopherol significantly rescued these cells from crizotinib-induced cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). In addition, crizotinib significantly induced the accumulation of sub-G1 phase cells in these cell lines; however, this effect was canceled by the treatment with α-tocopherol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). Although crizotinib inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3, the treatment with α-tocopherol markedly attenuated the crizotinib-induced inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation in both Ki-JK cells and SUDHL-1 cells. Furthermore, crizotinib induced the activation of caspase 3, the treatment with α-tocopherol markedly attenuated the crizotinib-induced activation of caspase 3 in both Ki-JK cells and SUDHL-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g007">Fig 7D</xref>), suggesting that crizotinib-induced apoptosis was canceled by the treatment with α-tocopherol. These results demonstrate that the anti-tumor activity of crizotinib against NPM-ALK is also canceled by α-tocopherol in cells derived from human patients with ALCL.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of the present study strongly support the usefulness of crizotinib in the treatment of NPM-ALK-related tumors. Crizotinib is an orally available ALK inhibitor that inhibits ALK by competitively binding within the ATP-binding pocket, and also inhibits receptor tyrosine kinases including c-Met and ROS1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref010">10</xref>]. We demonstrated that the simultaneous administration of α-tocopherol markedly inhibited the therapeutic efficacy of crizotinib; however, we were unable to elucidate the precise mechanism by which α-tocopherol abrogates the inhibitory effects of crizotinib on NPM-ALK.</p>
<p>In the present study, we demonstrated that other anti-oxidants including edaravone, β-tocopherol, δ-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol, α-tocotrienol, and Trolox failed to cancel the effects of crizotinib (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g003">3</xref>), suggesting that α-tocopherol inhibits the anti-tumor effects of crizotinib in a ROS level-independent manner. It has been shown that α-tocopherol negatively regulates the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and aggregation of platelets by inhibiting PKC independently of its antioxidant properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref029">29</xref>]. Previous findings demonstrated that the α-tocopherol-induced inhibition of PKC was suppressed by a co-treatment with β-tocopherol when administered at a similar concentration to that of α-tocopherol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref030">30</xref>]. We examined the effects of a co-treatment with α-tocopherol and β-tocopherol on cytotoxicity induced by crizotinib in Ba/F3 cells expressing NPM-ALK. The results obtained revealed that β-tocopherol failed to buffer the inhibitory effects of α-tocopherol on crizotinib-induced cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183003.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). A previous study reported that α-tocopherol specifically binds to the α-tocopherol transfer protein (TTP) and is involved in the intracellular trafficking of α-tocopherol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref031">31</xref>]. α-Tocopherol has also been reported to activate p38 MAP kinase and its downstream transcription factor, MITF in order to positively regulate the function of osteoclasts in bone tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref032">32</xref>]. In an attempt to clarify the functional involvement of p38 and TTP in the effects of α-tocopherol, we utilized the p38 inhibitor, SB203580, and siRNA against TTP. Although the treatment with SB203580 reduced the viability of Ba/F3 cells expressing NPM-ALK, the α-tocopherol-induced cancelation of cytotoxicity induced by crizotinib was not affected by SB203580 or the knockdown of TTP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183003.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), suggesting that p38 and TTP are not involved in the inhibitory effects of α-tocopherol on crizotinib-induced cytotoxicity.</p>
<p>Interestingly, higher levels of α-tocopherol were needed for rescuing STAT3 phosphorylation in human ALCL cell lines compared to Ba/F3 cells expressing NPM-ALK (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g004">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g007">7D</xref>). Although IC<sub>50</sub> of crizotinib against c-Met and ROS is higher than against ALK, crizotinib inhibits not only ALK, but also c-Met and ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref010">10</xref>]. Therefore, it is suggested that other tyrosine kinases which induces phosphorylation of STAT3 could be involved in the oncogenicity of ALCL-derived cell lines. Indeed, it was reported that the phosphorylation of STAT3 was not completely inhibited by the knockdown of NPM-ALK using siRNA in SUDHL-1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref033">33</xref>]. Although speculative, the involvement of other tyrosine kinases such as c-Met and ROS might be a reason for the requirement of high dosage of α-tocopherol for rescuing STAT3 phosphorylation in SULH-1 cells and Ki-JK cells. Furthermore, whereas crizotinib slightly induced ROS generation in Ba/F3 cells, intracellular ROS levels was decreased by the treatment with crizotinib in human ALCL cell lines (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g002">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g007">7A</xref>). Since it was reported that c-Met harbors the ability to control the ROS generation and contributes in the oncogenicity of ALCL-derived cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref035">35</xref>], it is also suggested that the involvement of c-Met could be a reason for the different responses against the treatment of crizotinib in between ALCL-derived cell lines and Ba/F3 cells.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183003.g005">Fig 5</xref>, NPM-ALK was localized in the cytosol and the nucleus as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref022">22</xref>]. Remarkably, the nuclear localization of NPM-ALK required its kinase activity, and crizotinib effectively suppressed the nuclear localization of NPM-ALK. Wild type NPM is mainly localized in nucleoli, however some population shuttled between nucleolus, nucleoplasm, and cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref023">23</xref>]. Since NPM forms mono-oligomer, it is not surprising that NPM-ALK could interact with NPM. The localization of NPM-ALK is most likely regulated by fused-NPM region and interacted endogenous NPM, therefore partial population of NPM-ALK was detected in nucleolus. Several groups reported that the nucleolar localization of NPM-ALK was not required for the cellular transformation provoked by NPM-ALK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref021">21</xref>]. N-terminal NPM of NPM-ALK could be replaced with the portion of the unrelated translocated promoter region (TPR) protein that activates the TPR-MET fusion kinase by mediating dimerization through its leucine zipper motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref005">5</xref>]. Whereas NPM-ALK was localized in nucleolus, nucleoplasm, and cytoplasm, the artificial fusion protein TPR-ALK was detectable in only cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref021">21</xref>]. In spite of its different localization, TPR-ALK exhibited the comparable transforming activity with NPM-ALK. However, their reports failed to contradict the possibility that undetectable small population of TPR-ALK could be localized in nucleus, and contribute to the cellular transformation. N-terminal NPM region of NPM-ALK contains nuclear export sequence (NES), however lacks nuclear localization sequence (NLS), suggesting that nuclear localization of NPM-ALK should be triggered by interacting protein of NPM-ALK. Although we do not have any direct evidences supporting the possible contribution of nuclear NPM-ALK in Ba/F3 cells to cellular transformation, it will be important to identify the interacting proteins with nuclear NPM-ALK to elucidate the mechanism how NPM-ALK induces the cellular transformation. In addition, the mutation analysis of NES of NPM-ALK will be the clue for the investigation for the function of nuclear NPM-ALK.</p>
<p>Clinical resistance mutations of EML4-ALK to crizotinib including L1196M, C1156Y, G1269A, L1152R, G1202R, F1174C, I1171T, and S1206Y have been reported in patients with NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref036">36</xref>]. Although we have no direct evidence, the treatment with α-tocopherol may have caused structural alterations in NPM-ALK, similar to the NPM-ALK mutants exhibiting resistance to crizotinib. Second generation ALK inhibitors such as alectinib have recently been developed to overcome acquired resistance to crizotinib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref037">37</xref>]. We found that α-tocopherol failed to attenuate cytotoxicity by alectinib against Ba/F3 cells expressing NPM-ALK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183003.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). In addition, although we investigated the effects of α-tocopherol on the JAK2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib-induced apoptosis in Ba/F3 cells transformed by a constitutive active mutant of JAK2 (V617F), α-tocopherol failed to rescue ruxolitinib-induced apoptosis in these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183003.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Therefore, these results suggest that the inhibitory effects of α-tocopherol on crizotinib depend on its chemical structure.</p>
<p>However, it remains unclear whether the α-tocopherol-mediated inactivation of crizotinib occurs enzymatically or is mediated by non-enzymatic steps.</p>
<p>Vitamin E, which is composed of tocopherols and tocotrienols, is one of the most popular supplements in the world; more than 10% of adults take at least 400 IU of vitamin E daily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183003.ref038">38</xref>]. α-Tocopherol is the major component of vitamin E and is preferentially absorbed by and accumulates in the human body. Although a number of issues have yet to be clarified, our results indicate that the anti-tumor activities of well-known compounds may be abrogated by environmental factors, such as the intake of supplements, in patients with tumor-related diseases.</p>
