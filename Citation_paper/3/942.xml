          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Within the GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor field, two important questions are what molecular mechanisms underlie benzodiazepine tolerance, and whether tolerance can be ascribed to certain GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor subtypes.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>We investigated tolerance to acute anxiolytic, hypothermic and sedative effects of diazepam in mice exposed for 28-days to non-selective/selective GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor positive allosteric modulators: diazepam (non-selective), bretazenil (partial non-selective), zolpidem (α<sub>1</sub> selective) and TPA023 (α<sub>2/3</sub> selective). In-vivo binding studies with [<sup>3</sup>H]flumazenil confirmed compounds occupied CNS GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Chronic diazepam treatment resulted in tolerance to diazepam's acute anxiolytic, hypothermic and sedative effects. In mice treated chronically with bretazenil, tolerance to diazepam's anxiolytic and hypothermic, but not sedative, effects was seen. Chronic zolpidem treatment resulted in tolerance to diazepam's hypothermic effect, but partial anxiolytic tolerance and no sedative tolerance. Chronic TPA023 treatment did not result in tolerance to diazepam's hypothermic, anxiolytic or sedative effects.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>Our data indicate that: (i) GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>2</sub>/α<sub>3</sub> subtype selective drugs might not induce tolerance; (ii) in rodents quantitative and temporal variations in tolerance development occur dependent on the endpoint assessed, consistent with clinical experience with benzodiazepines (e.g., differential tolerance to antiepileptic and anxiolytic actions); (iii) tolerance to diazepam's sedative actions needs concomitant activation of GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>1</sub>/GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>5</sub> receptors. Regarding mechanism, in-situ hybridization studies indicated no gross changes in expression levels of GABA<sub>A</sub> α<sub>1</sub>, α<sub>2</sub> or α<sub>5</sub> subunit mRNA in hippocampus or cortex. Since selective chronic activation of either GABA<sub>A</sub> α<sub>2</sub>, or α<sub>3</sub> receptors does not engender tolerance development, subtype-selective GABA<sub>A</sub> drugs might constitute a promising class of novel drugs.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Classical benzodiazepines allosterically enhance the inhibitory actions of GABA by binding to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors that contain α<sub>1</sub>, α<sub>2</sub>, α<sub>3</sub> or α<sub>5</sub> subunits in combination with a β and a γ<sub>2</sub> subunit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Sieghart1">[1]</xref>. Despite widespread clinical utility, benzodiazepines are associated with tolerance development to some therapeutic effects over time. There is insufficient knowledge about the mechanisms involved in tolerance development to benzodiazepines nor why tolerance develops at different rates depending on the endpoint (sedation, anxiolytic, amnesic, anti-epileptic) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Bateson1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Vinkers1">[3]</xref>. From a therapeutic perspective, this understanding is desirable as benzodiazepines are highly effective drugs which, if they could be prescribed for longer-term use, would offer major benefits to patients. In addition, tolerance mechanisms are also likely to be important in our understanding as to why a smaller group of patients escalate and abuse benzodiazepines. Although poorly understood, tolerance development has been ascribed to adaptation at the level of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, either as a consequence of changes in receptor expression or due to reduced allosteric coupling between GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites (see review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Bateson1">[2]</xref>. However, putative changes in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunit mRNA levels in response to chronic treatment are variable and suggested to be both treatment- and region-specific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Wafford1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-UusiOukari1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Increased understanding that distinct GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subtypes mediate different effects of benzodiazepines has led to a new generation of α subunit-selective ligands, some of which have been tested in man <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Rudolph1">[6]</xref>. Elegant genetic studies introduced single point mutations into specific α-subunits of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (α<sub>1</sub>(H101R), α<sub>2</sub>(H101R), α<sub>3</sub>(H126R) and α<sub>5</sub>(H105R)), making subunits insensitive to benzodiazepines without affecting GABA sensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Rudolph2">[7]</xref>. The pharmacological approach has resulted in novel compounds which, whilst binding with equal affinity to all GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor α subunits (α<sub>1</sub>, α<sub>2</sub>, α<sub>3</sub> or α<sub>5</sub>), engender differential activation (intrinsic efficacy) of one or more of these receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Rudolph1">[6]</xref>. The availability of such subtype-selective tools allows one to test whether tolerance is mediated by the same GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subtype that are involved in the acute effect, or whether (i) specific α subunit receptors are involved in the development of tolerance, or (ii) a more complex interaction between α subunit receptors accounts for tolerance. However, despite the increased availability of subtype-selective pharmacological tools, understanding tolerance development to the different effects of benzodiazepines has received scant attention. One study has shown using α point-mutated mice that GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>5</sub> receptors are important in the development of tolerance to the sedative effects of diazepam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-vanRijnsoever1">[8]</xref>. Further, no analgesic tolerance was shown to the prototype α<sub>2/3/5</sub> subtype-selective compound L838,417 (relative to morphine) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Knabl1">[9]</xref> nor to the purported α<sub>2/3</sub> selective ligand HZ166 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-DiLio1">[10]</xref> in a chronic constriction injury model of neuropathic pain.</p>
      <p>Here, we compare tolerance to various acute effects of diazepam in rodents during chronic (28-day) treatment with the non-selective GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) diazepam (a full efficacy PAM) and bretazenil (a weak efficacy PAM), with the subtype selective GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>1</sub> affinity selective sedative-hypnotic PAM zolpidem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Sanger1">[11]</xref>, and the GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>2/3</sub> functionally selective PAM TPA023 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Atack1">[12]</xref>. Tolerance development to the anxiolytic and hypothermic effects of diazepam in these different treatment groups was assessed at 7-day intervals using the stress-induced hyperthermia (SIH) paradigm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Vinkers2">[13]</xref>. The SIH response is the transient rise in body temperature in response to a stressor that is mediated by the autonomic nervous system. The SIH response can be reduced using clinically effective anxiolytics including (subtype-selective) GABAergic compounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Vinkers3">[14]</xref>. The SIH model was selected rather than another anxiolytic model, since the SIH response remains intact upon repeat testing at one week intervals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-VanderHeyden1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Bouwknecht1">[16]</xref>, whereas repeated exposure results in habituation in the light-dark box and the elevated plus maze <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Holmes1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Rodgers1">[18]</xref>. The primary aim of this study was to disentangle the role of different GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subtypes in tolerance development to the benzodiazepine diazepam, as well as to ascertain whether any molecular alterations after chronic treatment might account for tolerance development.</p>

        <p>Male 129Sv/EvTac mice (Taconic, Denmark, 10–12 weeks old) were group-housed at constant temperature (21±2°C) and humidity (50%–60%) with PVC tubing as cage enrichment. Standard food pellets (Special Diet Services, Witham, Essex, United Kingdom) and water were freely available. Mice were maintained on a 12-hour light–dark cycle (lights on at 6 AM). One week after arrival, osmotic minipumps were implanted. After recovery from surgery, mice were group-housed. All experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal research at Utrecht University (2008.06.049) and in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki. All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering.</p>

        <p>Diazepam (base) and zolpidem (tartaric acid) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. TPA023 (7-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-6-(2-ethyl-2H-1,2,4-triazol-3-ylmethoxy)-3-(2-fluorophenyl)-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazine) was synthesized according to published methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Carling1">[19]</xref>. Bretazenil was provided by Neurosearch A/S. An injection volume of 10 ml/kg was used for drug injections. A fresh diazepam suspension in gelatin-mannitol 0.5%/5% was prepared daily. A chronic vehicle control group was included in all experiments to control for the influence of repeat testing and to ascertain whether acutely administered diazepam itself led to tolerance. In the following methodological descriptions described below (post-surgery), we assessed the influence of chronic treatment with the GABAergic drugs described above on: (i) tolerance to diazepam's acute effects on SIH, hypothermia and locomotor activity (open field); and (ii) expression levels of various GABA<sub>A</sub> α subunits using in-situ hybridisation.

Ten minutes later, mice were killed by decapitation, brains were rapidly removed and forebrains homogenized in 12 ml of ice-cold Tris citrate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.1) using a Ultra-Turrax homogenizer. Three separate aliquots of 1 ml were filtered through Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters and washed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold buffer. Nonspecific binding was determined by animal groups administered 3.0 mg/kg i.p. clonazepam 20 min before [<sup>3</sup>H]flumazenil injection. Radioactivity on the filters was determined by conventional liquid scintillation counting using a Tri-Carb™ counter (PerkinElmer).

          <p>The SIH procedure was carried out according to methodology published previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Groenink1">[24]</xref>. SIH is quantified in singly housed mice using rectal temperature assessment as the stressor. Rectal temperature is measured twice 10-min apart, with the first measurement serving as the stressor and the second as a measure of the stress response. Due to the stress experienced during the first temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub>) measurement, the temperature of the second measurement (<italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub>) is approximately 1–2°C higher than that of the first (<italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub>). This difference in temperature (Δ<italic>T</italic> = <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub>−<italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub>) is defined as the SIH response. In determining diazepam's influence on the SIH response in the different chronic treatment groups outlined in Experiments 1 and 2 described above, either vehicle or diazepam (5 mg/kg, IP) was injected 60 min before the first temperature measurement (T<sub>1</sub>).

In Experiment 1, mice that had been tested weekly with acute diazepam were tested for tolerance to diazepam's hypolocomotor effect at the end of the 28-day treatment period using a within-subject design. In Experiment 2, all mice were tested in the open field using a between-subject design. In both experiments, diazepam (5 mg/kg, IP) or vehicle was administered 60 min prior to testing in the open field. Each animal was placed in the dimly lit center (5 lux) and allowed to explore for 5 min.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the present study, we investigated whether differential tolerance develops to the anxiolytic-like, hypothermic and sedative effects of acute diazepam administration in mice treated chronically for 28 days with various GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor PAMs with different affinity and/or functional selectivity for GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subtypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Rudolph1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Atack3">[30]</xref>. Tolerance development appears to have different quantitative and temporal dynamics dependent on the endpoint assessed (<italic>e.g.</italic>, anxiety, hypothermia or hypolocomotion) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Vinkers1">[3]</xref>. This is broadly in line with the clinical situation where differential tolerance to the effects of benzodiazepines exists dependent upon the clinical endpoint. Probably, these different "tolerance profiles" in rodents or in humans are a consequence of multiple factors including dose, exposure, receptor occupancy, half-life, metabolic and pharmacokinetic profiles, in addition to affinity, efficacy and subtype selectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Mirza1">[27]</xref>. One clinical implication of our data is that GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>2</sub>/α<sub>3</sub> subtype selective ligands such as TPA023 are unlikely to lead to anxiolytic tolerance. However, to date there is still no firm evidence that GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>2</sub>/α<sub>3</sub> subtype selective compounds are anxiolytic in man <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Atack3">[30]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In two separate studies, we demonstrated that during chronic 28-day treatment with the classical non-selective benzodiazepine diazepam (10 or 15 mg/kg), there was tolerance to acute diazepam's anxiolytic and hypothermic effects. Interestingly, in the first experiment where diazepam was administered via osmotic minipumps at a dose of 10 mg/kg there was partial and slowly developing anxiolytic tolerance (by day 21), whereas there was relatively robust and rapid hypothermic tolerance (by day 7–14) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043054.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043054.s002">Table S1</xref>). By contrast, in the follow up experiment where a higher dose (15 mg/kg) of diazepam was administered for 28 days, a more robust anxiolytic tolerance was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043054-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The rate of tolerance development to the anxiolytic and hypothermic effects after acute diazepam administration were comparable across both experiments. Clearly, the dose level of diazepam has a greater impact on the rate and level of anxiolytic tolerance development compared to hypothermic tolerance. Extrapolation of this mouse dose to a human equivalent is performed through normalization to body surface area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-ReaganShaw1">[31]</xref>. This way, an acute diazepam dose of 5 mg/kg in mice corresponds to an equivalent human dose of 0.40 mg/kg.</p>
      <p>To understand whether tolerance to effects of diazepam described above could be ascribed to specific subtypes of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, we ran additional studies by assessing acute diazepam challenges in animals chronically treated via osmotic mini-pumps with different subtype selective PAMs. However, since some recently described PAMs with functional selectivity for subtypes of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are not full efficacy PAMs (<italic>i.e.</italic>, partial agonists) at receptors for which they possess functional selectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Mirza2">[32]</xref>, we tested the non-selective low efficacy PAM bretazenil to ensure low efficacy per se did not have an impact on diazepam-induced tolerance independent of selectivity. In animals chronically treated with the low-efficacy PAM bretazenil, tolerance to diazepam's anxiolytic and hypothermic effects was broadly consistent with tolerance in chronic diazepam treated mice. However, the magnitude of anxiolytic tolerance was somewhat lower in chronic bretazenil-treated mice than chronic diazepam-treated mice, consistent with a lower propensity to tolerance development with weak PAMs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Haefely1">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p>After chronic treatment with the α<sub>1</sub>-selective drug zolpidem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Sanger1">[11]</xref>, tolerance also developed to diazepam's acute anxiolytic and hypothermic effects. However, whereas the rate and level of tolerance development to diazepam-induced <italic>hypothermia</italic> was equivalent in chronic diazepam and zolpidem treated mice, the level and rate of <italic>anxiolytic</italic> tolerance were reduced in chronic zolpidem-treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043054-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Since, (i) the anxiolytic effect of benzodiazepines such as diazepam are thought to be mediated via GABA<sub>A</sub>- α<sub>2</sub> and/or α<sub>3</sub> receptors, and (ii) zolpidem has 10–15 fold affinity selectivity for GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>1</sub> over GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>2</sub>/α<sub>3</sub> receptors, and no affinity for GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>5</sub> receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Sieghart2">[33]</xref>, the partial anxiolytic tolerance to acute diazepam challenge in chronic zolpidem treated mice might imply: (a) that activation of GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>2</sub>/α<sub>3</sub> receptors does not lead to anxiolytic tolerance, or (b) that, given zolpidem's affinity selectivity profile, there was insufficient occupancy and activation of GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>2</sub>/α<sub>3</sub> receptors at the dose of zolpidem used to demonstrate anxiolytic tolerance to acute diazepam challenge. Our data with the α<sub>2/3</sub> selective PAM TPA023 described below indicates that the former is more likely to be the case.</p>
      <p>Conversely, since zolpidem has a &gt;1000-fold affinity selectivity for GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>1</sub> over GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>5</sub> receptors, it would appear that the equivalent rate and level of hypothermic tolerance to acute diazepam challenge in chronic zolpidem and diazepam treated mice indicates that hypothermia is probably mediated through GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>1</sub> receptors and that there is rapid tolerance to this effect. These conclusions are consistent with our previous finding that the hypothermic response to zolpidem and diazepam in mice is antagonized by the GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>1</sub> selective antagonist β-CCT, whereas this same antagonist does not affect the SIH reducing effect of these two ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Vinkers3">[14]</xref>. However, a role for GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>2</sub>/α<sub>3</sub> receptors in mediating hypothermic tolerance to acute diazepam challenge cannot be fully excluded since zolpidem is only 10–15 fold affinity selective for GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>1</sub> over GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>2</sub>/α<sub>3</sub> receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Sieghart1">[1]</xref>, and at the dose used here this might be sufficient to activate these receptor subtypes in-vivo. Also, we cannot fully exclude the possibility that the presence of alcohol in pumps may have potentially confounded our data, even though the amounts are well marginal compared to the acute doses of 2–4 g/kg that are needed to affect body temperature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Vinkers4">[34]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In contrast to anxiolytic tolerance to acute diazepam in chronic diazepam and, partly, in zolpidem treated mice, no anxiolytic tolerance developed to acute diazepam challenge in mice treated chronically with TPA023. Since TPA023 is functionally selective for GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>2</sub>/α<sub>3</sub> receptors which mediate benzodiazepine-induced anxiolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Atack1">[12]</xref>, this data would appear to more directly support the contention that chronic activation of GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>2</sub>/α<sub>3</sub> receptors does not lead to anxiolytic tolerance to acute diazepam challenge. This conclusion would also concur with the fact that TPA023 does not activate GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>1</sub>/α<sub>5</sub> receptors despite high affinity binding to these receptor subtypes, and is consistent with the zolpidem data discussed above. Although a different endpoint, recent data have indicated no analgesic tolerance to the prototype α<sub>2/3/5</sub> subtype-selective compound L838,417 (relative to morphine) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Knabl1">[9]</xref> and the purported α<sub>2/3</sub> subtype-selective ligand HZ166 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-DiLio1">[10]</xref> in a chronic constriction injury model of neuropathic pain.</p>
      <p>Clinically, benzodiazepine tolerance to the anxiolytic effects of diazepam develops slowly or not at all <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Vinkers5">[35]</xref>, and our data suggest that chronic treatment with compounds selective for GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>2</sub>/α<sub>3</sub> receptors would be even less likely to induce tolerance to anxiolytic effects in man. Nonetheless, we would advice some caution in reaching this conclusion for two reasons: (i) it is only based on the autonomic SIH paradigm which may not be readily extrapolated to other anxiety paradigms like the elevated plus maze and the light-dark box. Although, in contrast to these paradigms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Holmes1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Rodgers1">[18]</xref>, a clear advantage of the SIH paradigm is that weekly use does not lead to adaptation of the unconditioned SIH response, and therefore, we were able to follow tolerance development over time without the confounds of repeat testing which are troublesome in other behavioural models of anxiety <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Bouwknecht2">[36]</xref>; (ii) it is not clear what concentration of TPA023 is achieved after a 15 mg/kg dose in-vivo, specifically in the CNS. If the concentrations achieved are in excess of concentrations assessed in electrophysiology at recombinant GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Atack1">[12]</xref>, it is plausible that the <italic>in-vivo</italic> selectivity of the compound could differ from its <italic>in vitro</italic> selectivity profile. Certainly at the dose of TPA023 used (15 mg/kg) we would expect full saturation of central benzodiazepine sites on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors based on our in-vivo [<sup>3</sup>H]flumazenil binding data.</p>
      <p>With respect to the hypothermia endpoint, although in mice treated chronically with TPA023 there appeared to be some hypothermic tolerance, this partial tolerance was also seen in chronic vehicle treated mice that had been challenged with acute diazepam in both experiments, suggesting no specific role for GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>2/</sub>α<sub>3</sub> receptors in hypothermia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043054-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Finally, it is important to note that some degree of hypothermic tolerance, but not anxiolytic tolerance, developed after repeated intermittent diazepam challenge in chronic vehicle treated mice. This is relevant since intermittent treatment in animal studies is likely to be more comparable to intermittent exposure to drug in the clinical context rather than constant delivery of drug via osmotic minipumps. The constant and slow release of diazepam via the osmotic minipump may also explain why chronic diazepam treatment – in contrast to acute diazepam injections via the intraperitoneal route – did not result in any hypothermia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043054-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>
      <p>One additional observation to these main points regarding tolerance to the hypothermic tolerance to acute diazepam challenge, was that on day 1 acute diazepam challenge induced a rather severe hypothermic response in all chronic treatment groups compared to what we have demonstrated previously with this dose of diazepam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Vinkers6">[37]</xref>. It is likely that this severe hypothermic response is the result of a combination of both acute diazepam challenge and limited postsurgical recovery time (studies started one day after surgery). This severe hypothermia likely explains the death of seven animal's postsurgically (see Methods section), especially in the group that received diazepam via osmotic minipumps combined with an acute diazepam challenge on day 1. Although group sizes were still sufficient to allow for valid statistical analyses, in light of this severe hypothermic response to diazepam on day 1 in all groups, it is reasonable expressing some caution in interpreting the SIH results described above since hypothermia would interfere with thermoregulatory homeostatic processes essential to the SIH response. Moreover, since we did not include a no-stress group, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that recovery of diazepam-induced hypothermia itself could lead to an increase in body temperature independent of stress.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, mice chronically treated with diazepam for just over 4 weeks displayed clear tolerance to acute diazepam-induced hypolocomotion. Tolerance to this effect of diazepam was not seen in any other chronic treatment group, including chronic bretazenil-treated mice. The bretazenil data are consistent with prior research indicating a lower propensity to tolerance development with weak PAMs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Haefely1">[23]</xref> (but see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Puia1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Bosman1">[39]</xref>). Since motor deficits such as hypolocomotion and ataxia are mediated via GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>1</sub> receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Rudolph3">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-McKernan1">[41]</xref>, it is at first glance surprising that there is no tolerance to diazepam-induced hypolocomotion in chronic zolpidem treated mice since zolpidem has selectivity for the GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>1</sub> receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Sieghart2">[33]</xref>. However, tolerance to diazepam-induced hypolocomotion appears to depend on concomitant activation of GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>5</sub> receptors in addition to GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>1</sub> receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-vanRijnsoever1">[8]</xref>. These authors showed that sedative tolerance to 8-day diazepam treatment (15 mg/kg, IP) was observed in wildtype and GABA<sub>A</sub>- α<sub>2</sub> and α<sub>3</sub> knock-in mice, but not in GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>5</sub> knock-in mice. In the same study, binding experiments with the GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>5</sub> selective radioligands [<sup>3</sup>H]RY80/[<sup>3</sup>H]L655,708 showed that there was a significant decrease in binding in the dentate gyrus, concomitant with tolerance development, in wildtype and GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>2</sub> knock-in mice, but not GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>1</sub> knock-in mice. These findings are consistent with our findings here that there is no tolerance to diazepam-induced hypolocomotion in chronic zolpidem-treated mice, since zolpidem does not have affinity for the GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>5</sub> receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Sieghart2">[33]</xref>. Also, chronic zolpidem treatment in rodents fails to alter α<sub>5</sub> subunit mRNA levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Holt1">[42]</xref>. TPA023, whilst having high nM affinity for both GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>1</sub> and α<sub>5</sub> receptors does not activate either of these receptor subtypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Atack1">[12]</xref> and therefore cannot engender relevant (unknown) regulatory changes necessary for tolerance to diazepam-induced hypolocomotion.</p>
      <p>Regarding molecular mechanisms underlying some of the physiological and behavioural tolerance data described above, our findings on the effect of chronic treatment with selective and non-selective PAMs on α<sub>1</sub>, α<sub>2</sub> or α<sub>5</sub> subunit mRNA levels in hippocampus and cortex give no obvious answers. Apart from the modest increase in hippocampal α<sub>2</sub> subunit mRNA following chronic diazepam treatment, none of the other chronic drug treatments led to any significant changes in expression levels of α<sub>1</sub>, α<sub>2</sub> or α<sub>5</sub> subunit mRNA in hippocampus or cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043054-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, overall no obvious alteration in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunit levels can account for tolerance development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Vinkers5">[35]</xref>. A recent extensive review yielded inconsistent changes of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunit mRNA and protein levels after chronic benzodiazepine treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-UusiOukari1">[5]</xref>. For example, there are studies that report no changes in α<sub>1</sub> subunit mRNA expression after chronic benzodiazepine treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Fahey1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Fahey2">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-RamseyWilliams1">[45]</xref>, whereas others report decreases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Heninger1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Kang1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Tietz1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Impagnatiello1">[49]</xref>. Similar heterogeneity of results exists in reports on other GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Zhao1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Tietz2">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Pesold1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Wu1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Auta1">[54]</xref>. Putative changes in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunit mRNA levels appear to be both treatment- and region-specific, and may also depend on the method used to quantify mRNA levels. Moreover, the length and method of chronic treatment seems relevant, since differences in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunit mRNA levels after chronic diazepam treatment in rats can depend on whether diazepam is administered as daily systemic injections or via osmotic minipumps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Arnot1">[55]</xref>. In addition to suggestions that tolerance development might reflect reduced allosteric interaction between the benzodiazepine and GABA binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Primus1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Hutchinson1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Ali1">[58]</xref>, future studies on compensatory changes distal to the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor after chronic treatment with GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor PAMs, including second messenger systems (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Huopaniemi1">[59]</xref>) or changes in excitatory amino acid systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Allison1">[60]</xref>, might shed more light on mechanisms underlying tolerance development.</p>
      <p>In summary, our findings are a first step towards addressing the issue of tolerance development to chronic treatment with novel subtype selective GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor PAMs. Broadly, our finding that tolerance development to diazepam in rodents has different quantitative and temporal dynamics dependent on the endpoint assessed is reminiscent of benzodiazepine effects in humans. This gives weight to rodents as a model system to study pharmacology and mechanisms associated with chronic benzodiazepine treatment. More specifically, our data with TPA023, relative to data with the other PAMs studied, leads us to conclude that tolerance development to GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>2</sub>/α<sub>3</sub> subtype selective drugs might not be an issue in man (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Knabl1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-DiLio1">[10]</xref>). One clinical inference that might be drawn from our data is that a patient with an anxiety disorder treated with a GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>2</sub>/α<sub>3</sub> subtype selective drug is still likely to respond to a benzodiazepine, albeit to date there is still no firm evidence that GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>2</sub>/α<sub>3</sub> subtype selective compounds are anxiolytic in man <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Atack3">[30]</xref>. However, our data does not address the converse clinical situation. It remains to be investigated whether a patient would continue to benefit from anxiolytic effects if switched from a classical benzodiazepine to a GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>2</sub>/α<sub>3</sub> subtype selective drug. It is important for future research to investigate whether anxiolytic cross-tolerance to the effect of TPA023 (or other subtype selective compound) is demonstrable in rodents chronically exposed to diazepam. If GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>2</sub>/α<sub>3</sub> subtype selective drugs do not induce tolerance in man, such subtype selective compounds might not engender clinical dependence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Atack1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Mirza3">[61]</xref> or potentially drug abuse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Ator1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-Rowlett1">[63]</xref>. This would constitute a significant clinical improvement over classical benzodiazepines in addition to GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>2</sub>/α<sub>3</sub> selective compounds' reduced propensity to engender sedation and postural instability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043054-deHaas1">[64]</xref>. In conclusion, this first study to systematically address tolerance development to GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>2</sub>/α<sub>3</sub> subtype-selective tools is an important step in improving our understanding of these novel pharmacological agents which might constitute a promising future drug class.</p>
