<abstract>
<p>Large scale surveillance studies, case studies, as well as cohort studies have identified the influence of thyroid hormones on calvarial growth and development. Surveillance data suggests maternal thyroid disorders (hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism with pharmacological replacement, and Maternal Graves Disease) are linked to as much as a 2.5 fold increased risk for craniosynostosis. Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of one or more calvarial growth sites (sutures) prior to the completion of brain expansion. Thyroid hormones maintain proper bone mineral densities by interacting with growth hormone and aiding in the regulation of insulin like growth factors (IGFs). Disruption of this hormonal control of bone physiology may lead to altered bone dynamics thereby increasing the risk for craniosynostosis. In order to elucidate the effect of exogenous thyroxine exposure on cranial suture growth and morphology, wild type C57BL6 mouse litters were exposed to thyroxine <italic>in utero</italic> (control = no treatment; low ~167 ng per day; high ~667 ng per day). Thyroxine exposed mice demonstrated craniofacial dysmorphology (brachycranic). High dose exposed mice showed diminished area of the coronal and widening of the sagittal sutures indicative of premature fusion and compensatory growth. Presence of thyroid receptors was confirmed for the murine cranial suture and markers of proliferation and osteogenesis were increased in sutures from exposed mice. Increased <italic>Htra1</italic> and <italic>Igf1</italic> gene expression were found in sutures from high dose exposed individuals. Pathways related to the HTRA1/IGF axis, specifically Akt and Wnt, demonstrated evidence of increased activity. Overall our data suggest that maternal exogenous thyroxine exposure can drive calvarial growth alterations and altered suture morphology.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Altered craniofacial growth and anomalies often result from a complex combination of genetic susceptibilities, exogenous exposures, and gene/environment interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref008">8</xref>]. Large-scale surveillance studies, case studies, as well as cohort studies have identified thyroid hormones as an important influencing factor in calvarial growth and development; as well as, incidence of craniosynostosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref018">18</xref>]. During normal calvarial development, the sutures are formed between the calvarial bones. As the brain grows the connective tissue surrounding the cranial vault expands outward creating tension resulting in stimulation of the osteogenic sutural membranes to produce bone along the osteogenic fronts on either side of the suture area. This results in the enlargement of each bone while maintaining the undifferentiated suture in between [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref019">19</xref>]. During craniosynostosis one or more of the calvarial growth sites (sutures) fuse obliterating the suture area prior to the completion of brain expansion. The pathogenesis of this disorder is poorly understood but proceeds by bony infiltration within the undifferentiated fibrous tissue of the suture, resulting in synostosis (bony bridging) of the adjacent bones and disruption of normal calvarial expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Clinically, the two most commonly affected cranial sutures are the paired coronal sutures, formed between the two frontal and parietal bones, and the sagittal suture, located between the parietal bones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref020">20</xref>]. Fusion of the coronal suture results in brachycephaly, impediment of anteroposterior growth of the skull creating a wide, short skull; while fusion of the sagittal suture causes scaphocephaly, or the impediment of lateral growth of the skull while anteroposterior growth continues, producing a narrow elongated skull. Disruption of calvarial growth due to exogenous exposures, such as excessive thyroid hormone, can lead to the loss of sutural growth sites resulting in the inability of the skull to accommodate the rapid growth of the brain leading to serious neurological comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Thyroid hormones are important for normal growth and development of the skeleton in addition to their role in the regulation of metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref027">27</xref>]. Proper bone mineral densities are maintained by thyroid hormones interacting with factors such as growth hormone and aiding in the regulation of insulin like growth factors (IGFs). In the long bones, thyroid hormone and its receptors target the reserve and proliferating chondrocytes of the epiphyseal growth plates, influencing mineralization and linear growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref028">28</xref>]. Htra1, a serine peptidase, regulates the expression of <italic>Igf1</italic> which acts as a powerful growth factor affecting linear growth, bone cell differentiation, and bone remodeling. In addition, several downstream pathways important for craniofacial development, including Akt and Wnt, are activated or related to IGF1 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref032">32</xref>]. Thyroid hormones have also been shown to be important for skull bone development and for craniofacial growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref034">34</xref>]. Since thyroid hormones act at all stages of bone development and maintenance, it is not surprising that an overabundance of an osteogenic factor such as thyroid hormone has been linked to abnormal growth and development.</p>
<p>Of particular concern for birth defects research is the incidence of maternal thyrotoxicosis, a transient overabundance of circulating thyroid hormone in pregnant mothers. Thyrotoxicosis is estimated to occur in as great as 3% of all pregnancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref035">35</xref>] and results in an exogenous source of thyroid hormone exposed to the fetus, in addition to that which the fetus is already producing by 12 weeks <italic>in utero</italic>. Surveillance data suggests maternal thyroid disorders (hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism with pharmacological replacement, and Maternal Graves Disease) are linked to as much as a 2.5 fold increased risk for craniosynostosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref036">36</xref>]. At present, the manner in which excess circulating thyroid hormone acts on the developing cranial sutures is not well understood. In this current study, we aim to specifically elucidate the direct effect of <italic>in utero</italic>, exogenous thyroxine exposure on cranial suture growth and morphology in wild type mice. We hypothesize exposure to exogenous thyroid hormone <italic>in utero</italic> will alter craniofacial growth in a dose-dependent manner. Further, we postulate that these induced alterations in growth will involve the downstream Akt and/or Wnt signaling.</p>

<title>Animal Model in vivo Exposure</title>
<p>Adult, wild type, C57BL6 (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) male and female mice were utilized to produce <italic>in utero</italic> thyroxine exposed litters. Animals were bred and separated at ~E13 of pregnancy. At this time, previously described dose ranges of levothyroxine (Synthroid), known to increase T3/T4 exposure without causing amelioration of maternal Thyroid Stimulating Hormone levels, (control dose = no treatment; low dose ~ 167 ng per day; high dose ~ 667 ng per day), were added to the drinking water provided to pregnant dams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref045">45</xref>]. Treatment continued until birth of the litters at ~E20. Mouse pups were grown to 15, 20 and 25 days post-natal (pn) when they were sacrificed via CO<sub>2</sub> overdose with cervical dislocation utilized as a secondary method and whole skulls were collected and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 hours and then switched to 70% Ethanol for micro computed tomography (μCT) analysis. Samples were then further processed for histological investigation. A set of randomly selected skulls were not fixed but were used for RNA (n = 3 control and n = 3 high dose) and protein (n = 3 control and n = 3 high dose) isolation from excised suture tissue. Animal use protocols were approved by Georgia Regents University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (2011–0365), and the Medical University of South Carolina Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (AR#3341). All breeding procedures were carried out in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International accredited facility where all husbandry and related services are provided by the Division of Laboratory Animal Resources. Animals were housed in ventilated racks with automatic water and feeders providing mouse TEKLAD pellets with a 12 hour light-dark cycles. Certified technical personnel and registered veterinary technicians provide daily observation and handling of lab animals. Signs of dehydration and pain as indicated by hunched and lethargic behavior were monitored to assess animal health. All procedures and the reporting thereof are in compliance with the Animal Research: Reporting in Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref046">46</xref>].</p>

<title>Microcomputed Tomography (μCT) Analysis</title>
<p>μCT images were obtained on 15, 20 and 25 day post-natal mouse pup skulls with a SkyScan 1174 (Kontich, Belgium) at a 22.57 μm voxel resolution. Scans were obtained on 181 animals (Male = 42.8%; Female = 43.3%; Undetermined = 13.9%). Mouse skulls were reconstructed with NRecon v1.6.4.8 (BrukermicroCT, Kontich, Belgium) as previously described and imported into Amira v5.0 where it was exposed to a Gaussian Smoothing image filter (r50.3 in X, Y, and Z dimensions; isometric kernel size53) to reduce extraneous noise in the images [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref047">47</xref>]. Threshold settings were then set to only visualize bone volume within the skull. Measurements of the length and width of the cranial vault were collected by a single experienced rater (TEP) from each reconstructed mouse skull. Cranial vault length was defined as the linear distance between landmarks opisthion and nasion. Cranial vault width was defined as the linear distance between the left and right sqzy landmarks, which are defined as the point of junction between the posterior zygomatic arch and squama of the temporal bone. The above landmarks can be visualized at the following website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://getahead.psu.edu/viewer.html?id=Adult_Mouse_Skull" xlink:type="simple">http://getahead.psu.edu/viewer.html?id=Adult_Mouse_Skull</ext-link>. Cranial vault width and length measurements were used to define the cranial vault index (width x 100 / length) to further analyze 3D morphometric alterations due to treatment. Additionally, the widths of the coronal and sagittal sutures were measured at 25, 50, and 75 percent of their length as defined by the distance from the bregma to the pterion and from the bregma to the lambda, respectively. The width of the suture was defined as the distance between bony fronts at each of these points. Measures were compared at each time point by split-plot ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis where appropriate by postnatal time point or suture for effects by dose where applicable; p≤0.05 was considered significant for post-hoc Bonferonni analyses. Sex of the pups was recorded for future post-hoc investigation but was not considered a factor in current analyses. All statistical analyses were completed using SPSS 23.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). All measurements are presented as mean ±SEM.</p>

<p>After μCT scanning, representative samples (n = 3 per group) from the control unexposed and high dose exposed groups were decalcified in 0.25M EDTA at pH 7.4 for 10 days with changes every 3 days. The sutures were isolated from the calvaria, dehydrated in a graded series of ethyl alcohol (70–100%), cleared in xylene, and embedded in paraffin. Prior to embedding, samples were cut in half posterior and parallel to the coronal suture and the front half of the calvaria was again bisected along the sagittal suture to allow for embedding in an orientation that allowed for cutting through both sutures at 8 μm using a rotary microtome prior to mounting on Super Frost Plus (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) glass slides for histology. Hematoxylin and eosin staining proceeded by standard protocol. Three sections at least 30 μm apart per specimen per suture were used for histomorphometric analysis. Stained sections were photographed using a Motic Inverted Microscope with attached camera (Motic, British Columbia, Canada). Standardized variables including total suture area, suture width at the dural, middle, and periosteal edges, and suture height were measured using Image J Software (National Institutes of Health) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref048">48</xref>]. Measures were compared for the coronal and sagittal sutures using a split-plot ANOVA to investigate each suture for effects by dose, p≤0.05 was considered significant.</p>
<p>For immunohistochemistry, antigen retrieval was achieved with 10mM Sodium Citrate Buffer or Tris-EDTA Buffer (2 minutes microwave). After cooling, endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol (10 minutes) and then sections were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and blocked in 1% goat serum with 1% bovine serum albumin (10 minutes). Sections were then incubated with the following primary antibodies for one hour at room temperature or refrigerated overnight: Thyroid Receptor Alpha (AbCam, Cambridge, MA, USA, ab53729, 1:50), Thyroid Receptor Beta (AbCam ab180612, 1:50), PCNA (AbCam ab18197, 1:3000), ALP (AbCam ab108337, 1:250), HTRA1 (AbCam ab38611, 1:50), IGF1 (AbCam ab9572, 1:50), Active Caspase 3 (AbCam ab2302, 1:75). Next, sections were washed with PBS then incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody for one hour (AbCam, ab6721). Finally, diaminobenzidine (DAB) (Vector Laboratories, Bulingame, CA, USA) chromagen was used to identify immunoreactive structures and the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin for orientation. At least 3 sections per individual per treatment for each suture (sagittal and coronal), for each target were analyzed using Image J Software and the IHC Profiler Open Source Plugin for automated scoring of immunohistochemical staining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref049">49</xref>], where the output comprised of percent positivity. Measures were compared for isolated coronal and sagittal sutures via t tests or Mann Whitney U where appropriate for effects by dose; p≤0.05 was considered significant.</p>

<title>Western Blots on Suture Tissue</title>
<p>A set of randomly selected 20 day skulls (n = 3 control and n = 3 high dose) were not fixed, but were used for protein isolation from suture tissue. The coronal and sagittal sutures, including the osteogenic bony fronts, were identified and excised using a small periosteal elevator and scissors to extirpate. The extirpated tissue was then homogenized in a liquid nitrogen cooled mortar and protein was extracted with RIPA buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific). Total protein was quantified using a Bradford assay (ThermoFisher Scientific) according to manufacturer protocol. Whole tissue protein extracts were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Equal amounts of protein per lane were loaded and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). The blots were probed with the following antibodies diluted in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 with 5% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin: AKT (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA, 9272; 1:1000), pAKT (Cell Signaling 9271; 1:1000), active Caspase 3 (AbCam ab49822; 1:500), PCNA (AbCam ab18197; 1:250), B-catenin (AbCam ab2365; 1:10,000), GAPDH (AbCam ab181602; 1:10,000) and B-actin (Cell Signaling 4967; 1:10,000). Incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (AbCam ab6721; 1:3000) followed. The protein was then visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence ECL Clarity (BioRad) detection reagents. Measures were compared for isolated coronal and sagittal sutures via t-tests or Mann Whitney U where appropriate for effects by dose; p≤0.05 was considered significant.</p>

<title>Tissue Based Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction</title>
<p>A parallel set of randomly selected skulls (n = 3 control and n = 3 high dose) were not fixed, but placed in ice cold RNAlater (ThermoFisher Scientific). Subsequently, the coronal and sagittal sutures were identified and isolated as for the total protein isolation. The extirpated tissue was then homogenized in a liquid nitrogen cooled mortar and digested in TRIZOL (ThermoFisher). RNA was then isolated using the Qiagen RNEasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valenica, CA, USA) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Quantity and quality of RNA was assessed using a Synergy H1 Microplate reader and a Take3 Microvolume Plate (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA).

Note gross dysmorphology observed in the high dose exposed representative compared to control or low dose exposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167805.g001">Fig 1A–1C</xref>). Cranial growth measures were interrogated at three post-natal time points after <italic>in utero</italic> thyroxine exposure. There was approximately equal representation of sex among the 181 resulting samples (Male = 42.8%; Female = 43.3%; Undetermined = 13.9%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0167805.t001">Table 1</xref>). Results suggested arrest in growth in cranial vault length dimension after 20 days post-natal for the high dose (~667 ng per day) exposed group with control and low dose (~167 ng per day) having greater length measures at 25 days, p = 0.005 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167805.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). High dose appeared to have some compensatory growth in cranial vault width, with significantly greater measure at the 20 day time point compared to low dose exposed, p = 0.028 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167805.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). For cranial vault index these differences are accentuated where the control group had the greatest values at 20 days, and was significantly different from the high dose, p = 0.016. At 25 days, the high dose group displayed significantly different values from control and low dose groups, p&lt;0.005 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167805.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). Greater index values represent a more brachycranic phenotype suggesting growth trajectory alteration of the coronal suture for the high dose group.</p>

Representative suture histology is included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167805.g002">Fig 2A–2C</xref>. The histomorphic analysis of a subset of individuals (n = 3 per exposure) was partially corroborated in a larger sample via μCT analysis of suture widths (n = 9 per exposure) with differing measures for both coronal and sagittal suture width by dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167805.g002">Fig 2E–2G</xref>). These analyses were however not significantly different suggesting histology may be a more accurate measure for these variables most likely due to the loss of resolution when using μCT images (13 μm) compared to histological images (7 μm).</p>

<title>In utero Thyroxine Exposure Drives Increased Proliferation and Osteogenic Expression</title>
<p>As the most significant changes occurred between 20 and 25 days we chose to further investigate 20 day high dose (~667 ng per day) <italic>in utero</italic> exposed sutures histologically for factors driving the recorded morphological changes. Previous research by our group suggests thyroxine targets calvarial cells increasing proliferation and osteogenesis when treated <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref051">51</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Overall our data suggest that maternal exogenous thyroxine exposure can drive calvarial growth and suture morphology alterations. This observed alteration is consistent with previously published literature indicating suture narrowing after thyroid treatment in other animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref052">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref053">53</xref>]. We observed the cessation of growth in length of the calvaria consistent with aberrant coronal suture growth. The cessation of growth for the cranial vault length, in conjunction with the compensatory growth of the sagittal suture leading to increased cranial vault width in high dose animals at 25 days, suggests that thyroxine affects growth of the coronal suture. As observed in the representative μCT skull reconstructions, there does appear to be gross craniofacial dysmorphology and aberrant coronal suture morphology after high dose exposure. Our suture histomorphometry and μCT analyses were consistent with these results, with the histomorphometry likely being less error prone due to direct visualization of tissues. The high dose exposed animals had the smallest coronal suture area measures, with low dose exhibiting a milder phenotype. Interestingly, both low and high dose exposed animals exhibited increased area at the sagittal suture, consistent with compensatory growth. As this is a dynamic system, compensatory growth in the sagittal suture may be detected before restriction of the coronal suture can be measured via the available techniques. In fact, low dose exhibited the greatest difference which may indicate growth across the coronal suture would decrease after 25 days for these animals. This could indicate that due to thyroxine being a hormone, the low dose may not be modeling an intermediate effect, but instead we are observing a specific low dose effect. Alternatively, these observations could indicate that the window of susceptibility in the low dose animals has shifted to a later time point. However, as calvarial expansion is almost complete at this age, morphometric differences would not be expected at a later post-natal time point as brain expansion and final vault form is complete by approximately 30 days post-natal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref054">54</xref>].</p>
<p>In order to accurately capture the signaling changes that result in the altered morphology of the cranial vault at 25 days, the 20 day time point was used to determine gene and protein alterations within the treated animals. When investigating cellular processes, we concentrated on known effects of thyroid hormone on calvarial cells where increased proliferation and osteogenesis have been observed <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref051">51</xref>]. Our immunohistochemistry data suggest increased PCNA, a marker of cell proliferation in the sagittal suture, and increased ALP in the coronal suture specifically, consistent with increased bony infiltration and osteoblastic activity at the suture in the high dose exposed animals. The contrasting increase in PCNA levels in control samples in our western blot is most likely due to whole tissue protein being collected allowing for the possibility of the presence hematopoietic cells in the sample which expresses high levels of PCNA, to overshadow minute differences in cell proliferation within the suture itself. Our immunohistochemistry results show a more targeted analysis of the suture, and therefore give a better evaluation of the response of suture cells to thyroxine. This is of great interest as the sagittal suture shows signs of compensatory growth which may be consistent with increased cell proliferation. Our gene expression data corroborates these findings showing elevated expression of proliferation markers. <italic>Jun</italic> exhibited a statistically significant increase after <italic>in utero</italic> exposure to thyroxine. <italic>Jun</italic> has been shown to be important for progression of proliferating cells through G1 phase and to also act as an anti-apoptotic factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref055">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref056">56</xref>]. Although <italic>Bax</italic>, a gene related to apoptosis, did demonstrate decreased gene expression, none of the other gene targets were significantly different. In fact, our immunohistochemistry suggests an opposite, although not statistically significant, response of increased active Caspase 3 indicative of more apoptosis. Thus, due to this mixed data, most of which is not statistically significant, it is unlikely excess thyroid hormone disrupts growth via apoptosis of suture cells. Not surprisingly both <italic>Runx2</italic> and <italic>Alp</italic> were observed to have significant gene expression increases in the <italic>in utero</italic> high dose exposed sutures. This is consistent with our immunohistochemistry data and with the literature suggesting thyroid hormones to be osteogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref034">34</xref>]. We do not observe osteocalcin (<italic>Bglap</italic>) to have increased expression. In contrast, it shows a slight decrease in gene expression, although not statistically significant, compared to unexposed controls. This may be the result of active or early osteoblastic activity in the 20 day exposed sutures, as osteocalcin is considered a marker of mature osteoblasts and osteocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref057">57</xref>].</p>
<p>There was some evidence for alteration in HTRA1/IGF1 signaling axis after <italic>in utero</italic> exposure to thyroxine. It is known that thyroid hormone acts through its receptors to mediate growth in the long bones through modulation of <italic>Htra1/Igf1</italic> signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref034">34</xref>]. Here we demonstrate the presence of both alpha and beta thyroid hormone receptors in the cranial sutures suggesting circulating thyroid hormone can affect the suture through direct mechanisms. While previous studies have shown that expression levels of the alpha receptor were 10 times that of the beta receptor within long bones, we found the presence of the beta receptor is likely higher in the sutures than the alpha receptor. It is possible this result is an artifact of specificity of the antibodies to epitopes on the receptor but is more likely that presence of these receptors is both spatially and temporally regulated independently within different tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref058">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref060">60</xref>]. Further, both HTRA1 and IGF1 exhibit elevated presence and significantly increased gene expression in the high dose exposed animals at post-natal day 20. Importantly this is prior to that decrease in growth observed at 25 days post-natal compared to unexposed controls. Overall increased activity of these targets may be responsible for the tissue level changes we observed that lead to craniofacial growth alterations.</p>
<p>To further interrogate the possible signaling cascade activated by thyroxine, targets within the Akt and Wnt pathways were evaluated. Previous studies have shown that thyroid hormone can activate thyroid receptor beta by directly binding to the receptor or indirectly through increased levels of IGF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref061">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref063">63</xref>]. Our results seem to support these findings as thyroid receptor beta was shown to be present within both the coronal and sagittal suture areas and gene expression of <italic>Igf1</italic> was significantly elevated with exposure. Binding of the thyroid receptor beta, either directly by T3 or indirectly by IGF1, has been found to activate multiple signaling cascades, specifically the Akt and Wnt pathways[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref064">64</xref>]. Interestingly, while thyroxine significantly increased expression levels of <italic>Akt1</italic> within the suture tissues, downstream targets of the Akt pathway were not upregulated. This is most likely due to the fact that Akt can directly phosphorylate β-Catenin promoting its nuclear translocation and subsequent increased transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref062">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref065">65</xref>] in a cascade that more closely mimics the Wnt pathway. Thyroid receptor beta activation has also been found to facilitate Akt translocation to the nucleus in a phosphoinositide 3-kinase dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref061">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref063">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref066">66</xref>] without affecting total Akt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref067">67</xref>], which could explain that while thyroxine treatment showed significantly increased gene expression, the observed increased protein presence of Akt was not significant.</p>
<p>To evaluate if thyroxine activated Wnt signaling, targets within the pathway were assessed for gene regulation. Our results showed significant upregulation of several targets within the pathway including the Wnt co-receptors, <italic>Lrp5</italic> and <italic>Lrp6</italic>, agonists, <italic>Dkk2</italic> and <italic>Dkk3</italic>, <italic>β-catenin</italic> and downstream target, <italic>Tcf7</italic>. Subsequent increase in β-Catenin protein levels was also observed. While these results seem to indicate a Wnt pathway signaling cascade is activated by thyroxine exposure, the significant increased expression of the Wnt antagonists, <italic>Sfrp1</italic> and <italic>Sfrp4</italic>, might indicate that this effect stimulates a negative feedback loop or increases in non-canonical signaling. Alternatively, β-catenin is also known to translocate to the nucleus following phosphorylation by Akt independent of canonical Wnt signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref065">65</xref>], which may indicate cross-talk between the Akt and Wnt pathways that circumvents any negative feedback from <italic>Sfrp1</italic> and <italic>Sfrp4</italic>. Future <italic>in vitro</italic> cell studies evaluating Akt and β-Catenin interaction and more specifically their translocation into the nucleus, are necessary to characterize the nuances of the signaling cascade activated by exogenous thyroxine exposure.</p>
<p>Overall it appears exogenous thyroid hormone exposures may be linked to calvarial growth and suture morphology alterations. This seems to involve increased activity of the Htra1/Igf1, Akt, and Wnt signaling axes leading to proliferation and osteoblastic activity at the calvarial sutures at 20 days post-natal. Increased activity of this nature disrupts homeostasis of the sutures which are normally a fibroblast rich, undifferentiated environment that is permissive of brain expansion. Recently, cells within the suture have been identified as plastic or to be “mesenchymal stem cells” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref068">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref069">69</xref>]. These resident cell populations may play an integral role in maintenance of the suture by either cell/cell signaling or the mere presence of cells that are not osteoblasts within the suture environment. Although our data suggest increased proliferation and osteogenesis as a key to exogenous thyroid hormone driven calvarial growth alteration and disruption, the susceptible resident cell populations remain to be interrogated. While previous research has indicated crosstalk between the Htra1/Igf1, Akt, and Wnt pathways after thyroid exposure leading to a synergistic effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167805.ref063">63</xref>], further characterization of the signaling cascade is required to determine how thyroid exposure results in craniosynostosis. Future research should concentrate on the culprit cell type(s) responsive and responsible for this caustic interaction with a goal of developing a cell based targeted therapy to decrease incidence of craniosynostosis caused by exogenous thyroid hormone exposure.</p>
