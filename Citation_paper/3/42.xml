<abstract>
<p>Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods are driving profound changes in biomedical research, with a growing impact on patient care. Many academic medical centers are evaluating potential models to prepare for the rapid increase in NGS information needs. This study sought to investigate (1) how and where sequencing data is generated and analyzed, (2) research objectives and goals for NGS, (3) workforce capacity and unmet needs, (4) storage capacity and unmet needs, (5) available and anticipated funding resources, and (6) future challenges. As a precursor to informed decision making at our institution, we undertook a systematic needs assessment of investigators using survey methods. We recruited 331 investigators from over 60 departments and divisions at the University of Pittsburgh Schools of Health Sciences and had 140 respondents, or a 42% response rate. Results suggest that both sequencing and analysis bottlenecks currently exist. Significant educational needs were identified, including both investigator-focused needs, such as selection of NGS methods suitable for specific research objectives, and program-focused needs, such as support for training an analytic workforce. The absence of centralized infrastructure was identified as an important institutional gap. Key principles for organizations managing this change were formulated based on the survey responses. This needs assessment provides an in-depth case study which may be useful to other academic medical centers as they identify and plan for future needs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Next generation sequencing (NGS), with its high-throughput and range of applications, is revolutionizing life science research. NGS techniques are being used in research as diverse as the study of the microbiome [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], complexity of alternative splicing [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and the mutational landscape in cancer [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. NGS technologies are also beginning to impact the practice of medicine through the use of disease-targeted clinical sequencing [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], for example in cancer treatment selection [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131166.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. With further research, a more personalized, precise, and predictive model for medicine may be possible [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, wider adoption of high throughput technology could also significantly stress academic medical centers, which are already burdened by decreased resources. To better understand what institutional resources are most important to support research communities that are adopting these technologies, we developed and administered an NGS needs assessment survey to a large number of biomedical researchers at a single university associated with an academic medical center (AMC).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002" sec-type="intro">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Next generation sequencing techniques developed rapidly after the publication of the first draft of the human genome, with the introduction of massively parallel sequencing (MPS) technology in 2005 [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Parallelization of NGS technologies provided a faster, higher-throughput and lower cost method for sequencing than the traditional Sanger dideoxynucleotide sequencing method [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The cost of generating a whole human genome sequence reflected these advances: the cost has plummeted from the estimated price of $2.7 billion for the first genome draft sequence in 2001 to commercial sequencing costs of approximately $1,000 dollars for an entire genome in 2014 [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
<p>There are now a number of competing NGS platforms, including Complete Genomics, Illumina HiSeq, Life Technologies SOLiD and Ion Torrent, Pacific Biosciences SMRT, and Roche 454 [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131166.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These platforms differ in sequencing chemistry, PCR amplification methods, read lengths, types of errors, overall error rates, and methods for downstream bioinformatics analysis [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Examples of specialized applications include whole genome sequencing (WGS) [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], whole exome sequencing (WES) [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], RNA-Seq [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], ChIP-Seq [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], chromatin conformation (Hi-C) [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and Methyl-Seq [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], each with its own sophisticated data analysis pipeline. For researchers unfamiliar with these myriad technologies and applications, choosing the appropriate platform for a particular research question may appear to be a daunting challenge. The choice of platform is often determined by cost, institutional resources for sequencing, data management, storage, and bioinformatics capabilities. Our survey questions were designed to understand researchers’ levels of familiarity with these emerging technologies. Additionally, the questions sought to determine researchers’ current use of institutional versus external resources for each step of the sequencing pipeline.</p>
<p>Regardless of platform or application, NGS experiments generate large amounts of data–so called ‘Big Data’ [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131166.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]–posing both data management and data analysis challenges. A single human whole genome sequence can generate 100–250 GB of data; therefore, even small research projects can quickly exceed the data storage capacity of individual labs [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It can be challenging for researchers to evaluate and implement the wide variety of storage solutions, each with various benefits and drawbacks. Cloud based storage and analysis solutions offer the benefits of no startup fees, relatively inexpensive long term storage, elasticity, and relatively rapid data access [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In comparison, keeping data locally in hard drives or storage arrays requires a one-time cost, provides vastly quicker data access, offers more direct control over security risks, and may have fewer regulatory complexities when compared to cloud based approaches [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. From a budgetary perspective, all of these storage solutions are significantly more expensive than anything previously encountered in life science research. The NGS survey questions were designed to discern researchers’ familiarity with storage issues, including budgetary considerations, in order to guide future recommendations for institution-wide NGS infrastructure in networking and storage.</p>
<p>Data is considered the fourth paradigm for science, the first three being experimental, theoretical, and computational science [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. NGS data offers unprecedented detail; however, the current rate of NGS data generation outpaces the rate at which we are able to analyze it. The complexity of NGS data analysis requires specialized interdisciplinary skills in biology, computing, information technology, and statistics [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131166.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. For example, a typical RNA Seq experiment analysis pipeline (alignment of reads to the reference genome, transcript quantification, and differential expression [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]) requires all of the above-mentioned skills. With the predicted increase in demand for data analysts and the lack of personnel with bioinformatics skills, NGS data analysis could become a significant bottleneck in biomedical research. Through this study, we also sought to understand the scope of the data analysis challenge, including researchers’ familiarity with computing resources such as cluster computing and whether individual investigators either have bioinformatics personnel in their laboratories or alternative solutions to meet their analysis needs.</p>

<title>Setting</title>
<p>University of Pittsburgh Health Sciences (UPHS) encompasses the Schools of Medicine, Public Health, Nursing, Dental medicine, Health and Rehabilitation, and Pharmacy, and is closely affiliated with UPMC, the single largest health care provider in western Pennsylvania. More than 2,000 individual researchers are included among the health science faculty. University of Pittsburgh is currently ranked number 5 in NIH funding. The Institute of Personalized Medicine was established in 2013 by University of Pittsburgh and UPMC to apply new knowledge in genetics, genomics, and other fields to advance evidence-based medicine.</p>

<sec id="sec005">
<title>Survey Instrument</title>
<p>We developed an online survey instrument to elicit current and anticipated needs from researchers using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods and data. Initial survey questions identified investigators who were currently using, planning on using, or not planning to use high throughput sequencing methods and to analyze resulting data. Investigators then responded to a set of survey questions specific to each of these three groups. Questions sought to elicit the following information: (1) how and where sequencing data is generated and analyzed, (2) research objectives and goals for NGS, (3) workforce capacity and unmet needs, (4) storage capacity and unmet needs, (5) available and anticipated funding resources, and (6) future challenges. Question types included multiple choice, Likert scale, ranking, rating scale, and fill-in-the-blank responses. Each participant answered a varying number of questions based on prior responses, ranging from a minimum of 9 and a maximum of 52 questions. The survey was created and administered on Survey Monkey.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec006">
<title>Recruitment</title>
<p>Participants were identified using searches performed on NIH RePORTER, PubMed, University of Pittsburgh Digital Vita research profiles, and University of Pittsburgh Schools of Health Sciences departmental websites. RePORTER and PubMed searches were specific to University of Pittsburgh and included one query specific to next generation sequencing, and another more broadly termed for genetic data. Institutional profile searches included terms relevant to sequencing and next generation sequencing. We also included faculty from departmental websites with stated interests in human genetics, human genomics, or sequencing. The final list was vetted by university scientific leaders to identify any investigators working in this area who were not already included. For each unique participant, we collected contact information, as well as School and Department or Division from the university directory.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec007">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>We invited participation of 331 investigators from over 60 departments and divisions at the University of Pittsburgh Schools of Health Sciences and at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. Investigators were recruited by email invitation from institutional leaders containing a link to the survey. After the initial email, one subsequent reminder was mailed. A total of 140 respondents participated in the survey, a response rate of 42%. The research was approved as an Exempt study by the University of Pittsburgh IRB (PRO12110213). No consent was obtained. An informational script was used to (1) explain the purpose of the study, (2) describe how the data would be anonymized and protected, and (3) indicate that participants were free to withdraw at any time. The University of Pittsburgh IRB approved this procedure.</p>

<title>How and where NGS data are being generated</title>
<p>Among <italic>Current Users</italic>, 43% are currently performing high throughput sequencing within the institution. Most of these respondents indicated that they used a core facility at their institution (58%) or a university collaborator’s lab (45%). Only 13% of researchers who are sequencing used an NG sequencer within their own laboratory. Among the 57% of <italic>Current Users</italic> who are not performing high throughput sequencing in the institution, 52% expect to be sequencing samples at the institution during the next two years. Eighty-two percent of these respondents expect to use a core facility at the university.

<p>More than half of <italic>Current Users</italic> (56%) are outsourcing sequencing of samples to an external, non-university facility. Among these investigators, 45% are also sequencing within the university, while 55% are not performing any high-throughput sequencing within the university. Sixty percent of these respondents have sent samples to another academic institution for sequencing, and 43% have sent samples to a commercial sequencing service. Thirty-one percent of <italic>Current Users</italic> who are not yet outsourcing samples for sequencing expect to begin outsourcing in the next two years, with 50% of respondents planning to utilize academic institutions and 50% expecting to use commercial services.</p>

<title>Challenges to NGS sequencing and analysis</title>
<p>We asked <italic>All Users</italic> about perceived challenges to analyzing and storing sequencing data, workflow, and cloud computing/storage (<xref rid="pone.0131166.t009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>). Each item was rated on a scale from 1 (not at all challenging) to 5 (very challenging). All challenges were rated as somewhat difficult to overcome on average. Respondents (<italic>n</italic> = 77) perceived that sample preparation or library construction was the easiest task, with an average difficulty of 2.4. The two most challenging tasks were finding a person to perform the analysis (3.6) and how to meet the cost (3.7). Almost all items in the analyzing and storing sequencing data category were rated above average difficulty (3). This indicates that there are hurdles to overcome in all categories, but that they are not insurmountable.</p>

Among these investigators, 38% have research questions that next generation sequencing can answer. Among respondents who have research questions that NGS can answer, 30% of respondents have investigated options for sequencing. Only 10% of these respondents know what technologies, methods, or platforms to use, but 78% report that they know where to find help to make decisions about which methods, technologies, or platforms to use.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Advances in high throughput sequencing are fundamentally changing biomedical research and patient care–supporting a new paradigm of <italic>personalized medicine</italic> that includes genomic analysis as part of diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131166.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although it provides significant promise, the ‘path to personalized medicine’ [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] is also likely to produce significant changes in the needs of the research community. Despite this emerging challenge, few roadmaps exist to help academic medical centers anticipate and plan for changing needs in this field. Following the establishment of the Institute for Personalized Medicine (IPM) at University of Pittsburgh, we undertook a systematic analysis of the data management needs of health sciences investigators who are either using or planning to use NGS methods. As a leading research institution (currently ranked 5<sup>th</sup> in NIH funding) associated with a large vertically-integrated health care system (UPMC), this needs assessment provides an in-depth case study which may be of use to other AMCs as they identify and plan for future needs.</p>
<p>This discussion is organized around a set of key principles emerging from our survey, primarily focused on development of appropriate IT infrastructure, support of analytical resources, and education. Using these principles, our institution has launched specific initiatives designed to enhance our maturing ability to support the use of next generation sequencing for translational sciences. For each principle, we provide examples from our efforts, as well as limitations and pitfalls for development within this rapidly changing environment.</p>
<sec id="sec018">
<title>1. Cultivate strategic partnerships with research computing groups within the organization</title>
<p>The scale of NGS presents data management challenges not previously encountered by many institutions [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. As AMCs develop information architectures, centers of expertise, and human processes to support personalized medicine initiatives, they can anticipate further strain on core resources [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Institutional support for data management will likely require partnerships that extend beyond traditional AMC boundaries, such as partnerships with industry and scientific computing centers. Forging such partnerships may be an important early step in program development.</p>
<p>An important early step at our institution was the development of a campus-wide strategic task force designed to specifically address the institutional aspects of managing this transition. In an effort to directly address the infrastructure needs elicited from participants, the Task Force and the Institute for Personalized Medicine assisted the Schools of the Health Sciences at University of Pittsburgh in developing strategic partnerships, both internally and externally. The Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] now hosts more than one petabyte of Pitt/UPMC NGS data on PSC’s proprietary Data Exacell parallel file system [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]–a set of high performance software and hardware building blocks for scientific computing, which is funded by the National Science Foundation. At the same time, we have significantly invested in the University Simulation and Modeling Center (SaM)[<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], a centralized research computing group supporting several large-scale computing clusters. SaM provides high-quality, investigator-focused software and hardware resources, as well as consultants to assist researchers in moving their analysis pipelines to a clustered computing environment. These strategic partnerships have provided researchers using NGS methods at our University with access to significant storage and computational resources.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec019">
<title>2. Build for high-throughput as well as high-performance computing needs</title>
<p>Results from our survey suggested a wide array of research objectives that require diverse computational infrastructures. High Performance Computing (HPC) environments provide parallel computing with infrastructures built for capability over capacity. In these types of environments, jobs typically require many hundreds or even thousands of CPUs, and potentially many gigabytes or even terabytes of memory, but very little storage. Job components need to communicate with one another over the entire set of CPUs. Under these conditions, large shared memory, message-passing interfaces, and low latency interconnects are essential for some important NGS computational tasks such as denovo RNA and DNA assembly. However, for most NGS computational tasks, the processing capacity may outweigh capability. In these situations, High Throughput Computing (HTC) architectures are typically preferred, allowing distribution of many thousands of jobs with low CPU requirements, and little to no inter-process communication, but much larger storage requirements. Bioinformatics pipelines can often be efficiently deployed in such HTC environments. As we develop our partnerships with the Simulation Modeling Center (SaM) and the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, which use both HPC and HTC environments, we are refining our understanding of how to use each set of resources to its best advantage, and how to best direct researchers to the appropriate resources for their work.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec020">
<title>3. Develop centralized NGS data management as well as analysis</title>
<p>Centralized computing resources such as PSC and SaM provide important physical infrastructure including compute nodes, storage, networking, security, and support for managing the regulatory compliance aspects needed for NGS research [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. But actual management of NGS data requires an investment beyond such physical infrastructure, including support for data provenance, integration, processing, and analysis. Specific centralized data management efforts can increase efficiency and reduce barriers to entry for investigators who are starting to use NGS in their labs. An advantage of centralizing data management infrastructure is that a diverse array of technologies can be employed to tier data based on the frequency with which the data must be accessed. Centralized infrastructure can also stage data between locations in advance of the movement to specific locations as part of the analysis workflow.</p>
<p>As an example, our survey showed that a large number of investigators were either currently using or interested in using TCGA data [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Consequently, we developed a process to automatically download, version, store, and update TCGA data (including BAM files) at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, and to use the PSC distributed file system to make these same files available at the Simulation and Modeling Center. The process enables resources from both centers to be used with TCGA data. The Pittsburgh Genome Resource Repository (PGRR) supports a multi-investigator collaborative effort to use multi-institutional datasets such as TCGA for NGS analysis and personalized medicine. Collocating such large NGS datasets with relevant tools and compute resources at two research computing units has greatly enhanced the availability and utility of this dataset to our research community.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec021">
<title>4. Anticipate future use of cloud-computing, while recognizing its limitations</title>
<p>Cloud-based storage and analysis are increasingly popular for NGS data [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], because of the relative flexibility, scalability, and affordability [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131166.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Genomics cloud computing providers, such as Globus Genomics, Google Genomics, and Amazon Web Services, offer services using a variety of models and pipelines. More specific cloud-based bioinformatics workflow platforms provide further capabilities [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131166.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. These resources offer significant advantages for some NGS analysis use cases [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], particularly for researchers who have a single set of samples to examine. In contrast, for projects which are constantly accruing participants, or for ongoing efforts such as those envisioned in a personalized medicine setting, long-term storage of large data sets and repeated re-analysis of data make in-house computing resources far more cost effective than cloud providers. For investigators working with dbGAP datasets, Data Use Terms previously restricted use of cloud providers for protected data. But recent shifts in NIH policy [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], aligned with early experiments in NIH cloud-based resources, are significantly changing the landscape. Investigators in our institution are already using cloud resources for their own NGS projects, and we are beginning to consider how to leverage cloud providers through capabilities such as “cloud-bursting” (offloading jobs from overloaded computing resources in our institution to cloud providers on an as-needed basis). At the same time, many AMCs remain concerned about the wholesale use of cloud computing providers for sequencing data. Although research NGS data does not technically meet the definition of Protected Health Information, it is nonetheless sensitive personal information, incurring risk for re-identification or misuse [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. New HIPAA-compliant cloud resources should help to alleviate these concerns, but will also require more significant investment for their use.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec022">
<title>5. Consider institution-wide sequencing capacity and plan for sustainable growth</title>
<p>As shown in this survey, sequencing is an important bottleneck for NGS data processing. In our institutions, investigators are meeting their sequencing needs through a wide range of methods, from core resources to commercial providers. Choices are often specific to the needs of individual projects. Researchers may require an array of other services, from sample preparation to analysis and storage, as well as expertise in interpretation. Access to sequencing resources is becoming increasingly routine, and even amenable to “comparison shopping” through marketplace applications such as GenoHub [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In many respects, the key barrier is now cost. With a tightened NIH budget, traditional sources of funding are greatly reduced. Pilot programs such as those offered locally through Cancer Center Support Grants and Clinical and Translational Sciences Awards can provide vital seed funding for investigators to accrue preliminary data for grant applications. However, a more cohesive and long term strategy is needed to develop a sustainable model for funding NGS data generation. This could include negotiating larger volume contracts at reduced price and/or enhanced service, or explicitly funneling low complexity projects to commodity resources. Institutions that address these problems early on may benefit as demand increases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec023">
<title>6. Develop core analytic groups with financial model for escalating needs</title>
<p>NGS analysis requires specialized expertise that blends biological, statistical, computational, and communication skills [<xref rid="pone.0131166.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. AMCs can anticipate the need for more analytic capabilities as demand increases. While researchers can be expected to contribute to the costs of these core analytic groups, it is impractical to expect that all operational costs can be absorbed by the projects themselves. Using a cost-sharing model where a portion of the support for core analytical groups is provided by the University and a portion is shouldered by the investigators, we have increased our analytic capabilities significantly. As investigators request analytic help from our Bioinformatics Core Service, we apportion analysis time and hire new analysts as workloads increase. Institutional resources help cover intervals with lighter workloads, and enable hiring of new analysts before they reach 100% salary coverage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec024">
<title>7. Invest in bioinformatics training at all levels</title>
<p>Significant educational needs were identified in this rapidly changing domain. Individuals currently tasked with analyzing NGS data in individual labs often have very limited training in bioinformatics. To meet these immediate needs, workshops and other short-term programming for laboratory staff engaged in NGS analysis can provide an immediate way to address educational gaps. At our institution, an intensive three week summer NGS workshop run by one of our authors (MB) provides hands-on training in NGS analysis using datasets, tools, and infrastructures available at our institution. Over 250 individuals have attended this workshop in the last three years. This program fills a critical niche for training staff, students, and postdocs who are working with NGS data. An advantage of a workshop run within the institution is that it fosters development of a community among analysts in the research labs, and between these individuals and the analysts in the bioinformatics core services. Institutions also need to further invest in NGS by addressing educational gaps with long-term strategies, such as developing, sustaining, and expanding formal bioinformatics undergraduate and graduate programs. As a result of this survey and current trends in genomics and bioinformatics, we are expanding several existing graduate training programs and are partnering with other departments such as Computer Science and Information Science to develop innovative new training programs. Looking forward, federal support for programs that seek to retrain qualified bioscience PhDs and postdoctoral trainees may also help establish a larger bioinformatics workforce.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study provides an in-depth analysis of the current and planned use of NGS data analysis for health sciences research at a single academic medical center. Our findings suggest significant institutional challenges that AMCs can address to enhance their capacity for growth in genomic medicine, including infrastructure issues, support for centralized analytic resources, and education. Key principles for change management in this rapidly evolving space are presented. Based on these principles, our institution has taken initial steps towards development of Big Data infrastructure. Early strategic planning by AMCs will help to prevent the development of individually-targeted solutions, which may produce considerable fractionation of resources and duplication of services. Development of a campus-wide task force to address infrastructure and analytic issues is recommended to ensure that all members of the community benefit from the proposed changes.</p>
