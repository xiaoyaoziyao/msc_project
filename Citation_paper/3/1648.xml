        <p>Eukaryotic genes are distributed along chromosomes as clusters of highly expressed genes termed RIDGEs (Regions of IncreaseD Gene Expression) and lowly expressed genes termed anti-RIDGEs, interspersed among genes expressed at intermediate levels or not expressed. Previous studies based on this observation suggested a dual mechanism of gene regulation, where, in addition to transcription factors, the chromosomal domain influences the expression level of their embedded genes. The objectives here were to provide evidence for the existence of chromosomal regional regulation of transcription in the bovine genome, to analyse the genomic features of genes located within RIDGEs versus anti-RIDGEs and tissue-specific genes versus housekeeping and to examine the genomic distribution of genes subject to positive selection in bovines. Gene expression analysis of four brain tissues and the anterior pituitary of 28 cows identified 70 RIDGEs and 41 anti-RIDGEs (harbouring 3735 and 1793 bovine genes respectively) across the bovine genome which are significantly higher than expected by chance. Housekeeping genes (defined here as genes expressed in all five tissues) were over-represented within RIDGEs but tissue-specific genes (genes expressed in only one of the five tissues) were not. Housekeeping genes and genes within RIDGEs had, in general, higher expression levels and GC content but shorter gene lengths and intron lengths than tissue-specific genes and genes within anti-RIDGES. Our findings suggest the existence of chromosomal regional regulation of transcription in the bovine genome. The genomic features observed for genes within RIDGEs and housekeeping genes in bovines agree with previous studies in several other species further strengthening the hypothesis of selective pressure to keep the highly and widely expressed genes short and compact for transcriptional efficiency. Further, positively selected genes were found non-randomly distributed on the genome with a preference for RIDGEs and regions of intermediate gene expression compared to anti-RIDGEs.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Eukaryotic genes are not randomly distributed along chromosomes but organised as clusters of highly expressed genes, termed RIDGEs (Regions of IncreaseD Gene Expression), and lowly expressed genes, termed anti-RIDGEs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Caron1">[1]</xref>, interspersed among genes expressed at intermediate levels or not expressed. Certain genomic features observed for RIDGEs were in striking contrast with those for anti-RIDGEs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Versteeg1">[2]</xref>. RIDGEs were found to be gene dense, GC rich and SINE repeat rich and mostly harboured genes with shorter than average intron sizes. In contrast, anti-RIDGES showed low gene density, were AT rich and LINE repeat rich. Surprisingly, the gene expression patterns of highly and weakly expressed chromosomal regions were roughly similar in all 12 human tissues analysed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Caron1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Versteeg1">[2]</xref>. Based on their findings, Versteeg <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Versteeg1">[2]</xref> postulated that RIDGEs globally govern the expression levels of their embedded genes and that this higher level regulation of gene transcription was dependent on factors that act on chromosomal domains like chromatin conformation and position in the nucleus. The existence of this novel domain wide transcription regulatory mechanism, in addition to the well-known regulatory mechanism at the individual gene level that involve transcription factors and regulatory sequences on the gene, was proven in a later study by Gierman <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Gierman1">[3]</xref>. They showed that the expression levels of identical green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter constructs integrated at several different chromosomal positions corresponded to the overall expression level of genes within the domains of integration. To explain this, a dual mechanism of gene regulation was suggested wherein transcription factors determine a basal level of transcription for a gene, whereas the chromosomal domain in which the gene was located determined its ultimate expression level. They also established a range for the sizes of such chromosomal domains by showing that the correlation between GFP expression and domain activity was highest for window sizes of roughly 19–79 genes around the integration sites.</p>
      <p>The observation of clusters of highly expressed genes was reported to be a consequence of the clustering of housekeeping (HK) genes, which in turn, was probably the outcome of selective pressure to position widely expressed genes in genomic regions where the higher-order chromatin structure allows better accessibility to the transcription machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Lercher1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Lercher2">[5]</xref>. However, RIDGEs are not restricted to HK genes, but encode tissue-specific (TS) genes too <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Versteeg1">[2]</xref>. Moreover, not all genes on a RIDGE are highly expressed but the average expression level of all genes per cluster taken together would be higher than the average gene expression across the genome. Nevertheless, RIDGEs consist of a higher proportion of HK genes than would be expected by chance and the HK genes share certain genomic features with genes on RIDGEs such as higher expression levels and shorter lengths for introns, genes and coding sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Nie1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Nie2">[7]</xref>. It has been proposed that since transcription is an energy expensive process, there is an evolutionary selection pressure for economy of transcription to keep widely and highly expressed genes short and compact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Nie1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Eisenberg1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-CastilloDavis1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Vinogradov1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The phenomenon of domain wide regulation of transcription has been shown to exist in several species: mammals (human, mouse) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Caron1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Versteeg1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Gierman1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Singer1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Mijalski1">[12]</xref>, flies (drosophila) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Spellman1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Boutanaev1">[14]</xref> and recently in birds (chicken) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Nie1">[6]</xref>. Though believed to be a feature for all eukaryotes, this has been experimentally verified only in a few species. The recently published bovine genome assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Liu1">[15]</xref> allowed us for the first time to investigate the existence of chromosomal regional regulation of transcription in bovines using a brain transcriptome dataset of closely related tissues: Amygdala (AM), Hippocampus (HC), Dorsal Hypothalamus (DH), Ventral Hypothalamus (VH) and Anterior Pituitary (AP). Prior to this study, it was not known whether the phenomenon of chromosomal regional regulation of transcription existed in bovine genome and whether the genomic features for RIDGEs and anti-RIDGEs reported in earlier studies in other species could be expected in bovines as well. It was also not known whether the above mentioned findings could be expected when closely related tissues are analysed as was done here, which is in contrast to previous studies that used gene expression data from a wide variety of tissues.</p>
      <p>A study on expression levels of genes subject to positive selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Kosiol1">[16]</xref> showed that positively selected genes, in general, had reduced expression levels and were expressed in a TS manner in several human tissues. Targets of positive selection have been linked to complex trait phenotypes in humans and primates where adaptation to local environmental changes has been the driving force. Likewise, in laboratory, farm and companion animals, human intervention in the form of domestication and intensive artificial selection may have been additional drivers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Kosiol1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Voight1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Fang1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Flori1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Biswas1">[20]</xref>. Therefore the quest for genes controlling complex traits of interest in domesticated animals may be supported by finding signatures of positive selection and regional patterns of gene expression that help narrow down the regions on the genome to look for these genes.</p>
      <p>The primary objectives of this study were: 1. to provide evidence for the existence of chromosomal regional regulation of transcription in the bovine genome, 2. to analyse the genomic features of genes located within RIDGEs versus anti-RIDGEs and TS genes versus HK, and 3. to examine the genomic distribution of genes subject to positive selection in bovines.</p>
      <p>Here, HK refers to genes expressed in all five tissues studied here and TS refers to genes expressed in only one of the five tissues.</p>

        <p>The normalised transformed gene expression data matrix analysed here consisted of average expression per tissue for 13,234 bovine Ensembl genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020413.s004">Table S1</xref>). Prior to averaging, a hierarchical cluster analysis of the normalised gene intensities per individual per tissue showed clustering by tissue type. Among the brain areas, the AM and HC clustered closer to each other and so did DH and VH, whereas the AP stood out as a separate cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020413.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The chromosome lengths and chromosome wise distribution of all bovine Ensembl genes and of those bovine genes on the BOMC array represented by good quality probes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> section) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020413-g001">Figure 1</xref>. The number of Ensembl genes represented on the re-annotated BOMC array was roughly 50% of the total known Ensembl genes on each chromosome. The total bovine genome size analysed in this study was 2,608,296,415 bp which was approximately 91% of the latest bovine genome assembly version Btau_4.0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Liu1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-The1">[21]</xref> having an estimated genome size of 2.87 Gb. Chromosomes 3, 5, 7, 18 and 19 have the most genes, with over 1100 each. The bovine chromosomes 18 and 19 (BTA18 and BTA19), though ranked 21<sup>st</sup> and 23<sup>rd</sup> respectively by length, are ranked fifth and third respectively by the number of genes harboured. We used the “Synteny Tracker” tool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Donthu1">[22]</xref> to identify syntenic regions between the bovine and human genomes. The high gene density of these bovine chromosomes corresponds to the high gene density of their syntenic human chromosomes. BTA18 shared a large syntenic region with HSA19 which has the highest gene density amongst human chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Grimwood1">[23]</xref> and also with HSA16 which is of moderate gene density <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Martin1">[24]</xref>. Likewise, BTA19 was almost entirely syntenic with HSA17 which has the second highest gene density amongst human chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Zody1">[25]</xref>.</p>

        <p>RIDGEs and anti-RIDGEs were so selected that each covers approximately 10% of the bovine genome (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> section). For our dataset, this criterion was satisfied by taking the expression thresholds as 1.25 times larger than the genomic median expression value in the case of RIDGEs and 1.45 times lower than the genomic median expression value for anti-RIDGEs. With the chosen window size of 39 genes and genome coverage threshold of 10%, a reasonable number of RIDGEs and anti-RIDGEs could be identified: 70 RIDGEs harbouring 3735 bovine Ensembl genes and 41 anti-RIDGEs harbouring 1793 bovine Ensembl genes. The chromosome wise distribution of these RIDGEs and anti-RIDGEs is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020413-g002">Figure 2</xref> and their genomic locations on the bovine genome are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020413.s005">Table S2</xref>.

Number ‘5’ represents genes expressed in all 5 tissues which we defined here as HK genes (total of 3651). The distribution of the 1035 TS genes across individual tissues is also shown (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020413.s006">Table S3</xref> for list of HK and TS genes). The maximum number of TS genes was seen for the AP (490) which is an endocrine gland. The brain areas, being all of neurological tissue type, share a lot of functions in common and therefore genes. Hence the number of unique TS genes found were smaller (141 for AM, 102 for HC, 239 for DH, 63 for VH). Functional analysis of the orthologous human genes of the bovine genes (human orthologues used for better annotation information available) in R package ‘GOstats’ (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) revealed enriched gene ontology and KEGG pathway terms for the HK and TS genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020413.s007">Table S4</xref>). In most cases, the terms were not significant at a Benjamini-Hochberg p-value threshold of 0.1, hence the top 10–15 terms were considered to get an indication of the most important functions. Briefly, functional analysis of TS genes per tissue revealed processes like ‘negative regulation of synaptic transmission, glutamatergic’, ‘negative regulation of transmission of nerve impulse’ and ‘regulation of behaviour’ for the anterior pituitary, and processes like ‘androgen receptor signalling pathway’, ‘neurotransmitter catabolic process’, ‘behavioural response to pain’ for the brain areas. For HK genes, general processes related to ATP synthesis, mitotic activity and translation, typical of most tissues, were found to be enriched.</p>

        <title>Genes subject to positive selection are not randomly distributed on the genome</title>
        <p>Out of the 71 genes reported to be subject to positive selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-The1">[21]</xref>, 54 could be mapped to bovine Ensembl genes with a known genomic location. Of these 54 genes, 12 were found to be located within RIDGEs whereas only one was within an anti-RIDGE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020413.s008">Table S5</xref>). This suggests that genes under positive selection are not randomly distributed on the genome (p&lt;0.01) but are less likely to be within anti-RIDGEs i.e. more likely to be found within RIDGEs and regions of intermediate gene expression.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Hierarchical clustering of the arrays showed that arrays clustered based on tissue type but not on days (day0 and day12). The AP being an endocrine gland is clearly different from the brain tissues and this was evident in the clustering results. Among the brain areas, the AM and HC tended to cluster together which may be explained by the close physical and functional proximity between these tissues in the brain. Similarly, the DH and VH are closer to each other physically and functionally as they share many nuclei.</p>
      <p>A number of regions of high and low gene expression along the chromosomes were identified. The probability to find as many regions of high and low gene expression as found in our analysis purely by chance is below 10% for RIDGEs and below 1% for anti-RIDGEs, suggesting that RIDGEs and anti-RIDGEs are not a random feature but have an underlying purpose. Given the fact that our data is based on only about 13,000 genes corresponding to good quality probes on the array, we expect more significant results if we had greater number of genes under study. Therefore, even the relatively high 10% chance for RIDGEs may be considered to reflect the trend that RIDGEs are not a random feature in bovine genome. Moreover, the high correlations among the transcriptome maps from the five tissues studied here suggest that regional differences in transcription are a general trend in the bovine genome. High correlations in the global transcriptome profile between diverse tissues have been reported earlier in other species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Eisenberg1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>HK and TS genes were also identified and the fact that HK genes were significantly over-represented on RIDGEs indicates that most of these genes are expressed at a relatively high level. The observations on genomic features of RIDGE versus anti-RIDGE genes and of HK versus TS genes are in agreement with previous studies on human, chicken and other vertebrates. Hence this study extends these general observations also to bovines. The high degree of correlation between gene expression levels and genomic features may indicate an evolutionary adaptation for energy efficiency of transcription by keeping genes which are highly and widely expressed, short and compact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Nie1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Eisenberg1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-CastilloDavis1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Vinogradov1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Analysis of the TS genes for enriched gene ontology terms revealed neurological processes as expected for TS genes. For the HK genes, even though our definition was based on only 5 tissues of which 4 were of neurological type, processes enriched among those genes were general processes related to energy metabolism, cell division, transcription etc. expected of most tissues and cells as they are HK functions. However, it is not possible to conclusively prove that all these genes as truly HK in the absence of information from other diverse tissues and physiological conditions of expression. Hence the HK genes reported here, as defined earlier, only represent genes expressed in all brain tissues represented here and the anterior pituitary.</p>
      <p>RIDGEs were suggested to be preferred sites for formation of chromosomal aberrations, development of gene deregulation as in tumours and evolutionary breakpoints in mammalian evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Folle1">[26]</xref>. Here, we found that positively selected genes were preferentially distributed on RIDGEs and regions of intermediate gene expression compared to anti-RIDGEs. This finding seems to contradict that in an earlier study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Kosiol1">[16]</xref>, where it was shown that positively selected genes had reduced expression levels and were expressed in a TS manner in several human tissues. However, it may be noted that selection pressures acting on bovines could be quite different than those in humans, particularly because of the effects of domestication and intensive artificial selection in bovines for traits preferred by humans. For example, positively selected genes in bovines include a number of immune related genes which probably arose in response to the substantial rumen microbial load or due to keeping cattle in herds where rapid disease transmission is a persistent threat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-The1">[21]</xref>. Other points to note while comparing our results with those of other studies which may be based on a large number of diverse tissues is that our definition of HK and TS genes are based on only five closely related tissues and that HK genes as defined in our study could overlap with brain-specific genes of other studies.</p>
      <p>To conclude, our findings suggest the existence of chromosomal regional regulation of transcription in the bovine genome. The HK and TS genes reported here represent a useful resource for further studying bovine brain expressed genes. The genomic features observed for genes within RIDGEs and HK genes in bovines agree with previous studies in several other species further strengthening the hypothesis of selective pressure to keep the highly and widely expressed genes short and compact for transcriptional efficiency. Another striking observation was that positively selected genes were non-randomly distributed on the genome with a preference for RIDGEs and regions of intermediate gene expression compared to anti-RIDGEs.</p>

        <p>The microarray experiment was carried out as part of a study aimed at identifying and studying genes that contribute to differences in oestrous behaviour expression and fertility levels of dairy cows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Kommadath1">[27]</xref>. Briefly, oestrous behaviour was recorded in 28 healthy Holstein Friesian cows from 30 days in milk (DIM) onwards till their time of sacrifice which varied between 77 and 139 DIM i.e. after at least 2 oestrous cycles. Samples from 4 brain areas (dorsal hypothalamus, ventral hypothalamus, amygdala and hippocampus) and the anterior pituitary were collected from these cows, 14 of which were sacrificed at start of oestrus and 14 at mid of oestrous cycle. The cows were euthanized in a stress-free, quick and standardized way and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.</p>
        <p>RNA extracted from brain tissue samples were hybridized on Bovine 24K oligonucleotide (70-mer) microarrays designed and produced by the Bovine Oligonucleotide Microarray Consortium (BOMC), USA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bovineoligo.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.bovineoligo.org/</ext-link>). The procedures followed for tissue collection, RNA isolation and microarray hybridization were as described in our earlier study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Kommadath1">[27]</xref>. Briefly, a total of 280 arrays (i.e. 14 cows×2 phases×5 tissues×2 for dye swaps) were prepared in a common reference design with the dye labels swapped between individual samples from each brain area and a reference sample consisting of equal proportions of RNA from all tissues of all cows. Microarray data pre-processing and analysis was done using the LIMMA (Linear models for microarray data) package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Smyth1">[28]</xref> within Bioconductor project <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Gentleman1">[29]</xref> of R statistical programming language (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.r-project.org</ext-link>). Briefly, background correction was performed using LIMMA's ‘normexp’ method (with an offset of 50) followed by within-array ‘print tip loess’ normalisation and between-arrays quantile normalisation (‘Aquantile’ method). We then transformed the normalized data, converting M-values back to normalised intensity values so that we could perform an intensity based analysis rather than ratio based. The final gene expression data matrix analysed here was obtained by averaging the intensities of the red and green labelled samples per individual per tissue, then averaging the median gene expression across individuals per phase, and finally averaging the expression values for genes represented by multiple probes on the array.</p>

For our analysis, we used the bovine oligonucleotide array probe re-annotation (Version 5) based on Ensembl (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ensembl.org</ext-link>) release 56 (October 2009) provided on the EADGENE website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eadgene.info/ToolsResources/EADGENEOligoSetsAnnotationFiles/tabid/324/Default.aspx" xlink:type="simple">http://www.eadgene.info/ToolsResources/EADGENEOligoSetsAnnotationFiles/tabid/324/Default.aspx</ext-link>) by the authors of the oligo-set re-annotation pipeline, sigReannot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Casel1">[30]</xref>. For the re-annotation, out of the 23,496 probes (excluding control probes) on the bovine oligonucleotide array, only 16,620 probes that were assigned a quality score between 1 and 4 for their specificity to hits on the bovine genome were considered. Probes with quality scores between 5 and 7 had either no hits or multiple hits and were not annotated as they were not specific.</p>

        <title>Identifying genomic regions of high and low gene expression</title>
        <p>Similar to the protocol followed by Nie <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Nie1">[6]</xref> for identifying regions of high and low gene expression levels, we first calculated the gene expression levels along the chromosome at the position of every gene on it using moving medians based on a window size of 39 genes i.e. the median of the expression level of that gene and that of 19 genes flanking it on either side. The Robust Scatter Plot Smoothing technique (function ‘runmed’ in R package ‘stats’) was used to calculate the moving median gene expression. The chosen window size of 39 genes falls within the range of sizes established for chromosomal domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Gierman1">[3]</xref> and is similar to the size used in earlier studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Caron1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Versteeg1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Nie1">[6]</xref>. We then defined RIDGEs and anti-RIDGEs as those regions on the chromosome that contain contiguous stretches of at least 10 gene positions where the moving median gene expression level at each gene position is a certain fold threshold higher or lower than the overall genomic median expression for the bovine transcriptome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Caron1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Versteeg1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Gierman1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Nie1">[6]</xref>. These higher and lower fold thresholds were identified by testing a range of thresholds to select the ones that resulted in the identification of RIDGEs and anti-RIDGEs to cover about 10% of the genome each. As a consequence, the gene expression fold thresholds are not symmetric. The choice of 10% coverage is arbitrary and we could have chosen other realistic genome coverage thresholds above or below this level too, provided enough genes are selected from RIDGEs and anti-RIDGEs to support the study of the genomic features for genes in these regions. Here, we chose 10% genome coverage threshold to maintain uniformity with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Nie1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Folle1">[26]</xref> and to provide a reasonable number of genes for further study. The rationale for using a genome coverage threshold, in addition to expression fold threshold, was to ensure that the total region studied is constant for both RIDGEs and anti-RIDGEs. In the absence of any prior knowledge on the presence and extent of coverage of RIDGEs and anti-RIDGEs on bovine genome and given the fact the there are several criteria that could affect the size of the RIDGEs and anti-RIDGEs, we set the genome coverage threshold to a constant value in order to make the study consistent. In addition, the criteria of genomic coverage thresholds will make the methodology used in this study scalable to any microarray platform or species.</p>

        <title>Testing the probability of finding RIDGEs and anti-RIDGEs by chance</title>
        <p>We know from studies in other species that RIDGEs and anti-RIDGEs represent a higher order structure in the genome and there is a non-random distribution or clustering of genes based on their expression levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Caron1">[1]</xref>. Here, after identifying RIDGEs and anti-RIDGEs with the criteria we defined, we tested whether the numbers of RIDGEs and anti-RIDGEs identified in bovines were indeed greater than that expected by random chance. The number of regions identified would be a function of the region size which depends on criteria we defined i.e. a combination of thresholds for gene expression level, genome coverage, window size and contiguous stretch of gene positions satisfying the gene expression threshold. Nie <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Nie1">[6]</xref> showed that with window sizes of 29, 39 and 59, the number of RIDGEs identified reduced proportionately but it was still significantly higher in the actual genome than on a randomised genome based on permutations of gene positions. Here too, we do the random permutation test to test whether, with similar settings, there would be an over-representation of regions with overall high or low gene expression on the actual genome compared to the randomised genome. In brief, the test involved permuting the genomic locations of Ensembl genes on the genome and repeating the RIDGE/anti-RIDGE analysis 10,000 times to create 10,000 random transcriptome maps and then comparing the number of RIDGEs/anti-RIDGEs thus identified to the number identified in the actual analysis.</p>

        <title>Identifying ‘Housekeeping’ and ‘Tissue-specific’ genes and their functional analysis</title>
        <p>We defined a threshold level for expression as the 99.9% quantile value of the expression levels of all negative controls on the array. Genes expressed above this level specifically in one tissue alone were defined as TS genes and those expressed in all five tissues were defined as HK genes. In order to test whether the identified TS genes and HK genes contained genes with specific functions expected of these categories, a functional analysis was done using R package ‘GOstats’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Falcon1">[31]</xref>. To take advantage of the better annotation available for human genes, we first converted the cattle genes to their orthologous human genes. Genes in the study sets were tested for enriched Gene Ontology (GO) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Ashburner1">[32]</xref> terms and KEGG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020413-Kanehisa1">[33]</xref> pathway terms.

        <title>Testing RIDGEs for over-representation of housekeeping or tissue-specific genes</title>
        <p>For testing if HK genes are over-represented on RIDGEs, we first randomly sampled the same number of genes from the total Ensembl genes on the array as the number of HK genes found in our analysis. We repeated this sampling procedure 10000 times and for each random sample, we calculated the percentage overlap of the sampled genes with the genes found to be present on the RIDGEs. We performed a similar procedure to test if TS genes are over-represented on RIDGEs. Based on these, we derived the distributions of expected percentages of HK genes and of TS genes on RIDGEs under the null hypothesis. We compared this with the actual percentage of HK genes and TS genes found on RIDGEs in our analysis.</p>
