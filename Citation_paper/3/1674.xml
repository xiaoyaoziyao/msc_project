In the first part of our study, to search for potential targets of directional selection, we developed and validated a resampling-based computational approach; we then scanned an array of 31 different-sized moving windows of SNP variants (5–65 SNPs) across the human genome in a set of European and African American population samples with 183,997 SNP loci after correcting for the recombination rate variation. The analysis revealed 180 regions of recent selection with very strong evidence in either population or both. In the second part of our study, we compared the newly discovered putative regions to those sites previously postulated in the literature, using methods based on inspecting patterns of linkage disequilibrium, population divergence and other methodologies. The newly found regions were cross-validated with those found in nine other studies that have searched for selection signals. Our study was replicated especially well in those regions confirmed by three or more studies. These validated regions were independently verified, using a combination of different methods and different databases in other studies, and should include fewer false positives. The main strength of our analysis method compared to others is that it does not require dense genotyping and therefore can be used with data from population-based genome SNP scans from smaller studies of humans or other species.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This project has been funded in whole or in part with federal funds from the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, under contract N01-CO-12400.

When a genetic variant becomes adaptive, populations experience changes in allele frequencies that reflect the strength and recurrence of the selective pressure(s). By identifying these residual footprints of genomic evolutionary processes in the form of “signatures of selection,” we hope to gain valuable insight into the evolutionary past of a species. A principal selection signature involves the local reduction in variation within the selected gene, as well as in adjacent SNP variants, around the selected chromosomal region known as “selective seep” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-MaynardSmith1">[1]</xref>. Further, when two isolated populations are examined, one of which underwent strong selection in the past but the other did not, the frequencies of the selected SNP and adjacent alleles will often be more different between the populations than expected under the assumption of neutral genetic drift <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Sabeti1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Akey1">[4]</xref>. In addition, selection affects chromosomal segments, not simply individual SNPs, thus creating complex patterns of allele frequencies in the regions immediately surrounding the targeted site. In this study, we explore patterns of reduced heterozygosity and elevated between-population allele differentiation to identify strong selection signatures in the human genome. The method can also be applied to other diploid species when light-coverage SNP allele frequency genome scans of similar magnitude become available.</p><p>To address these aspects as well as to explore a new approach, we designed and tested a strategy for revealing footprints of recent selection first by simulation and then based upon a sample of 183,993 SNP markers genotyped in 45 European Americans and 45 African Americans (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.allsnp.com" xlink:type="simple">www.allsnp.com</ext-link>). This dataset was chosen since it is independent and has never been used to estimate selection signatures. It also represents a modest database size that is smaller than the sizes of current whole-genome genotyping human population studies based on existing genotyping technologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Engle1">[5]</xref>. We used minimum information that would likely be available from such databases and searched for selective signatures by analysing three parameters observed for each SNP: 1) heterozygosity in European Americans (H<sub>EA</sub>); 2) heterozygosity in African Americans (H<sub>AA</sub>); and 3) F<sub>ST</sub> between the corresponding individual SNPs in the two populations (F<sub>ST</sub>). Centered on each available SNP, 31 arrays (or windows) including 5–65 SNPs were sampled along all human chromosomes except Y to evaluate each window for: 1) average SNP heterozygosity in European Americans (H`<sub>EA</sub>); 2) average SNP heterozygosity in African Americans (H`<sub>AA</sub>); and 3) variance of F<sub>ST</sub> among the adjacent SNPs (S<sup>2</sup>F<sub>ST</sub>). We used S<sup>2</sup>F<sub>ST</sub> instead of the F<sub>ST</sub> mean estimator from each group of adjacent SNPs, since a measure of F<sub>ST</sub> mean across an array of loci would be more sensitive to those alleles that reached fixation in the form of the opposite allele, and less sensitive for those fixed in the same direction while variance captures this alternation.</p><p>Several previous analyses of selective signatures have appeared which have been based either on decreased heterozygosity (H), population differentiation (F<sub>ST</sub>), extended linkage disequilibrium, and even the premise that certain modern hereditary disease alleles were adaptive sometime in the past <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Lewontin1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Akey1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Karl1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Vallender1">[15]</xref>. Discovered selection candidate regions included genes involved in development, immune defenses, reproduction, nutrition, behavior and other functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Bamshad1">[16]</xref>. Although several of these regions have been discovered with multiple approaches (e.g., <italic>CCR5</italic>, <italic>FY, LCT, G6PD, FOXP2</italic> and others; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001712.s001">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001712.s002">Notes S1</xref>), other provocative regions have not, raising issues around the context of different algorithms and approaches, the strength and mode of selection, the timing of imputed selective events, the influence of study design, and the validity of unreplicated regions. To test the validity of our approach, the results of our scan was applied to previously nominated regions to explore how well this method validated previous discoveries.</p><p>Finally, we incorporated nine other genome-wide or chromosome-wide attempts to find signatures of selection that included whole-genome searches for signatures of selection either by searching for the high values of local genomic divergence alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Akey1">[4]</xref> or in combination with the allelic frequency spectrum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Frazer1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Altshuler1">[18]</xref>, looking for gene neighborhoods exhibiting extended linkage disequilibrium alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Huttley1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Voight1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Wang1">[20]</xref> or in combination with local genomic divergence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Sabeti3">[21]</xref>, or by examining an aberrant frequency spectrum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Carlson1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Nielsen1">[23]</xref>.

The strategy for selection detection involved the following six steps (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001712-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>): 1) regional levels of heterozygosity (H`) and population divergence (S<sup>2</sup>F<sub>ST</sub>) were estimated by choosing adjacent SNPs at the beginning of a single chromosome and computing H`<sub>EA</sub>, H`<sub>AA</sub> and S<sup>2</sup>F<sub>ST </sub>for each SNP in the two populations. 2) The SNP window was moved one SNP to the right and the same parameters were computed, and then again for the next group of five SNPs, until the results for 10,864 groups (for chromosome 1, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001712.s003">Table S2</xref>) were determined. 3) The same computation but using windows of 7, 9, 11 … 65 SNPs (i.e., a total of 31 SNP window sizes from 5 to 65 SNPs in length), was assessed across each chromosome. A baseline distribution to which these estimates are compared, was developed by choosing five (then 7, 9, 11 ... 65) random SNPs sampled 100,000 times across each chromosome. We analyzed odd numbers to center the sampling window on a SNP. The upper window size was dictated by limits in computational capabilities. 4) A distribution of empirical values was obtained and fractionally ranked relative to the randomly sampled expectations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001712-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This process was then repeated 100 times to reach a total 10 million values. By combining these values, a chromosome-wide distribution of the mean fractional ranks (0&lt;r&lt;1) of given values (H`<sub>EA</sub>, H`<sub>AA</sub>, or S<sup>2</sup>F<sub>ST</sub>) for each of the 31 SNP array replicates (of increasing SNP window size) was assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001712-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). 5) For each SNP, the lowest fractional rank mean value (λ) was chosen among the 31 windows reflecting the size of the region with the largest deviation from expectations (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). The distribution of λ values across each chromosome provides a quantitative indication of the departure from the random expectation and is plotted across the length of each chromosome versus cM position of each SNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001712-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0001712-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001712.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>A flow chart for analyzing regions for local heterozygosity in African Americans (H`<sub>AA</sub>) and European Americans (H`<sub>EA</sub>), along with the variance of F<sub>ST</sub> (S<sup>2</sup>F<sub>ST</sub>) to derive the lowest mean value fractional rank (λ) for each SNP.</title><p>(A) Sampling and resampling process: (Top) We selected five adjacent SNPs at the beginning of a single chromosome and computed H`<sub>EA</sub>, H`<sub>AA</sub> and S<sup>2</sup>F<sub>ST </sub>for the group, then moved the window sequentially to the right, one SNP at a time (observed values).

The same computation was done for all 31 SNP window group sizes (N = 5, 7, 9 … 65) 100 times, and mean values were calculated. For each SNP, the lowest mean value (λ) for H`<sub>EA</sub> was chosen from the 31 windows of size 5 to 65, and plotted across the length of each chromosome in cM.

If one population experienced selection at a mutant locus that arose in the ancestral population, a partial sweep represents the kind of selection we are interested in detecting. The assumptions we made were that neutral variation was present in the ancestral population before the selected mutation, and that the loci in the selected population carries a portion of the ancestral variation. We imitated genome-wide average mutation rate, the same population size as in our present study (24 individuals in each population), and a marker density to be close to that in our experimental dataset: one marker for each 10 kb. In turn, we varied selection strength, and intensity of recombination (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). Values of λ were then calculated for the control and the selected population. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001712-g003">Figure 3</xref>, we summarize maximum λ values calculated for 100 replicate “chromosomes” in four different parameter combinations, alternating high (s = 0.03) and low (s = 0.003) selection coefficient versus high (r = 0.6) and low (r = 0.3) recombination rate. The choice of selection coefficients in the SelSim simulations was based on previously reported estimates. For example, selection coefficient for the lactase-persistence allele was predicted to be between 0.014 and 0.15 in CEPH, and between 0.09 and 0.19 in the Scandinavian population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Bersaglieri1">[25]</xref>. Furthermore, the selection coefficient has been set between 0.02 and 0.05 for <italic>G6PD</italic> deficiency which gives advantage to survival in the malarial regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Tishkoff2">[26]</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0001712-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001712.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>SelSim simulation results summarizing the effect of selection on the estimates of (A) λ(H`<sub>D</sub>) and (B) λ(S<sup>2</sup>F<sub>ST</sub>) among 100 replicate of 2.61 Mb simulated chromosomes of chromosomes for each of the four parameter combination with varying selection coefficient and recombination rate.</title><p>These simulations were performed using SelSim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Spencer1">[24]</xref>, assuming equal sampling (48 chromosomes) and a complete separation between the two populations.

Coincidentally, strong recombination acts to break up long-range haplotypes which results in narrower signal. Overall, variance of F<sub>ST</sub> across loci (S<sup>2</sup>F<sub>ST</sub>) yields more noteworthy λ values than those based on heterozygosity, and the location of the identified selected site was only 0.001 Mb for λ(S<sup>2</sup>F<sub>ST</sub>) and 0.005 Mb away for λ(H`<sub>D</sub>) away from the target site on average. The overall less notable values of λ resulted from many fewer sites simulated on a single chromosome (261) rather than in our genome-wide scan (183,993). Reassuringly, a chromosome simulated under the neutral conditions (s = 0) does not demonstrate a characteristic pattern in heterozygosity or S<sup>2</sup>F<sub>ST</sub> that indicates a selective sweep (not shown) but matches noise present beyond the selection sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001712-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Evaluation of candidate regions</title><p>When a selective sweep occurs in the chromosomal region around a target gene in two populations that have recently separated, it produces signatures in more than one of the three estimates evaluated. Therefore, the interpretation of the derived data was based upon certain theoretical predictions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001712-t001">Table 1</xref>) validated by simulations (above). First, consider an “old” selection event that occurred prior to differentiation of modern European and African populations. Under this scenario, H`<sub>EA</sub> and H`<sub>AA</sub> are diminished but S<sup>2</sup>F<sub>ST</sub> is diminished somewhat or remains at baseline expectations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001712-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001712-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). For a “recent” selection event in one, but not the other population, the selected region displays lower H` values for that population and higher S<sup>2</sup>F<sub>ST</sub> as different alleles approach fixation in the two populations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001712-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001712-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Thus, S<sup>2</sup>F<sub>ST</sub> uniquely captures alterations of high and low F<sub>ST</sub> values expected in the area of the selective sweep. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001712-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, three chromosomal regions (containing <italic>CCR5</italic>, <italic>FOXP2</italic> and <italic>IL4</italic>) illustrate these effects. An “old” selection event (lower levels of heterozygosity in two populations) likely occurred in the region that included <italic>CCR5</italic> (and several other chemokine receptors, notably <italic>CCR1</italic>) and <italic>FOXP2</italic>, while the <italic>IL4</italic> region has both decreased heterozygosity and increased S<sup>2</sup>F<sub>ST</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001712-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The region of increased homozygosity is broad in African Americans (implying a recent selection event) but narrow in Europeans (perhaps indicating an older selective event, reduced in size by more generations of recombination).

Some regions of the genome are devoid of any evidence of historic selection (0–50 cM of chromosomes 2 and 10), while others have multiple sites of selection (25–75 cM of chromosome 1; 55–90 cM chromosome 3). We expected old selection sites to be relatively smaller than the new ones, due to the long-term effects of recombination. Indeed, older sites were 77 Kb on average (95% C.I. = 4–831 Kb), almost 60% smaller than the recent sites (147 Kb, 95% C.I. = 6–1,349 Kb) (GLM, d.f. = 1, F = 5.59, = 2.364, p = 0.019). A comparison based on the cM distance yielded similar results (p = 0.001). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001712-g004">Figure 4A</xref> shows a full scan for chromosome 2 where sites of selection in European Americans only, selection in African Americans only, “old” selection in both populations, and “new” selection in both populations (analogous to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001712-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) are indicated by different symbols. Similarly, a complete scan of all the autosomes and chromosome X in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001712-g005">Figure 5</xref> displays locations of the overlapping peaks (designated by letters) indicating the putative selection sites (designated by symbols).</p><p>The human genome also has large variations in diversity on a micro and macro chromosomal scale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Altshuler1">[18]</xref>, and recombination “hot spots” are an important source shaping linked genetic variation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Altshuler1">[18]</xref>. However, recent work has shown that most of the effect of recombination on diversity is on a relatively small scale (2–4 Kb, around the size of recombination hotspots) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Frazer1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Spencer2">[27]</xref>. Still, we accounted for linkage disequilibrium (LD) by using recombination-based distances (cM) interpolated from localized curvilinear regressions using deCODE genetic distances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Kong1">[28]</xref>. Since our study examined the distribution of allelic frequencies on a larger scale (markers were spaced about every 10 Kb in genes) and the regions found are much larger (average size = 107 Kb, 95% C.I. = 5–977, from a lognormal distribution), recombination cold spots are unlikely to explain the regions we have discovered. In our own simulation study, higher recombination rates result in a narrower footprint of selection (see: Identifying a selection target in a simulated dataset).</p><p>Indeed, simulation studies have been undertaken to test specificity and sensitivity of empirical approaches to detect signatures of recent selection from genome-wide polymorphism data similar to that in our study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Teshima1">[29]</xref>. Analysis of these models indicated the possibility of discovery of some candidate genes, especially those subject to high selection pressures. At the same time, it is likely that empirical approaches could miss large numbers of loci, especially those displaying small to moderate selection effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Teshima1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Kelley1">[30]</xref>. Additionally, strong confounding effects of demographic history complicate deduction of selection sites, especially when a small number of loci are studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Kelley1">[30]</xref>. However, these effects affect all loci in the genome indiscriminately, while natural selection is locus-specific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Lewontin1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-CavalliSforza1">[31]</xref>. Consequently, while sampling large genomic SNP databases, empirical distributions can be constructed and genes subjected to the local forces, such as selection, as opposed to the genome-wide forces, like demography, which can be identified by the outlier approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Kelley1">[30]</xref>, including the one used in our study and others (e.g. Voight et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Voight1">[19]</xref>, and Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Wang1">[20]</xref>). Finally, ascertainment bias is omnipresent in large-scale polymorphism studies because SNPs are routinely discovered on a limited number of chromosomes before being genotyped in a population study suitable for a selection scan. Ongoing efforts aim to avoid or minimize ascertainment bias, so hopefully, future datasets constructed for local human populations or other species will be less biased. Analyses of those datasets with modest ascertainment bias can dependably infer selected regions, resulting in an enhanced set of genes targeted by positive selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Kelley1">[30]</xref>. In addition, results from these scans, including ours, can be further validated. While many studies considered one statistic at a time, some of the recent studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Frazer1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Sabeti3">[21]</xref> considered looking at combinations of different approaches. While it is not obvious how to rank the input of each statistic, combinatorial approaches may be instrumental in decreasing error rates. This is why in our study, we first looked at different statistics according to our own expectation model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001712-t001">Table 1</xref>) and then compared coordinates of our putative regions to the coordinates of the regions found in other selection scans, hoping that they would provide us with further independent validation of these findings.</p><p>The identified regions and their interpretation are subject to important limitations. First, the power of our analysis is limited by the number of samples used (45 for each population) and the number of loci examined. Increased sample sizes would have resulted in better estimates, especially for the variance of population differentiation (S<sup>2</sup>F<sub>ST</sub>). Second, African American samples came from populations that are known to be admixed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Parra1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Smith1">[33]</xref>. Using a discrete, non-mixed African population might have implicated more and different regions or missed others. Third, the choice of the SNPs was not random, but rather comprises a source of commercially available TaqMan® assays for variable SNPs targeted for disease gene discovery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-DeLaVega1">[34]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). However, we expected that favored alleles would generally be located within extended and shared haplotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Sabeti2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Spencer2">[27]</xref> that encompass larger regions, partially compensating for the gene-centric limitations of the dataset. Finally, our dataset is smaller than several other human ones. However, a strength of our study is its analysis of an independent dataset, especially since the recent literature largely focuses on either HapMap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Sabeti1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Frazer1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Voight1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Sabeti3">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Nielsen1">[23]</xref> or Perlegen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Wang1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Carlson1">[22]</xref> data in a series of overlapping studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Sabeti1">[2]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>A synthesis of scans for selection across the genome</title><p>Including this one, ten studies have scanned the human genome for regions of selective sweeps to date, with varying levels of success by utilizing extended linkage disequilibrium, elevated divergence and reduced homozygosity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Akey1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Huttley1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Frazer1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Nielsen1">[23]</xref>.

As a result, we would expect that many of the sites would be cross-validated by these studies, but these comparisons are simply not independent. One way to look past the correlation between non-independent studies is to count those regions cross-validated by three or more studies. Among these, 23 (26%) selected regions are validated by three or more methods on chromosome 2. As an independent approach with a different set of data, our study cross-validated very well: 6 out of 10 studies (60%) were still on the list, while other studies with more than 5 sites originally replicated by other studies had smaller fractions validated in this fashion: to 42% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Frazer1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Nielsen1">[23]</xref>, and 34% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Voight1">[19]</xref>.

Since Nielsen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Nielsen1">[23]</xref> only evaluated one chromosome, we would expect successful cross-validation of many of the 180 sites we found throughout the rest of the genome, but would require similar (ongoing) comprehensive scans. Considering the genome as a whole and some limitations of these studies, extrapolation of our success on chromosome 2 genome-wide would suggest that many hundreds of sites will show multiple lines of evidence of selective sweeps. Note that we report exclusive coordinates for the validated regions. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001712-g002">Figure 2</xref>, our overlapping regions 2.16 and 2.18 included two regions from this study (2b and 2c) that are encompassed by a combined region formed by an overlap of sites reported in Huttley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Huttley1">[9]</xref> and Sabeti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Sabeti3">[21]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001712.s005">Table S4</xref>), while the same 3Mb-long extensive site reported in Huttley at al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Huttley1">[9]</xref> is replicated by five different studies, and results is listed in eight exclusive validated overlapping regions (2.15–2.22)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001712.s005">Table S4</xref>). Also on chromosome 2, two other cross-verified regions that were not seen in our scan but by the overlapping results of two other studies (peaks 2.1 [43.89–48.25 cM] and 2.6 [121.08–121.81 cM]) show peaks in one of our three tests (connected by a dotted line on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001712-g002">Figure 2B</xref>); however, their values lie below our detection thresholds. There is also an indication of a peak on chromosome 2 that corresponds to a cluster of regions at 108.35–109.12 Mb (121.08–121.81 cM). Similar low level peaks are sometimes evident at additional regions validated by other studies, but were not significant in our scan (not shown).</p><p>Across the whole genome, a total of 356 regions were validated by at least two of the ten studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001712-g007">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001712-g008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001712.s004">Table S3</xref>, and Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001712.s009">References S1</xref>). The study by Voight et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Voight1">[19]</xref> has the most validated regions (180 of 356). These, however, include 122 sites overlapped by 73 sites from another study that used the same algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Frazer1">[17]</xref>. Voight et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Voight1">[19]</xref> also has a relatively high number of locations reported (750), compared to all the others (10–180). Regions in our analysis are reported by other studies 47 times, while other studies are individually cross-validated in from 14 to 34 regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001712-g007">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001712-g008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001712.s005">Table S4</xref>). These cross-validated, or “golden” regions are particularly interesting since they were independently verified using a combination of different methods and different databases, and are probably less likely to include false positives.</p><p>Our analysis targeted sites surrounded by a local decrease in genetic variation and alternations of allele frequencies between the two populations examined, or so-called “selective sweeps.” These patterns are caused primarily by positive selection, so our scan missed other types of selection. Drift, bottlenecks, and recombination could also have created effects similar to those produced by selective sweeps. For example, low heterozygosity in Europeans could be accounted for by the bottleneck of the out-of-Africa dispersal event <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-CavalliSforza2">[35]</xref>. We adjusted our λ cutoffs genome-wide for each of λ(H`<sub>AA</sub>) and λ(H`<sub>EA</sub>) and λ(S<sup>2</sup>F<sub>ST</sub>) when identifying peaks with more stringent criteria for European American heterozygosity (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). In addition, regions were identified as selected when at least two estimates showed unusually low λ, partially accounting for the demographic events in specific populations.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>The future of scanning genomes for selection</title><p>In addition and perhaps most importantly, the present study captures the signals of LD but does not require a family-based HapMap strategy and its large investment cost to capture signals of LD, and does not require the estimation of the ancestral allele state. A smaller scan can be applied to search for selection by comparing populations adapted to different local environments or disease, while using current chip-based genotyping technologies where the costs are several orders of magnitude lower. In addition, genome studies that focus on species other than our own will only be available at high density some time in the future. Certainly, genomes of some model organisms like <italic>Drosophila</italic> will be studied very closely, and densely genotyped on a scale comparable to humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Begun1">[36]</xref>. However, this will not be the case for many other diploid animals or plants, including those attracting significant scientific interest because of their conservation status or usefulness. Currently, genotyping technologies are capable of processing 100,000–1,000,000 SNP assays in custom scans, and obtaining frequency estimates on a scale that yields datasets similar to the one we examined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Dove1">[37]</xref>. Therefore, our analysis method will be applicable to the studies of selection in the populations of mammalian species nominated by NHGRI for whole genome sequence at 7x coverage, and where SNP collections are assembled (e.g., chimp, dog, elephant, armadillo, cat, horse, cow, rabbit, etc.). Generally, dense genotyping will not be available on the scale currently only available in humans for most species anytime soon.</p><p>We are still developing an understanding of the shifting adaptive landscapes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Wright1">[38]</xref> and forces that act on populations and alter individual genomes. There are irregular patterns of variation, other than natural selection, that can arise under the influence of the evolutionary forces. Harboring an unusual pattern of variation compared to the rest of the genome (or chromosome) is not a guarantee that the locus is selected, and vice versa. However, it is likely that genomic regions containing selected loci have unusual patterns of genetic variation. Using different methodologies and different datasets may help us to better understand these phenomena. Many of the effects of selection are likely more subtle than those we identified. Thus, the criteria and indices used for the purpose of this investigation are by no means exclusive or necessarily optimal. For example, while heterozygosity is a universal indicator of genetic variation, central allele frequency changes (∼0.35–0.65) yield little signal. Our focus on those sites approaching fixation likely found older and more complete selection events.</p><p>One of the main challenges in the genetics field is the identification of functional relevance genome-wide. Determining genomic regions with signatures of recent selection has application to the discovery of new disease genes and other human phenotypes. Incorporating allele frequency and population differentiation approaches with haplotype-based methods should prove to be a powerful tool in genome-wide identification of selected regions. Evaluation of various approaches and datasets in identifying selected regions is particularly important, because it provides an independent verification of regions found by a combination of different methodologies and databases. Understanding of imprints of historic selection/adaptation episodes written in genomes of humans and other species offers modest promise in interpreting modern and ancestral gene origins and modifications.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>SNP genotypes</title><p>A total of 183,997 SNPs were identified from the TaqMan® Validated SNP Genotyping Assays (formerly known as the TaqMan® Assays-on-Demand SNP Genotyping products) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-DeLaVega1">[34]</xref>. An initial collection of over 4 million SNPs was narrowed down by selecting high-quality candidate SNPs, aiming for a gene-centric picket fence of 10 kb spacing.

The distribution of heterozygosity was skewed towards the larger values in both populations as expected because SNPs were intentionally selected for genotyping with a minor allele frequency (MAF) &gt;0.05 or other strong evidence of their polymorphic status. Most loci were highly polymorphic; 68.53% of loci in African Americans and 63.79% of loci in European Americans had H&gt;45%, while only in 6.83% of loci in African Americans and 8.55% of all loci the levels of heterozygosity were below 5%. At the same time, overall average heterozygosity is higher in European Americans (0.34) than in African Americans (0.33). Chromosome X shows the highest levels of F<sub>ST</sub> (0.201) and is almost twice as differentiated as the autosomes (0.125). There was a significant difference in the distribution of H<sub>AA</sub>, H<sub>EA</sub>, or F<sub>ST</sub> among the chromosomes overall, as well as among the autosomes in an analysis of variance (p&lt;0.0001, Proc GLM, SAS 9.1). While some of this significance can be attributed to the known ascertainment bias, the difference remains significant when accounting for the density of the SNPs assayed on different chromosomes (p&lt;0.0001).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Genome scan for selection, analytic methods</title><p>A database of allelic frequencies, number of samples genotyped, and the physical positions for each of 183,997 SNPs from European (n = 45) and African Americans (n = 45) developed by Applied Biosystems was evaluated.

These simulations were performed using SelSim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Spencer1">[24]</xref>, assuming equal sampling (48 chromosomes) and a complete separation between the two populations. Values of λ were calculated for the control or ancestral, and the selected or derived population. We calculated maximum λ values for 100 replicate “chromosomes” by the same resampling-based algorithm in four different parameter combinations, alternating high and low selection coefficients versus high and low recombination rates. Selection parameter (s) ranged from neutral to 0.3% to 3% and recombination intensity per site (r) from 0.3 to 0.6, assuming an 10,000 effective population size for each population (maximum allowed by the program).</p><p>The simulation scheme emulates one previously utilized to model population substructure of dog breeds where Pollinger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001712-Pollinger1">[43]</xref> showed significant heterozygosity and F<sub>ST</sub> effects after a selective sweep.

The exact strength and the extent of the selection signatures under different conditions are beyond the scope of the SelSim program and this report. In the simulation presently employed, 48 chromosomes carried the selected mutation (derived) and 48 chromosomes did not (ancestral), approximating the numbers of individuals we examined in each population. If one of the populations was recently separated from the other and selection acted on a mutation that arose in an ancestral population, the partial selective sweep is an approximation of the true process with the assumption that most of the neutral variation appeared before the introduction of the selected mutation. Therefore, the set of haplotypes that carry the selected mutation contains a subsample of neutral variation in the ancestral population, and can be contrasted with the set carrying the ancestral allele.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Scanning the genome for selected regions</title><p>Each chromosome was sampled 100,000 times and fractional ranks, ranging from 0 to 1, determined for the sliding windows (described above; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001712-g001">Figure 1B, C</xref>).
