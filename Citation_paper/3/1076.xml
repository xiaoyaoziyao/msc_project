<abstract>
<p>In their post-traumatic course, trauma patients suffering from multiple injuries have a high risk for immune dysregulation, which may contribute to post-injury complications and late mortality. Monocytes as specific effector cells of the innate immunity play a crucial role in inflammation. Using their Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs), notably Toll-Like Receptors (TLR), the monocytes recognize pathogens and/or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and organize their clearance. TLR2 is the major receptor for particles of gram-positive bacteria, and initiates their phagocytosis. Here, we investigated the phagocytizing capability of monocytes in a long-term porcine severe trauma model (polytrauma, PT) with regard to their TLR2 expression. Polytrauma consisted of femur fracture, unilateral lung contusion, liver laceration, hemorrhagic shock with subsequent resuscitation and surgical fracture fixation. After induction of PT, peripheral blood was withdrawn before (-1 h) and directly after trauma (0 h), as well as 3.5 h, 5.5 h, 24 h and 72 h later. CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes were identified and the expression levels of H(S)LA-DR and TLR2 were investigated by flow cytometry. Additionally, the phagocytizing activity of monocytes by applying <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> particles labelled with pHrodo fluorescent reagent was also assessed by flow cytometry. Furthermore, blood samples from 10 healthy pigs were exposed to a TLR2-neutralizing antibody and subsequently <italic>to S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> particles. Using flow cytometry, phagocytizing activity was determined. P below 0.05 was considered significant. The number of CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes of all circulating leukocytes remained constant during the observational time period, while the percentage of CD14<sup>+</sup>H(S)LA-DR<sup>+</sup> monocytes significantly decreased directly, 3.5 h and 5.5 h after trauma. The percentage of TLR2<sup>+</sup> expressing cells out of all monocytes significantly decreased directly, 3.5 h and 5.5 h after trauma. The percentage of phagocytizing monocytes decreased immediately and remained lower during the first 3.5 h after trauma, but increased after 24 h. Antagonizing TLR2 significantly decreased the phagocytizing activity of monocytes. Both, decreased percentage of activated as well as TLR2 expressing monocytes persisted as long as the reduced phagocytosis was observed. Moreover, neutralizing TLR2 led to a reduced capability of phagocytosis as well. Therefore, we assume that reduced TLR2 expression may be responsible for the decreased phagocytizing capacity of circulating monocytes in the early post-traumatic phase.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Traumatically induced tissue damage leads to an inflammatory response. Inflammation itself is not detrimental but rather necessary for the resolution of injury and the healing progress. This complex process integrates and coordinates cytokines, chemokines and immune cells to deal with the damage.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref002">2</xref>] One attempt to characterize this inflammatory reaction was the concept of a trauma-induced hyper-inflammatory systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and the counterbalancing hypo-inflammatory state (compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome, CARS) in the later clinical course.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref003">3</xref>] The balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory components, the SIRS-CARS paradigm, was assumed to be crucial for a successful recovery and a positive outcome.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref005">5</xref>] However, the classification terms of SIRS and CARS are more than 20 years old, and are only of limited usefulness to describe the patient’s current immune status because they do not always correlate well with immunofunctional parameters. Moreover, the injured tissue releases a large number of soluble factors that act on the endocrine, lymphoid and haematopoietic organs as well.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref002">2</xref>]</p>
<p>Monocytes play a crucial role in the early immune response after trauma and infection. On one hand they constitute a cellular link between the innate and the adaptive immune system in case of infection, and on the other hand, are capable of recognizing pathogens or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) directed by their pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), and subsequently inactivate invading pathogens by phagocytosis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref008">8</xref>] The impact of trauma onto the function of monocytes is still not clear and can be conflicting. Anupamaa Seshadri <italic>et al</italic>.

<p>An important subset of PRRs are Toll-like Receptors (TLRs), of which there are 10 known types in humans.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref013">13</xref>] TLR2 is the major receptor for bacterial lipoproteins, lipopeptides and lipoteichoic acid (LTA), which are common for gram-positive bacteria.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref014">14</xref>] <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> is the most common gram-positive bacterium, which causes nosocomial infections like pneumonia and sepsis, and is therefore highly associated with increased morbidity and mortality in chronically ill patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref017">17</xref>] Furthermore, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> is feared for its potential to infect wounds and enter the bloodstream after trauma or surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref019">19</xref>] Phagocytosis seems to be initiated by the activation of PRRs, and in particular TLRs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref020">20</xref>] Several studies show an impaired phagocytic capability of monocytes in the post-traumatic course as described below.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref022">22</xref>] The data is inconsistent regarding TLR2 expression on monocytes after trauma.

(2003) reported a constant TLR2 expression on monocytes in trauma patients at admission compared to healthy volunteers.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref023">23</xref>] Other studies have shown an impaired expression of TLR2 in trauma patients during the first 48 hours or over a time course of 10 days after trauma compared to healthy volunteers.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref024">24</xref>]</p>
<p>Expression of the antigen presenting human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules, the cell surface proteins human major histocompatibility complex MHC-II, has been known for a long time and is well described on human monocytes from healthy volunteers.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref026">26</xref>] However, early after hemorrhagic shock or severe abdominal surgery, an impaired MHC-II expression on macrophages and specifically on monocytes has been reported.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref028">28</xref>] With regard to trauma, a decreased MHC-II expression in human monocytes after trauma has been reported.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref029">29</xref>] Nonetheless, the expression profile of H(S)LAs, the porcine MHC molecules, still remains not fully discovered, and even less is known about their behavior after trauma. MHC-I and MHC-II molecules were first observed on monocytes in pigs by Chamorro <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref030">30</xref>] Raymond <italic>et al</italic>.

<p>To summarize, there are alterations in TLR2 and MHC-II expression, as well as modulations in phagocytizing behavior of monocytes after severe trauma, and the discrepancy between the results in previous studies is tremendous. And still, mechanisms are not discovered yet, and even less is known with regard to the experimental polytrauma model in a large animal. The varied findings in the mentioned studies above could be due to the uncontrollable nature of trauma and its complications. Several studies only ackowledged one time point in the clinical course (e.g. admission or in the first 48 hours after admission). Furthermore, there are very few studies that combine phenotyping of immune cells with their physiological function after trauma. Therefore, in our experiment, the expression of MHC-II (SLA-DR) and TLR2 on circulating monocytes were measured in a time course of 72 hours after severe trauma in a controlled porcine long term polytrauma model. In parallel, the phagocytizing capacity of the monocytes was evaluated as one of their physiological function. Furthermore, the direct association of TLR2 with phagocytosis was analyzed. In this prospective study, we hypothesized we would observe similar results in the individual parts of the study as in previous human trauma studies with two goals: first to establish the porcine polytrauma model as a way to further investigate patients’ post-traumatic physiology immune response, and second to associate our individual parts of the study to get more knowledge about mechanistics behind post-traumatic immune (dys-) regulation.</p>

During the study period over 72 h, anesthesia and analgesia was continuously maintained with intravenous (IV) injection of Propofol and Sufentanil at a sufficient level to prevent any periods of pain or consciousness. The animals were not awakened at any time point after the induction of polytrauma. The animals were ventilated on volume control mode (Draeger, Evita, Lübeck, Germany) with room air at a tidal volume setting of 6–8 ml/kg, positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 mmHg (plateau pressure &lt; 28 mmHg), and pCO<sub>2</sub> of 35–45 mm Hg as previously described.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref034">34</xref>] Catheters were aseptically inserted in multiple locations: the external jugular vein for administration of fluids, anesthesia and continuous monitoring of central venous pressure (CVP, central venous catheter 4-Lumen Catheter, 8.5 Fr., ArrowCatheter, Teleflex Medical, Germany), the right femoral vein to induce hemorrhage (3-Lumen hemodialysis, 12.0 Fr., ArrowCatheter, Teleflex Medical, Germany) and into the femoral artery for continuous blood pressure monitoring (4.0 Fr. arterial line catheter, Vygon, Germany).

<title>Induction of polytrauma</title>
<p>The polytrauma was induced as previously described.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref034">34</xref>] In brief, antibiotic prophylaxis (Ceftriaxon® 2 g) was administered before surgery and after every 24 h until sacrifice. Prior to initial trauma induction, the fraction of inspired O<sub>2</sub> (FiO<sub>2</sub>) was set at 0.21 and the fluid administration was reduced to 10 ml/h. At this phase, the animals were allowed to descend into a hypothermic state following hemorrhagic shock period mimicking the pre-clinical scenario. The animal was positioned on the right side and a femur fracture was induced with a bolt shot on the right hind leg (Blitz-Kerner, turbocut JOBB GmbH, Germany, 9x17, Dynamit Nobel AG, Troisdorf, Germany). After being placed back in the dorsal position, blunt thoracic trauma with a bolt shot on the right dorsal lower thorax was induced. Finally, a midline-laparotomy and uncontrolled bleeding for 30 seconds after crosswise incision of the caudal liver lobe (4.5 x 4.5 cm) was induced. Using sterile gauze-compresses the liver was packed. Pressure-controlled haemorrhagic shock using exsanguination from right femoral artery was performed until a mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) of 40 ± 5 mm Hg was reached and maintained for 90 minutes.</p>

<p>Monocytes play a pivotal role in inflammation and show massive functional modulations in trauma patients e.g. in phagocytosis, their maturation and TLR expression or impaired cytokine secretion after <italic>ex vivo</italic> stimulation with endotoxin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref039">39</xref>] Several clinical studies and experimental in vivo studies in small animals have shown an altered surface expression of TLR and HLA-DR as well as an impaired phagocytic activity after severe trauma. Despite numerous studies in the last decades, the importance of functional modulations of monocytes after trauma is still not fully understood.</p>

Furthermore, we could show that the blood level of circulating CD14 positive monocytes does not change significantly over a time course of 72 hours after trauma in a porcine model.</p>
<p>In general, little is known about the expression of H(S)LA, the porcine MHC molecules on monocytes. Chamorro <italic>et al</italic>. (2004) discovered SLA-I, SLA-II-DQ and SLA-II-DR molecules on porcine monocytes, and Raymond <italic>et al</italic>. (2005) observed the expression of MHC-II on porcine monocytes and their increase after treatment with both lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or lipoteichoic acid (LTA) by using flow cytometry.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref031">31</xref>] Further analyses have shown that porcine SLA-1*0401 and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I HLA-A*0101 can present the same peptides, but in different conformations, demonstrating cross-species epitope presentation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref041">41</xref>] This is so far important, as it has been verified before that human anti-HLA-DR recognizes porcine leukocyte antigens. With regard to the relevance of its expression, Monneret <italic>et al</italic>. (2006) could correlate the persisting lower expression of MHC-II molecules on human monocytes in patients suffering infections who had increased mortality rates, while survivors have shown an increasing MHC-II expression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref042">42</xref>] The authors concluded that the expression of MHC-II may constitute a highly potent marker for the outcome.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref042">42</xref>] Regarding trauma, a significantly decreased expression of MHC-II molecules on human monocytes was reported, however, this phenomenon did not correlate with post-injury infections.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref029">29</xref>]. In line with those studies, our study shows the post-traumatic maturation of porcine monocytes was investigated for the first time. We could demonstrate a decreased MHC-II expression on porcine monocytes in the early post-traumatic course with a recovery phase after 24 hours. Due to the limited experimental design with regard to the duration of the observational period, we did not evaluate the clinical course, and therefore, we are unable to make a statement regarding the influence of the observed decrease in H(S)LA-DR positive monocytes on the possibly emerging complications in our model. Nonetheless, our findings confirm the data from trauma patients, and indicate at a lower stage of maturation of monocytes with subsequently impaired function after trauma. The relevance of this findings remains to be evaluated in further studies.</p>
<p>The activation of monocytes is triggered <italic>via</italic> TLRs. Thus, despite their maturation as described above, considering functional alterations of monocytes after trauma, it seems reasonable to analyze the TLR expression on monocytes after trauma. The genes of 10 porcine TLRs (TLR1-10) are described and listed in the public nucleotide database. So far, however, little is known about their expression on porcine monocytes and little with regard to porcine severe trauma. Liu <italic>et al</italic>. (2009) demonstrated the gene expression for TLR2, 3, 4, 7, 8 and 9, and have shown a significant upregulation <italic>ex vivo in vitro</italic> for TLR2, 4 and 8, after infection in porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref043">43</xref>] Interestingly, in surgical trauma patients increased TLR2 in comparison to the control group was reported.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref044">44</xref>] Lendemans <italic>et al</italic>. (2007), however, have shown a significantly downregulated expression of TLR2 receptor on monocytes within the first 48 hours after severe trauma in patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref024">24</xref>] This is in line with data reported here, confirming the early decrease in TLR2 expressing monocytes immediately after trauma, indicating that the porcine trauma model represents the changes in TLR2 expressing monocytes, which were observed in trauma patients.</p>
<p>In general, nothing is known about the post-traumatic behavior of porcine monocytes so far and also their phagocytic activity after trauma was investigated for the first time in a porcine trauma model. The expression of TLR2 on CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes was decreased simultaneously with the phagocytic activity, in particular directly after surgery, 3.5 and 5.5 hours after trauma. Subsequently, these findings led us to the hypothesis that the impaired TLR2 expression on monocytes is associated with their reduced phagocytic activity of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> particles in the early post-traumatic course. Previous publications already suggested the dependence of phagocytosis on PRRs and supported our hypothesis. Attempts to correlate the TLR2 expression with the diminished immune activity on monocytes, such as phagocytosis after severe trauma are limited. Sturm <italic>et al</italic>. (2017) have shown a decreased phagocytic activity of human monocytes in the first two days after severe trauma, with a recovery beginning at post-injury day 3.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref022">22</xref>] Data from this study confirm the early diminished phagocytosis, which was observed in patients after trauma as well. There is, however, apparently a faster recovery in porcine monocytes as compared to human samples after trauma. Freeman and Grinstein (2014) addressed the association of TLRs to the phagocytic activity before.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref020">20</xref>] In brief, TLR activation leads to a so called inside-out activation, increasing the mobility of phagocytic receptors on the cell surface/cell membrane, thereby facilitating the engulfment of particles/pathogens.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref020">20</xref>] In another <italic>in vitro</italic> model, it has been demonstrated that specific phagocytosis probably involved recognition of cell wall components that requires participation of a TLR2-dependent pathway.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref046">46</xref>] Human peripheral blood monocytes, treated with the TLR2 agonist have shown significantly enhanced phagocytic ability <italic>in vitro</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref047">47</xref>] Consistently, our results have shown as well that early diminished TLR2 expression in porcine monocytes was associated with a simultaneously decreased phagocytizing activity after trauma. To define the role of TLR2 in the phagocytosis response of monocytes against <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>, we investigated the phagocytosis in TLR2-neutralized monocytes obtained from healthy pigs. We could confirm our hypothesis, TLR2 neutralization reduced the phagocytizing rate. Taken together, our data suggest that the decrease of the ratio of TLR2 positive monocytes after trauma may be responsible for the decrease in monocyte phagocytosis, which we have observed in the present study. Combined with results of previous publications, we assume that TLR2 might probably mediate the phagocytizing capability of monocytes for certain bacterial particles in the porcine polytrauma model.</p>
<p>Despite new insights in the porcine cellular physiology, our study has several limitations. First, the very low phagocytizing capacity of the cells may possibly be caused by the use of EDTA and not heparin blood for the assay. Furthermore, it remains to be elucidated, if the early phagocytosis-depression of monocytes will influence the outcome after trauma. Due to the limited observational period (72 hours), our findings cannot be linked to defined outcomes like infections, sepsis, length of stay on ICU or requirement for ventilation which occur way after 72h. Several studies suggest intracellular processes as reason for an impaired post-traumatic function of monocytes. There are different mechanisms of TLR regulation, which have not been addressed here, such as localization and trafficking between the Golgi and the cell surface, interactions of the transmembrane domain or TLR adapter molecules as crucial targets of trauma causing alteration of TLR expression and function.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref049">49</xref>] The same applies for the phagocytic activity of monocytes. Seshadri <italic>et al</italic>. observed a consistent phagocytic activity of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> despite an impaired TLR2 and MHC-II expression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref009">9</xref>] The authors concluded the reduced TLR2 expression can be compensated by other molecules involved in the regulation of phagocytosis. Another limitation of our study is clearly the use of different subspecies of pigs (<italic>German Landrace</italic> vs <italic>Petrain</italic>) in different parts of the study. Additionally to the different subspecies, the “polytrauma-pigs” had to undergo pre-trauma procedures (anesthesia and multiple catheters as described), which might have led to a priming of the immune cells, leading to an increased phagocytic activity before trauma compared to the “healthy” pigs. In future studies, different parts should be executed with specimen of the same subspecies receiving same treatments. However, the results in both parts of our study build on one another and the results and trends are reasonable. Additionally, other populations of monocytes (weakly CD14-positive, CD16-positive cells, etc.) have not been included in the analyses.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref050">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187404.ref052">52</xref>]</p>
<p>Our study must be regarded as a first approach to explore such phenomena, if the post-traumatic cellular physiology of pigs is comparable to the one of humans. We started experimentation for monocytes and our findings are promising. However, further studies must be done for different cell lines, even for the other mentioned populations of monocytes in order to truly establish a porcine large animal polytrauma model.</p>
<p>In summary, our results demonstrate that porcine monocytes, undergoing polytrauma, had a decreased TLR2 expression and an impaired maturation as well as a reduced bacterial clearance <italic>via</italic> phagocytosis in the early post-traumatic course. The deranged phagocytizing capacity is highly associated with the reduced TLR2 expression on monocytes, and may provide a new therapeutic target to improving phagocytosis during infection. Moreover, this porcine model is representative for the initially suppressed function of monocytes after trauma in humans.</p>
