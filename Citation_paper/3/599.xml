<title>Background</title>
<p>Sparganosis caused by invasion of the plerocercoid larvae (spargana) of <italic>Spirometra erinaceieuropaei</italic> have increased in recent years in China. However, the population genetic structure regarding this parasite is still unclear. In this study, we used the sequences of two mitochondrial genes cytochrome <italic>b</italic> (<italic>cytb</italic>) and cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase subunit I (<italic>cox1</italic>) to analyze genetic variation and phylogeographic structure of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>erinaceieuropaei</italic> populations.</p>

<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
<p>A total of 88 <italic>S</italic>. <italic>erinaceieuropaei</italic> isolates were collected from naturally infected frogs in 14 geographical locations of China. The complete <italic>cytb</italic> and <italic>cox1</italic> genes of each sample was amplified and sequenced. Total 61 haplotypes were found in these 88 concatenated sequences. Each sampled population and the total population have high haplotype diversity (Hd), accompanied by very low nucleotide diversity (Pi). Phylogenetic analyses of haplotypes revealed two distinct clades (HeN+HuN+GZ-AS clade and GX+HN+GZ-GY clade) corresponding two sub-networks yielded by the median-joining network. Pairwise <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> values supported great genetic differentiation between <italic>S</italic>. <italic>erinaceieuropaei</italic> populations. Both negative Fu’s <italic>F</italic><sub>S</sub> value of neutrality tests and unimodal curve of mismatch distribution analyses supported demographic population expansion in the HeN+HuN+GZ-AS clade. The BEAST analysis showed that the divergence time between the two clades took place in the early Pleistocene (1.16 Myr), and by Bayesian skyline plot (BSP) an expansion occurred after about 0.3 Myr ago.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Spirometra erinaceieuropaei</italic> (Cestoidea: Pseudophyllidea: Diphyllobothriidae) is one of the most important species of tapeworms [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Its plerocercoid larvae (spargana) can lodge in the subcutaneous tissues and sometimes invade the abdominal cavity, eye, and central nervous system of humans causing a serious parasitic zoonosis known as sparganosis [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Human infection results mainly from ingesting raw flesh of frogs and snakes infected with the plerocercoids, drinking raw water contaminated with cyclops harboring procercoids, or placing frog or snake flesh as poultice on open wound for treatment of skin ulcers or eye inflammations [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Sparganosis is distributed worldwide, but most cases occur in Eastern and Southeastern Asia [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. China has the largest number of sparganosis cases in the world since 1999, with a total of approximately 1,000 instances of human sparganosis being reported in 27 out of 34 provinces, autonomous regions, or municipal districts [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In addition, the local cases have increased in recent years and sparganosis has even been termed as emerging enzootic diseases in several districts of China [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Sparganosis not only poses a serious threat to human health, but also causes significant economic losses [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Consequently, knowledge regarding the distribution of the pathogen of this disease, the genetic characteristics of its populations in relation to local environmental conditions is valuable for the prevention and control of sparganosis in humans. Unfortunately, insufficient studies on population genetics of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>erinaceieuropaei</italic> have been carried out to date. Thus, it becomes important to analyze the population genetics and demographic history of this tapeworm, so that we can get valuable clues about the population changes and genetic variation affecting the pathogenicity [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Due to high and rapid mutational rate, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) remains one of the most powerful and reliable tools for detecting population structure and inferring population differences [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Previous studies showed that within mtDNA, there are regions that diverge rapidly, while other regions that are highly conserved, making the different regions suitable for analysis of different taxonomic levels [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The structure and function of cytochrome <italic>b</italic> (<italic>cytb</italic>) and cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase subunit I (<italic>cox1</italic>) genes have been verified in mtDNA sequences of cestodes and maintain a moderate evolutionary speed. Thus, <italic>cytb</italic> and <italic>cox1</italic> have been used to study the population structure and genetic differentiation of several tapeworm species [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic variability, population structure and divergence pattern among <italic>S</italic>. <italic>erinaceieuropaei</italic> populations from central and southern China based on <italic>cytb</italic> and <italic>cox1</italic> genes of mitochondrial DNA.</p>

<title>DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing</title>
<p>Total genomic DNA was extracted from individual sample of plerocercoid using the Tiangen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Tiangen, China) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The whole sequences of <italic>cytb</italic> and <italic>cox1</italic> genes were amplified with Cob-F/R and Cox1-F/R two sets of primers respectively according to Yanagida et al. [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Polymerase chain reaction (25μl) was performed in 2mM MgCl2, 2.5μM of each primer, 2.5μl 10× rTaq buffer, 0.5mM of each deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), 1.25U of rTaq DNA polymerase (Takara, China), and 1μl of DNA sample in a thermocycler under the following conditions: after an initial denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, then 94°C for 30 s (denaturation); 58°C for 30 s (annealing); 72°C for 1 min (extension) for 30 cycles, followed by a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. These optimized amplification conditions for the specific and efficient amplification of individual DNA fragments were obtained after varying annealing and extension temperatures. One microlitre (5–10 ng) of genomic DNA was added to each PCR reaction. Samples without genomic DNA (no-DNA controls) were included in each amplification run, and in no case were amplicons detected in the no-DNA controls (not shown). PCR products were purified using the High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Takara, China) and sequenced in both directions using an automated sequencer (ABI Prism 3730 XL DNA Analyzer; ABI Prism, Foster City, CA) at the Genwiz Company (Beijing, China).</p>

<title>Nucleotide polymorphism</title>
<p>Sequences of <italic>cytb</italic> and <italic>cox1</italic> genes were aligned using the computer program Clustal X 2.0 [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software version 5.0 [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] was employed to analyze the nucleotide composition, conserved sites, variable sites, parsimony-informative sites and singleton sites. The number of haplotypes, calculation of haplotype diversity (Hd) and nucleotide diversity (Pi) were performed using the program DnaSP v5.10.01 [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>

<sec id="sec010">
<title>Phylogenetic analysis</title>
<p>The phylogenetic relationship among haplotypes was estimated through three methods of maximum parsimony (MP), neighbor-joining (NJ) and Bayesian inference (BI), respectively. MP analysis was performed in PAUP*4b10 [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] using heuristic searches with TBR (tree bisection-reconnection) branch swapping and 2,000 random addition sequences. Confidence in each node was assessed by boot-strapping (2000 pseudo-replicates, heuristic search of 20 random addition replicates with TBR option). NJ analysis was also performed in PAUP*4b10 [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] using the Kimura two-parameter distance selected by Modeltest v3.7 [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] under the Akaike information criterion and the ‘heuristics’ search option with the ‘simple’ addition sequence and TBR swapping. BI analyses were performed in MrBayes v3.1 [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] with 5,000,000 generations, sampling trees every 100 generations. Stationarity was assessed using a convergence diagnostic. An average standard deviation of the split frequencies (ASDSF) &lt; 0.03 were used as criteria of convergence between both runs. Four <italic>Diphyllobothrium</italic> species: <italic>Diphyllobothrium nihonkaiense</italic> (Genbank accession number of cytb/cox1: AB508837/AB015755), <italic>D</italic>. <italic>latum</italic> (AB522608/AB511963), <italic>D</italic>. <italic>dendriticum</italic> (AB522613/KC812045) and <italic>D</italic>. <italic>ditremum</italic> (AB522617/FM209182) were used as outgroup to root the resulting trees. We also used NETWORK v4.5.0.2 [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] to draw a median-joining network to analyze the relationships among detected haplotypes.</p>

<p>The partitions of genetic diversity within and among populations were analyzed through analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] using the software Arlequin v3.5.1.2 [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. To estimate levels of genetic differentiation among the populations, a pairwise comparison test was performed based on Slatkin’s linearised <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] using Arlequin v3.5.1.2 [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

<title>Divergence time estimation</title>
<p>The approximate divergence times were estimated for the lineages of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>erinaceieuropaei</italic> with an uncorrelated log-normal relaxed molecular-clock model using the software BEAST v1.6.1 [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The substitution models were HKY+G for <italic>cytb</italic> and HKY+G+I for <italic>cox1</italic> following model selection by Modeltest v3.7 [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. For the tree prior, a basic coalescent model assuming a constant population size over the time period considered was chosen according to the reduced effective population size resulting from the selfing mode of reproduction of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>erinaceieuropaei</italic>. Posterior distributions of the parameters, including the tree, were estimated via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Two replicate MCMC runs were performed, with the tree and parameter values sampled every 1 000 steps over a total of 1 × 108 steps. The diagnostic software Tracer v1.5 [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] was used to assess convergence between runs, to estimate an appropriate number of samples to be discarded as burn-in, and to ensure that effective sample sizes (i.e., &gt;500) were sufficient to provide reasonable estimates of model parameter variance. LogCombiner v1.6.1 [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] was used to combine both runs. The sampled tree with the maximum product of clade credibilities was viewed using FigTree v1.3.1 [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The molecular evolutionary rate were fixed to 0.0195 and 0.0225 substitutions per site per million year (Myr) for <italic>cytb</italic> and <italic>cox1</italic> respectively, according to the substitution rates for <italic>cytb</italic> and <italic>cox1</italic> calculated based on the <italic>Taenia</italic> tapeworms [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>

<title>Demographic history of population</title>
<p>We applied Neutrality tests through the program Arlequin v3.5.1.2 [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] as an assessment of possible population expansion. Under the assumption of neutrality, a population expansion produces a large negative value of Fu’s <italic>F</italic><sub>S</sub> test [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and Tajima’s <italic>D</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Tajima’s <italic>D</italic> and Fu’s <italic>F</italic><sub>S</sub> are sensitive to bottleneck effects or population expansion, causing these values to be more significantly negative [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Fu’s <italic>F</italic><sub>S</sub> is particularly sensitive to recent population growth [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Population expansion events were determined through mismatch analysis [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] using Arlequin v3.5.1.2 [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] with the number of bootstrap replicates set to 5000. The validity of the expansion model was tested by using the sum of squared deviations (SSD) and Harpending’s raggedness index (Rag) between observed and expected mismatches. The Bayesian skyline plot (BSP) was used to estimate the demographic history of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>erinaceieuropaei</italic> using the program BEAST v1.6.1 [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A piecewise-constant skyline model was selected, and a relaxed uncorrelated log-normal molecular clock was used with the mutation rates of 1.95%/Myr for <italic>cytb</italic> and 2.25%/Myr for <italic>cox</italic>1 as suggested by Hoberg et al. [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and Michelet et al. [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

<p>The concatenated sequence alignment contained 88 sequences and 2676 positions, of which 1110 bp were sequenced for the <italic>cytb</italic> gene and 1566 bp for the <italic>cox1</italic> gene. The average base compositions of <italic>cytb</italic> and <italic>cox1</italic> were 46.1% and 46.0% (T), 18.6% and 18.3% (A), 23.5% and 23.6% (G), 11.8% and 12.1% (C) respectively, with AT-richness in the sequences. No insertions or deletions were detected. A total of 161 polymorphic sites were found, of which 150 were parsimony-informative and 11 were singleton-variable. These polymorphic sites identified 61 haplotypes within 88 isolates from fourteen localities (<xref rid="pone.0119295.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0119295.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Dataset.</xref>). Each sampled population and the total population have high Hd, accompanied by very low Pi (<xref rid="pone.0119295.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The genetic divergence of <italic>cytb</italic> and <italic>cox1</italic> sequences of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>erinaceieuropaei</italic> collected from fourteen geographical locations ranged from 0 to 3.6% and 0 to 4.9%, respectively.</p>

<p>The 61 haplotypes of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>erinaceieuropaei</italic> formed two distinct clades (clade I and clade II) in all phylogenetic analyses based on three methods: maximum parsimony (<xref rid="pone.0119295.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), neighbor-joining (<xref rid="pone.0119295.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>) and Bayesian inference (<xref rid="pone.0119295.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). Clade I included 46 individuals collected from Xinxiang (HeN-XX), Zhengzhou (HeN-ZZ), Kaifeng (HeN-KF), Zhoukou (HeN-ZK) and Luohe (HeN-LH) of Henan province in central China, Changsha (HuN-CS) and Jishou (HuN-JS) of Hunan province and Anshun (GZ-AS) of Guizhou province; Isolates within clade II came from Nanning (GX-NN), Guilin (GX-GL) and Yulin (GX-YL) of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Haikou (HN-HK) and Wuzhishan (HN-WZS) of Hainan province and Guiyang (GZ-GY) of Guizhou province (<xref rid="pone.0119295.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0119295.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0119295.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> Figs).

The divergence time of the HeN+HuN+GZ-AS clade (clade I) was estimated to begin at 0.55 Myr (in the middle Pleistocene) with a 95% HPD of 0.33–0.86 Myr. The early branching of the GX+HN+GZ-GY clade (clade II) started in the early Pleistocene (0.90 Myr, with a 95% HPD of 0.58–1.32 Myr). Approximately 1.14 Myr elapsed from the earliest divergence of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>erinaceieuropaei</italic> lineage to the time when all major haplotypes are present.</p>

<p>The results of neutral test analyses were submitted in the <xref rid="pone.0119295.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. All values of Fu’s <italic>F</italic><sub>S</sub> of clade I, clade II and total population were negative, however, only the value of clade I was significant.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In our study, the AT-richness of <italic>cytb</italic> and <italic>cox1</italic> genes exceeded 64.7% and 64.3% respectively, which were consistent with the results of studies of other tapeworms such as the <italic>Taenia</italic> species [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and the <italic>Diphyllobothrium</italic> species [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. As suggested by Neigel and Avise [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], the nucleotide diversity (Pi) value is an important index to measure the level of genetic diversity, and Pi &gt; 0.01 is considered to indicate a comparatively large variation in most animals. However, most Pi values were lower than 0.01 in this study, suggesting that there was low genetic variation of 88 isolates from 14 regions. The average genetic distances among 88 isolates from central and southern China are lower than 0.05. This is accord with the range of intraspecific genetic distance (0–0.05) reported by Nei et al. [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p>
<p>Some pioneering scientists have been concentrated their studies on the phylogeny of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>erinaceieuropaei</italic>. Okamoto et al. [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] evaluated the intraspecific variation of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>erinaceieuropaei</italic> and its phylogenetic relationship with <italic>Diphyllobothrium</italic> using partial sequences of the <italic>cox1</italic> gene, Dai et al. [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] examined sequence variability among and within three cestodes, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>erinaceieuropaei</italic>, <italic>Taenia multiceps</italic> and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>hydatigena</italic>, from different geographical origins in China based on partial <italic>cox1</italic>, <italic>nad4</italic> and ITS genes, Liu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] explored sequence variability in three mtDNA regions (<italic>cox3</italic>, <italic>nad1</italic> and <italic>nad4</italic>) in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>erinaceieuropaei</italic> spargana from different geographical regions in Hunan province of China, and Liang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] investigated sequence variability in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>erinaceieuropaei</italic> from dogs in Hunan province in China using partial <italic>cox1</italic> and a small subunit of ribosomal RNA (<italic>rrnS</italic>) region. All these studies supported the monophyly of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>erinaceieuropaei</italic> spargana isolates collected from different geographical locations or different hosts. Our analyses based on three phylogenetic inference methods (MP, NJ and BI) confirmed this conclusion too. In this study, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>erinaceieuropaei</italic> spargana isolates from central and southern China revealed in two distinct groups: HeN+HuN+GZ-AS group (clade I) and GX+HN+GZ-GY group (clade II) with high support values. The median-joining network yielded two subnetworks corresponding to the two clades in the phylogenetic tree (clade I and clade II), and there are no shared haplotypes between clades. Such distributions of haplotypes of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>erinaceieuropaei</italic> may be interpreted as being the result of population isolation [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p>
<p>The result obtained from AMOVA showed weak genetic variation within populations. The explanation may be that gene flow interrupts between the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>erinaceieuropaei</italic> isolates collected from different geographical locations [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Meanwhile, most pairwise <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> values between <italic>S</italic>. <italic>erinaceieuropaei</italic> populations were higher than 0.25, indicating great genetic differentiation[<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This evidenced that a long-term interruption of gene flow between two clades [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p>
<p>Estimation of divergence time from molecular data requires the selection of appropriate calibration information, such as fossil record or geological evidence [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Given a lack of fossils or geological events for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>erinaceieuropaei</italic>, we tended to use calibrating information based on substitution rates obtained from <italic>Taenia</italic> tapeworms for which there is a good fossil record or strong geological evidence dating a vicariance event [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Our data suggest that the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>erinaceieuropaei</italic> lineage separated 1.16 Myr ago, during early Pleistocene. This date is earlier than the divergence time between Asian lineage and African–American lineage of <italic>Taenia solium</italic> (in the middle Pleistocene) calculated using <italic>cytb</italic> and <italic>cox1</italic> genes [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The average age estimates of most of the haplotypes imply that they originated within a 0.88 Myr time window (∼0.02–0.90 Myr) about 0.26 Mya after the origin of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>erinaceieuropaei</italic>. And during about 0.57–0.02 Myr ago (between dotted line a and dotted line b in the <xref rid="pone.0119295.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), most of haplotypes appeared.</p>
<p>The divergence patterns of species can be driven by climatic fluctuations [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Tremendous climatic changes, particularly the Quaternary glaciations have made many plants and animals extinct and influenced the evolution and distribution of many plants and animals in China and its neighboring areas [<xref rid="pone.0119295.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In our study, the neutrality test Fu’s <italic>F</italic><sub>S</sub> result of clade I was significantly negative, and mismatch distribution statistic support the assumption of population expansion of HeN+HuN+GZ-AS group in the past. The BEAST analysis showed that most of haplotypes appeared during the middle and late Pleistocene, coinciding with the Bayesian skyline plot (BSP) analysis: a population expansion occurred after about 0.3 Myr ago (in the middle Pleistocene). The climatic oscillations during glacial periods in the Quaternary may affected the demography and diversification of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>erinaceieuropaei</italic> from Henan and Hunan provinces in China. However, the demography and diversification pattern of GX+HN+GZ-GY group requires further research to clarify the definitive reason.</p>
<p>In conclusion, <italic>Spirometra erinaceieuropaei</italic> from central and southern China can be divided into two populations: the HeN+HuN+GZ-AS group and the GX+HN+GZ-GY group, and the two groups diverged from each other during the early Pleistocene. The climatic fluctuations in the Quaternary probably impacted the demography and diversification of the HeN+HuN+GZ-AS group.</p>
