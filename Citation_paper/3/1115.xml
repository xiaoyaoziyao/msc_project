<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Opioid receptors are currently classified as Mu (μ), Delta (δ), Kappa (κ) plus the opioid related nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) peptide receptor (NOP). Despite compelling evidence for interactions and benefits of targeting more than one receptor type in producing analgesia, clinical ligands are Mu agonists. In this study we have designed a Mu-NOP agonist named DeNo. The Mu agonist component is provided by dermorphin, a peptide isolated from the skin of Phyllomedusa frogs and the NOP component by the endogenous agonist N/OFQ.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We have assessed receptor binding profile of DeNo and compared with dermorphin and N/OFQ. In a series of functional screens we have assessed the ability to (i) increase Ca<sup>2+</sup> in cells coexpressing recombinant receptors and a the chimeric protein Gα<sub>qi5</sub>, (ii) stimulate the binding of GTPγ[<sup>35</sup>S], (iii) inhibit cAMP formation, (iv) activate MAPKinase, (v) stimulate receptor-G protein and arrestin interaction using BRET, (vi) electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum (gpI) assay and (vii) ability to produce analgesia via the intrathecal route in rats.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Results</title>
<p>DeNo bound to Mu (pK<sub>i</sub>; 9.55) and NOP (pK<sub>i</sub>; 10.22) and with reasonable selectivity. This translated to increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> in Gα<sub>qi5</sub> expressing cells (pEC<sub>50</sub> Mu 7.17; NOP 9.69), increased binding of GTPγ[<sup>35</sup>S] (pEC<sub>50</sub> Mu 7.70; NOP 9.50) and receptor-G protein interaction in BRET (pEC<sub>50</sub> Mu 8.01; NOP 9.02). cAMP formation was inhibited and arrestin was activated (pEC<sub>50</sub> Mu 6.36; NOP 8.19). For MAPK DeNo activated p38 and ERK1/2 at Mu but only ERK1/2 at NOP. In the gpI DeNO inhibited electrically-evoked contractions (pEC<sub>50</sub> 8.63) that was sensitive to both Mu and NOP antagonists. DeNo was antinociceptive in rats.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec004">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Collectively these data validate the strategy used to create a novel bivalent Mu-NOP peptide agonist by combining dermorphin (Mu) and N/OFQ (NOP). This molecule behaves essentially as the parent compounds in vitro. In the antonocicoeptive assays employed in this study DeNo displays only weak antinociceptive properties.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>While the majority of clinical opioids mainly target the Mu (μ) receptor, work in cell and animal models would suggest targeting two or more opioid receptors simultaneously may produce drugs with reduced harmful effects. A large body of this work has concentrated on simultaneous targeting of the Delta (δ) receptor to produce drugs with attenuated tolerance profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref003">3</xref>]. Work in <italic>in vitro</italic> cell based systems has demonstrated that antagonism of Delta, or disruption of the Mu-Delta heterodimer, leads to recycling of the Mu receptor, rather than ubiquitination after activation and internalisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref006">6</xref>]. These findings were confirmed in animal studies with Delta knockout mice showing a complete attenuation of morphine tolerance, as did preproenkephalin knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref007">7</xref>]. Despite this compelling evidence no Mu-Delta mixed ligands have yet reached the clinic.</p>
<p>The nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) peptide receptor (NOP) is a comparatively new member of the opioid family and is often referred to as a ‘non-opioid branch” due to little or no affinity for the non-selective opioid antagonist, naloxone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref008">8</xref>]. The NOP receptor is located throughout the pain pathways producing anti-opioid effects supraspinally and analgesic effects spinally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref011">11</xref>]. NOP has been shown to co-localise in the pain pathways with Mu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref009">9</xref>]. Activation of the NOP receptor has demonstrated several advantages over the classical opioid receptors. For instance, NOP agonists are able to efficiently treat neuropathic pain, a condition which classical opioid do not adequately treat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref009">9</xref>]. Of particular note, intrathecal co-administration of N/OFQ and morphine in non-human primates led to a potentiation of morphine-induced antinociception, without the associated morphine-induced side effects (itch) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref012">12</xref>]. From a cellular perspective, Mu and NOP have been demonstrated to co-express in close proximity and display differential signalling activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting the formation of a heterodimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Results from both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models have subsequently led to the development of a number of mixed molecules targeted to Mu and NOP. One of the first examples of a mixed NOP-opioid ligand was [Dmt<sup>1</sup>]N/OFQ(1–13)-NH<sub>2</sub>, a non-selective opioid agonist acting at both the classical opioid receptors and NOP. [Dmt<sup>1</sup>]N/OFQ(1–13)-NH<sub>2</sub> demonstrated potent and sustained activity <italic>in vivo</italic> in the monkey tail withdraw assay, with a 30-fold increase in potency over N/OFQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref016">16</xref>]. The most recently developed Mu-NOP bifunctional pharmacophore is cebranopadol. Cebranopadol is a full Mu agonist and a high efficacy partial agonist at NOP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref017">17</xref>]. In rat models, cebranopadol demonstrated a long duration of action and did not disrupt motor coordination or respiration. Furthermore, cebranopadol produced tolerance by 26 days compared to only 11 days for morphine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref018">18</xref>]. The results demonstrated by cebranopadol would suggest that targeting of Mu and NOP could provide substantial improvement in the treatment of pain. To further understand the interactions between Mu and NOP, a detailed examination of the interactions of a full agonist dual-targeted drug needs to be further made. In order to further explore the interactions between Mu and NOP we have synthesized a mixed Mu-NOP agonist named DeNo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156897.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The Mu agonist component is provided by dermorphin, a peptide isolated from the skin of <italic>Phyllomedusa</italic> frogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref019">19</xref>]. The NOP component is the endogenous agonist N/OFQ. We have assessed receptor binding, upstream and downstream signalling in cells and tissues and assessed in vivo spinal anti-nociceptive effects in rats.</p>

<title>Materials</title>
<p>The reference molecules, dermorphin, Leu-enkephalin, Dynorphin-A and N/OFQ were synthesised in house (Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Ferrara). Tritiated UFP-101 ([<sup>3</sup>H]-UFP-101) was synthesized as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref020">20</xref>]. Tritiated diprenorphine ([<sup>3</sup>H]-DPN) and [<sup>3</sup>H]-cyclic Adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) were purchased from Perkin Elmer. Naloxone was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (Dorset, U.K.). Naltrindole (Delta antagonist) and [D-Pen<sup>2</sup>, D-Pen<sup>5</sup>]-enkephalin (Delta agonist, DPDPE) were purchased from Tocris (Abingdon, UK). Antibodies and protein ladders were purchased from Cell Signalling (Boston, MA, USA). All tissue culture media and supplements were obtained from Invitrogen (Paisley, U.K.).</p>

<title>Synthesis of DeNo</title>
<p>DeNo was assembled using a classical thiol-Michael reaction; reacting in solution a thiol function inserted in the N/OFQ sequence with a maleimide function inserted into the dermorphin sequence. In detail, [Cys<sup>18</sup>]N/OFQ-NH<sub>2</sub> was synthesized and purified in house while the synthesis of dermorphin elongated in the C-terminal with Lys(maleimide) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156897.g001">Fig 1</xref>) was performed using classical solid phase peptide synthesis techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref021">21</xref>]. Selective deprotection of the Lys side chain of the intermediate [Lys(Dde)<sup>8</sup>]dermorphin-resin was achieved following the procedure of Bycroft et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref022">22</xref>]. To a suspension of protected [Lys(Dde)<sup>8</sup>] Der-resin (300 mg) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (3 ml), 2% hydrazine in methanol (5 ml) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred under argon for 30 min, then filtered and the resin washed 3 times with dimethylformamide (DMF,5 ml) and CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (5 ml). To a stirred solution of 4-(2,5-dioxo-2,5-dihydro-1Hpyrrol- 1-yl)butanoic acid (0.2 mmol) in (DMF) (5 mL) at 0°C, [O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate] (HATU) (0.2 mmol) and 4-methylmorpholine (0.2 mmol) were added. After 10 min, [Lys(free side chain)<sup>8</sup>]dermorpin-resin (200 mg, 0.67 meq/gr; 0.13 meq) was added and the reaction mixture stirred at room temperature for 4 h. The solution was then filtered and the resin washed 5 times with DMF (5 ml) and 3 times with CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (5 ml). The protected [Lys(Mal)<sup>8</sup>]dermorphin-resin was treated with reagent B (trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) / H<sub>2</sub>0 / phenol / triisopropylsilane 88: 5: 5: 2; v/v; 10 mL / 0.2 g of resin) for 1.5 h at room temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref023">23</xref>]. After filtration of the resin, the solvent was concentrated under vacuum and the residue triturated with ethyl ether. Crude peptide was purified by preparative reverse phase HPLC and lyophilized. Finally, [Cys<sup>18</sup>]N/OFQ-NH<sub>2</sub> was reacted with [Lys(Mal)<sup>8</sup>]dermorphin following a procedure reported in literature and then purified by preparative HPLC to give the desired final product after lyophilisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref024">24</xref>].</p>

<title>Cell Culture</title>
<p>Cells were grown in either Hams F12 (for Chinese Hamster Ovary; CHO<sub>hMu</sub>, CHO<sub>hDelta</sub> and CHO<sub>hKappa</sub> cells), DMEM/Hams F12 1:1 (for CHO<sub>hNOP</sub> cells and SH-SY5Y cells) or DMEM (for HEK-293 cells). The media contained 100 μg ml<sup>-1</sup> streptomycin, 2.5 μg ml<sup>-1</sup> fungizone, 100 IU ml<sup>-1</sup> penicillin and 10% foetal bovine serum. G418 (200 μg ml<sup>-1</sup>) was used to maintain CHO cells expressing classical opioid receptors. Stock media containing G418 (200 μg ml<sup>-1</sup>) and hygromycin B (200 μg ml<sup>-1</sup>) was used to maintain CHO<sub>hNOP</sub> cells. HEK-293 cells permanently co-expressing the fusion proteins NOP-Rluc and Gβ1-RGFP or NOP-Rluc and β-arrestin 2-RGFP and SH-SY5Y cells co-expressing the fusion proteins Mu-Rluc and Gβ1-RGFP or Mu-Rluc and β-arrestin 2-RGFP were prepared using the pantropic retroviral expression system by Clontech as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref025">25</xref>]. Cells were used for experiments once confluent.

To detect phosphorylated ERK1/2 and phosphorylated p38 activity, pERK1/2 antibodies (1:6000 dilution) and p38 antibodies (1:3000dilution), diluted in TBS-T solution [50 mM Tris-base, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20 (vol/vol), pH 7.5] with 0.01% (wt/vol) BSA, were used to probe the membrane and left overnight at 4°C. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit antibodies (1hr room temperature, 1:1000 dilution in TBS-T with 5% milk) were used to visualise immune-reactive bands, followed by chemiluminescence detection using the ChemiDoc™ MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad). In order to ensure equal gel loading, membranes were stripped and reprobed for total ERK1/2 and total p38 MAPK. Membranes were incubated in Restore Plus™ (Fisher) for 15 minutes then thoroughly washed in TBS-T, following which they were blocked as previously described. The membrane was then probed using the specific antibody for ERK 1/2 (NEBL, 1:3000 dilution), or p38 (NEBL, 1:3000 dilution), overnight (4°C) followed by addition of the secondary antibody and chemiluminescence detection. Normalisation of total protein levels for each sample was then achieved by representing levels of pERK1/2 and p-p38 as a proportion of total ERK1/2 or total p38 protein.

<p>Membrane extracts taken from HEK-293 and SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing NOP-RLuc and Mu-RLuc respectively together with Gβ<sub>1</sub>-RGFP were used to assess the effects of drugs on receptor/G protein interaction in concentration response curve experiments. For G-protein experiments, enriched plasma membrane aliquots from transfected cells were prepared by differential centrifugation; cells were detached with PBS/EDTA solution (1 mM, pH 7.4 NaOH) then, after 5 min 500 g centrifugation, Dounce-homogenized (30 strokes) in cold homogenization buffer (TRIS 5 mM, EGTA 1 mM, DTT 1 mM, pH 7.4 HCl) in the presence of sucrose 0.32 M. Three further centrifugations were performed at 1000 g (4°C) and the supernatants kept.

The protein concentration in membrane preparations was determined using the QPRO-BCA kit (Cyanagen Srl, Bologna, IT) and a Beckman DU 520 spectrophotometer (Brea, CA, USA). Luminescence in membranes was recorded in 96-well untreated white opaque microplates (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) using the Victor 2030 luminometer (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). For the determination of receptor/G-protein interaction, membranes (3 μg of protein) prepared from cells co-expressing NOP or Mu-RLuc and Gβ1-RGFP were added to wells in Dulbecco’s PBS. For the determination of receptor/β-arrestin 2 interaction, cells co-expressing NOP-RLuc or Mu-RLuc and β-arrestin 2-RGFP were plated 24 h before the experiment in poly-D-Lysine treated plates (100,000 cells/well), while for Mu expressing cells untreated plates were used. The cells were prepared for the experiment substituting the medium with DPBS supplemented with MgCl<sub>2</sub> (0.5 mM) and CaCl<sub>2</sub> (0.9 mM). Coelenterazine, at a final concentration of 5 μM, was injected 15 minutes prior to reading the cell plate. Receptor/G protein interaction was measured in cell membranes to exclude the participation of other cellular processes (i.e. arrestin recruitment, internalization). Different concentrations of ligands in 20 μL of PBS—BSA 0.03% were added and incubated for an additional 5 min before reading luminescence. All experiments were performed at room temperature.</p>

Rats were shaved on the back of the neck and placed in the stereotaxic frame with the head securely held between ear bars. The skin over the nape of the neck was cleaned with ethyl alcohol and incised for 1 cm. The muscle on either side of the external occipital crest was detached and retracted to expose about 3–4 mm<sup>2</sup> of the atlanto-occipital membrane. The membrane was incised by a needle, which led to the escape of cerebrospinal fluid. The caudal edge of the cut was lifted and about 7.0 cm of 28G polyurethane catheter (0.36 mm outer diameter; 0.18 mm inner diameter; Alzet, USA) was gently inserted into the intrathecal space in the midline, dorsal to the spinal cord until the lumbar enlargement. The exit end of the catheter was connected to 4.0 cm polyurethane tube (0.84 mm outer diameter; 0.36 mm inner diameter) and was taken out through the skin, flushed with saline solution, sealed and securely fixed on the back of the head with a silk wire. Animals were placed in individual cages until recovery. All animals used during behavioural tests did not show surgery induced motor impairment as evaluated by Rota rod test.

<p>To further assess functional activity of DeNo, inhibition of cyclic AMP (cAMP) formation was assessed. Since DeNo demonstrated a higher affinity and potency at Mu and NOP, assays were performed using CHO<sub>hMu</sub> and CHO<sub>hNOP</sub> cells only. Addition of forskolin in CHO<sub>hMu</sub> cells lead to a 24.3 (±1.79) fold increase in cAMP production, when compared to basal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156897.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Co-incubation of 1μM dermorphin, or 1μM DeNo reverses the effects of forskolin, returning cAMP levels to basal. In CHO<sub>hNOP</sub> cells, forskolin stimulation leads to a 21.23 (±3.86) fold increase in cAMP production, when compared to basal activity.

<p>In order to determine the site of action of DeNo in the guinea pig ileum, antagonist assays were undertaken. The standard non-selective opioid antagonist naloxone (100 nM) does not affect the inhibitory action of N/OFQ, while 100 nM SB-612111 was able to shift to the right the concentration response curve to N/OFQ with a pK<sub>b</sub> of 8.36. In contrast, the effects of dermorphin were sensitive to naloxone (pK<sub>b</sub> 8.57) but not to SB-612111 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156897.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Finally, the effects of DeNo were challenged with naloxone, SB-612111, and the cocktail of the two antagonists. Naloxone antagonized the inhibitory effect of DeNo producing a rightward shift of the concentration response curve and no modification of maximal effects. A pK<sub>b</sub> value of 7.54 was derived from these experiments. SB-612111 was also able to counteract DeNo effects by producing a displacement to the right of the concentration response curve; a pK<sub>b</sub> value of 7.07 was derived from these experiments. When the two antagonists were assayed together they displayed a clear additive effect.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we have characterised a novel peptide bivalent Mu-NOP ligand, DeNo; created by combining dermorphin and N/OFQ. DeNo bound to Mu and NOP receptors and was ~5fold NOP selective. There was between 1 and 2 logs selectivity over Delta and Kappa receptors. At conventional upstream (GTPγ[<sup>35</sup>S]) and downstream (cAMP) assays and in Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilisation experiments using chimeric G-protein constructs DeNo was a full agonist at both Mu and NOP. In BRET assays to assess receptor G-protein interaction and arrestin recruitment, DeNo also behaved as a full agonist. Moreover, DeNo activated ERK1/2 as a full agonist at Mu and NOP; there was no activation of p38 at NOP. In a more intact preparation DeNo inhibited contraction of the electrically stimulated gpI via simultaneous activation of NOP and Opioid receptors and was antinociceptive via the i.t. route in rats.</p>
<p>At the receptor, the most striking difference was a log increase in DeNo binding affinity at Mu compared to dermorphin and this may result from the structure of the linker between the two ‘pharmacophores’. Comparing CHO data and taking into account different assays/buffer systems there was a marked difference in pK<sub>i</sub> / pEC<sub>50</sub> for Mu falling 60 fold at GTPγ[<sup>35</sup>S] (upstream) and 331 fold at the chimeric G-protein (downstream). In contrast at NOP there was a 7 and 3 fold difference in affinity compared to potency. As the point of interrogation (assay) moved further down the signal transduction cascade the difference in potency at Mu and NOP increased. For example in GTPγ[<sup>35</sup>S] assay DeNo was 38 fold more potent at NOP and 331 fold more potent in the chimeric G-protein assay. In all assays DeNo was a full agonist. If there was amplification or a coupling reserve then the potency values should shift leftwards rather than rightwards. This rightward shift was more marked at Mu than NOP and could be explained by buffer composition and end point. It is well documented that the chimeric G-protein assay suffers from hemi-equilibrium problems and we have discussed this in detail previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref038">38</xref>].</p>
<p>Using BRET based assays, we have been able to assess receptor/G protein interaction and arrestin recruitment. These end points were examined in HEK cells for NOP and SH-SY5Y cells for Mu; this is a minor drawback in comparison with the other assays reported but because we have used dermorphin and N/OFQ then we can cross compare. In all assays, the parent compounds and DeNo behaved in essentially the same manner (potency) and as full agonists. A possible confounder is that SH-SY5Y cells have been shown to express both the Delta receptor and, more relevantly, the NOP receptor; at very low expression levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref039">39</xref>]. Previous work with Mu/NOP heterodimers has demonstrated that activation of NOP often leads to a reduction in the potency of Mu agonists throughout the cell signalling cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref015">15</xref>]. It is possible in this cell line that DeNo is engaging both Mu and NOP. It has been known for some time that opioid receptors couple to MAPK with some variation in coupling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref041">41</xref>]. In CHO cells expressing recombinant Mu and NOP there were marked differences. ERK1/2 was ubiquitously activated but p38 was only activated by Mu. ERK1/2 is typically involved in proliferative and differentiation responses but there is good evidence for a role in more chronic opioid receptor activation and possibly withdrawal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref044">44</xref>]. This kinase along with p38 also plays a role in apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref045">45</xref>]; the distinction of roles is not clear cut. In terms of activation, two pathways have been suggested-the first involving a typical G-protein mediated event and the second via an arrestin–MAPK protein scaffold. That arrestin is activated is confirmed by the BRET assay but without full concentration response curves and pertussis toxin sensitivity experiments it is not possible to delineate the relative importance of these pathways. The fact that dermorphin and N/OFQ behaved as full agonists with no striking differences in potency suggests no ligand bias as expected for naturally occurring agonists. We have used the gpI as a more intact bioassay that (1) endogenously expresses both Mu and NOP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref033">33</xref>] and (2) links the in vitro recombinant data set to the in vivo behavioural experiments. In this preparation, N/OFQ was sensitive to the non-peptide antagonist SB-612111 but not naloxone; dermorphin was sensitive to naloxone but not SB-612111. These antagonists displayed lower potency when tested against DeNo whose concentration response curve was additively shifted when a cocktail of antagonists was used. Collectively, these results demonstrated that the biological action of DeNo in this preparation is due to the simultaneous activation of NOP and Mu receptors despite the greater loss of potency at Mu than at NOP found in recombinant systems.</p>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic>, after spinal administration in rats dermorphin (present results) and N/OFQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref046">46</xref>] elicited similar antinociceptive actions. Under the same experimental conditions, DeNo mimicked the effects of dermorphin and N/OFQ being neither more potent nor more effective. This result contrasts with the extensive literature evidence suggesting that the simultaneous activation of Mu and NOP receptor elicits synergistic antinociceptive effects both in rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref049">49</xref>] and in non-human primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref051">51</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies clearly demonstrated that DeNo is able to bind and activate both Mu and NOP receptor in the same range of concentrations; this may not be the case <italic>in vivo</italic>. A similar situation has been previously well documented in the studies of the MDAN series of compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref052">52</xref>]. Under the present experimental conditions there were almost no differences between doses inducing antinociceptive effects and those disrupting animal performance on the rotarod. Further studies are needed to assess in detail any potential spinal antinociceptive actions of DeNo.</p>
<p>In conclusion we have created a novel bivalent Mu-NOP peptide agonist by combining dermorphin (Mu) and N/OFQ (NOP); this molecule behaves essentially as the parent compounds. Despite this promising profile, analgesic actions of DeNo are poor in the model employed here. As a mixed molecule, this ligand represents a useful addition to the non-peptides BU08028 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref054">54</xref>], the SRI-International compounds exemplified by SR16435 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref054">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156897.ref055">55</xref>] cebranopadol and the peptide [Dmt<sup>1</sup>]N/OFQ(1–13)-NH<sub>2</sub>. DeNo may be a useful tool, particularly <italic>in vitro</italic> for investigating the consequences of the simultaneous activation of NOP and mu receptors.</p>
