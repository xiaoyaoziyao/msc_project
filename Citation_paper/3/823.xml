      <abstract>
        <p>Postpartum, infants have not yet established a fully functional adaptive immune system and are at risk of acquiring infections. Hence, newborns are dependent on the innate immune system with its antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and proteins expressed at epithelial surfaces. Several factors in breast milk are known to confer immune protection, but which the decisive factors are and through which manner they work is unknown. Here, we isolated an AMP-inducing factor from human milk and identified it by electrospray mass spectrometry and NMR to be lactose. It induces the gene (<italic>CAMP</italic>) that encodes the only human cathelicidin LL-37 in colonic epithelial cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The induction was suppressed by two different p38 antagonists, indicating an effect via the p38-dependent pathway. Lactose also induced <italic>CAMP</italic> in the colonic epithelial cell line T84 and in THP-1 monocytes and macrophages. It further exhibited a synergistic effect with butyrate and phenylbutyrate on <italic>CAMP</italic> induction. Together, these results suggest an additional function of lactose in innate immunity by upregulating gastrointestinal AMPs that may lead to protection of the neonatal gut against pathogens and regulation of the microbiota of the infant.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The adaptive immune system of infants lacks antibodies specific for common pathogenic microbes and is deficient in differentiated immune cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Schelonka1">[1]</xref>. This raises questions concerning the immune protection of newborns. Accumulating evidence suggests that neonates rely on innate immunity to combat infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Yoshio1">[2]</xref>. Neonates must also establish their microbiota in order to generate a balance between immune defense and tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Palmer1">[3]</xref>. During this prolonged and sensitive period infants are susceptible to infections such as diarrheal diseases, one of the leading causes of child mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Black1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and proteins are essential components in the defense against gastrointestinal infections, but also in shaping the microbiota <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Salzman1">[5]</xref>. Already at birth AMPs are present at several sites, such as the skin, <italic>vernix caseosa</italic>, and the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-KaiLarsen1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Marchini1">[8]</xref>. In addition, neonates obtain maternal immune support through factors in breast milk, like glycans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Dai1">[9]</xref>, secretory IgA antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Field1">[10]</xref>, lactoferrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Lonnerdal1">[11]</xref> and AMPs, such as human β-defensins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Armogida1">[12]</xref>. Moreover, milk nutrients contribute to the immune defense (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-HoseaBlewett1">[13]</xref>). It is established that breast-fed infants harbor better immune defenses against several types of infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Hanson1">[14]</xref> and exhibit lower frequencies of inflammatory diseases than formula-fed infants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Lucas1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Quigley1">[16]</xref>. This implies that milk, apart from being a nutritional source, can augment the immune defense of infants. Studies on immunological factors of human breast milk have mainly focused on direct antimicrobial effects (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Field1">[10]</xref>) and less on the capacity to modulate the expression of infant immune genes.</p>
      <p>Cathelicidins and defensins constitute major AMP families in mammals. In humans, the cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (<italic>CAMP</italic>) gene encodes the sole human homolog, LL-37 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Gudmundsson1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Frohm1">[18]</xref>, an amphipatic, α-helical peptide derived from the inactive precursor hCAP-18 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Cowland1">[19]</xref>. LL-37 is present in epithelial cells, monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Gudmundsson1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-FrohmNilsson1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Agerberth1">[21]</xref>. The expression is constitutive or can be induced by factors such as vitamin D and butyrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Schauber1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Wang1">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We have recently demonstrated that the level of LL-37 is higher in neonatal feces than in meconium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-KaiLarsen1">[6]</xref>, suggesting that milk factors can be important inducers of LL-37 expression. We here demonstrate that human breast milk induces the expression of <italic>CAMP</italic> in epithelial and monocytic cells and we identify lactose as the responsible intrinsic factor. We further show that the induction is mediated by p38 and JNK and that lactose together with butyrate or phenylbutyrate synergistically enhance <italic>CAMP</italic> gene expression. Thus, lactose has a hitherto unknown function in innate immunity.</p>

        <p>The data were analyzed anonymously. Ethic permission is not applicable for these samples in accordance with Swedish law (2003∶460, §4). The human milk donors were informed both verbally and in writing that the samples were to be used for research purposes. Also, the parents of the infants whose fecal samples were analyzed were informed, both verbally and in writing, that the samples would be used for research. The parents of these neonates gave their consent verbally, and not in writing, in order to keep the samples anonymous. These consents are not documented. However, the parents anonymously filled out a form with information about the delivery type, breast feeding, and use of antibiotics.</p>

        <p>The hydrophilic fraction of breast milk was passed through a 10 kDa cut-off filter (Amicon Ultra, Millipore, Carrigtwohill, Ireland). The low-molecular weight fraction was fractionated on a cationic exchange column (140×16 mm, S-sepharose) (GE healthcare Life science, Uppsala, Sweden) using the ÄKTA HPLC system (GE Healthcare). The column was equilibrated in 0.2M acetic acid and a gradient of 0–5% buffer B was employed (0.2M acetic acid in 1.5M ammonium acetate) for 3.75 column volume (CV) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and the column effluent was monitored at 230, 260 and 280 nm. Size exclusion chromatography was performed by injecting 400 µl of the active fraction from cationic exchange chromatography onto a Superdex peptide column (10×300 mm, GE Healthcare) in 100 mM ammonium acetate at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and column effluent was monitored at 230, 260 and 280 nm.</p>

The Caco-2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagles medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% FCS, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen). The VA-10 cells were cultured in bronchial epithelial cell basal medium (BEBM) (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Halldorsson1">[26]</xref>. T84 cells were cultured in a 1∶1 mixture of Ham’s F12 medium and DMEM supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine and 5% FCS. For differentiation of THP-1 cells into macrophage-like cells these were incubated with 100 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, PMA (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK) for 48 h and only adherent cells were used for stimulations.

        <title>CAMP Gene Expression is Induced by Breast Milk</title>
        <p>We first separated human breast milk into a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic fraction using the Folch method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Folch1">[25]</xref>. The lyophilized fractions, reconstituted in water and isopropanol, respectively, were incubated at 5 or 50 g/l for 4, 24 or 48 h in HT-29 cells. Real-time PCR showed a significant induction (*** p≤0.001) of <italic>CAMP</italic> gene transcript upon stimulation with 50 g/l of the hydrophilic fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053876-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), 6.5-fold after 24 h and 10.8-fold after 48 h. The hydrophilic fraction at 5 g/l (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053876-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) required 48 h for significant induction (*** p≤0.001) of <italic>CAMP</italic> gene transcript. Much lower or no induced expression of <italic>CAMP</italic> gene mRNA was observed with the hydrophobic fraction at both concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053876-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Higher concentrations of the proform hCAP-18 were detected by Western blot analysis in supernatants from cells stimulated with the hydrophilic fraction than in unstimulated controls (US) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053876-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Only a low concentration of the mature peptide LL-37 was observed, indicating mRNA induction, translation and secretion of hCAP-18 with limited processing into LL-37. LL-37/hCAP-18 could not be detected in breast milk or in the hydrophilic fraction (data not shown), in contrast to previously reported results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Murakami1">[28]</xref>. In addition, colonic epithelial cell lines Caco-2 and T84, THP-1 monocytes/macrophages, and the bronchial epithelial cell line VA-10 were also assayed for <italic>CAMP</italic> gene expression after stimulation with the hydrophilic fraction. Stimulation of Caco-2 and T84 cells with 50 g/l hydrophilic fraction resulted after 48 h in a significant increase in <italic>CAMP</italic> gene expression to 2.5 and 1.7-fold (** p≤0.005 and * p≤0.05), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053876-g002">Fig. 2A and B</xref>).

Stimulation with lactose or sodium butyrate alone resulted in a 10-and 120-fold induction in <italic>CAMP</italic> gene expression, respectively. Interestingly, upon stimulation of cells with lactose and sodium butyrate in combination a 294-fold induction was observed. Furthermore, a 1018-fold induction of <italic>CAMP</italic> gene transcript was noted in cells with lactose and phenylbutyrate in combination, compared to a 67-fold induction with phenylbutyrate alone. However, no synergistic effect was observed when the cells were stimulated with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> in combination with lactose. These results demonstrate that there is a synergistic effect of both sodium butyrate or phenylbutyrate together with lactose in colonic epithelial cells.</p>

Lactose enhanced the level of <italic>CAMP</italic> gene transcript 10-fold, sodium butyrate 120-fold, whereas a combination of lactose and sodium butyrate resulted in a 294-fold <italic>CAMP</italic> gene induction. Stimulation with phenylbutyrate resulted in a 67-fold induction, whereas a 1018-fold induction was observed with lactose and phenylbutyrate in combination. (<bold>B</bold>) HT-29 cells were stimulated for 48 h with 0.2M lactose, maltose, trehalose, mannitol, glucose (Glu) and galactose (Gal). Lactose resulted in an induction of <italic>CAMP</italic> gene transcript 5.1-fold, trehalose 26.6-fold, maltose 9.2-fold, glucose 2.2-fold galactose 1.8-fold and mannitol 1.8 fold. Stimulation with 0.2M glucose and 0.2M galactose in combination induced <italic>CAMP</italic> gene transcript by 9.5-fold. No induction was observed when stimulation for 48 h with 0.2–0.4 M NaCl or 0.2 M KCl.

Maltose and trehalose at 0.2M were capable of inducing <italic>CAMP</italic> gene transcript by 9.2- and 26.6-fold, respectively, compared to a 5.1-fold induction achieved by 0.2M lactose alone.

In order to evaluate if the lactose-mediated induction of <italic>CAMP</italic> was dependent on an increase in the osmolarity, HT-29 cells were stimulated with NaCl, KCl and the non-metabolizable sugar alcohol mannitol for 48 h at equimolar concentrations (or higher) as lactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053876-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study human breast milk was found to induce the expression of the <italic>CAMP</italic> gene encoding LL-37 in colonic epithelial cell lines and THP-1 monocytes/macrophages. After isolation lactose was identified by mass spectrometry and NMR as the inducing component. The <italic>CAMP</italic> gene inducing capacity of commercially available lactose was comparable to that of breast milk and dependent on p38- and JNK- pathways. Interestingly, the composition of milk changes with days postpartum: the concentration of lactose increases considerably from colostrum (∼40 g/l) to transitional milk (∼65 g/l) and is further increased in mature milk (∼75 g/l) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Saint1">[31]</xref>. This correlates with the increased <italic>CAMP</italic> gene expression observed with the hydrophilic fraction of mature milk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053876-g003">Fig. 3A and B</xref>), further supporting that lactose in breast milk is a major inducer of the <italic>CAMP</italic> gene. Albeit, there are most likely additional AMP-inducing compounds in breast milk. This may explain the residual <italic>CAMP</italic> gene inducing activity observed in material from the chromatographic fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053876-g004">Fig. 4B and C</xref>).</p>
      <p>It is well known that lactose is first hydrolyzed into its glucose and galactose moieties by lactase, located in the mucosa of the small intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Heyman1">[32]</xref>. Our results demonstrate no detectable levels of lactose in fecal samples of both one and four week old infants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053876-t001">Table 1</xref>). This suggest an efficient hydrolysis of lactose in the small bowel, which is in agreement with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Counahan1">[33]</xref>. Hoerver, we cannot rule out the possibility that a part of the lactose is internalized by the colonic epithelial cells.</p>

      <p>In addition to lactose, the levels of galactose were determined in the same feces samples and were found to be 1–7 g/l (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053876-t001">Table 1</xref>), revealing an incomplete absorption of this monosaccharide in the gut. Interestingly, we observed that an equimolar concentration of a combination of glucose and galactose induced <italic>CAMP</italic> gene expression to the same extent as lactose. Furthermore, our results indicate that also maltose induced <italic>CAMP</italic> gene transcript to the same extent as lactose and that trehalose can even surpass lactose in <italic>CAMP</italic> gene-inducing capacity on an equimolar basis.</p>
      <p>Human breast milk provides the infant with nutrients, protective components and immune effectors, defending the infant from infections and promotes the establishment of an optimal normal flora <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Marcobal1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Stockinger1">[35]</xref>. Here we demonstrated a potential additional function of breast milk carbohydrates in inducing the gene expression of <italic>CAMP</italic> and its gene product hCAP-18 (the precursor of the potent AMP LL-37). We also demonstrated that the inducing effect of lactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053876-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>) and galactose (data not shown) was enhanced in the presence of butyrate, an established <italic>CAMP</italic> gene inducer and a product of colonic bacterial fermentation of dietary fibers and lactose.</p>
      <p>AMPs, including LL-37, have been shown to be crucial components in gut homeostasis by eliminating pathogens. In addition, AMPs, e.g., human defensins 5, have been shown to determine the composition of the intestinal microbiota <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Salzman2">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Chu1">[39]</xref>, suggesting that also LL-37 may have this effect. In this study, only the proform hCAP-18 was detected in the supernatants of HT-29 cells stimulated with breast milk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053876-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). However, we have previously demonstrated that the active LL-37 peptide is present in neonatal feces, suggesting a release of this AMP in the neonatal gut <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-KaiLarsen1">[6]</xref>. The expression of AMPs in epithelial cells is regulated by nutrients and microbes, emphasizing the importance of environmental factors in early human intestinal homeostasis. Actually, the onset of AMP expression in the neonatal gut is enhanced in the infant intestine shortly after birth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-KaiLarsen1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Mallow1">[40]</xref>. We hypothesize that lactose- and galactose-mediated induction of the <italic>CAMP</italic> gene is important for establishing surface immune defense in the newborn. Interestingly, human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) have been suggested to harbor prebiotic effects by promoting the establishment of an optimal normal flora <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Bode1">[41]</xref>. HMOs have also been reported as blocking microbial anchoring to host epithelia, but can also affect expression of glycan-induced genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Kuntz1">[42]</xref>. This last function is in line with our results, establishing milk carbohydrates as modulators of AMP expression at the host-microbe interface.</p>
      <p>When we investigated the signaling pathway of lactose-mediated <italic>CAMP</italic> gene induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053876-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>) we observed that pertussis toxin did not inhibit the upregulation, indicating that the lactose mediated induction is not dependent on G-protein coupled receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Deng1">[43]</xref>. The inhibition experiments further suggest that mainly p38, and to some extent JNK pathway, are involved. Known inducers of the p38 and JNK pathways are proinflammatory cytokines, lipopolysaccharide and osmotic shock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Obata1">[44]</xref>. Since osmotic shock may be involved in the pathology of lactose intolerance, it was of relevance to investigate such an effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Vesa1">[45]</xref>.Thus, we stimulated HT-29 cells with equimolar concentrations of either glucose or galactose, resulting in significantly lower induction of <italic>CAMP</italic> gene expression compared to lactose. We also stimulated these cells with equimolar (or higher) concentrations of additional agents that increase the osmolarity, <italic>i.e.</italic> NaCl, KCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053876-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>) without any induction of <italic>CAMP</italic> gene expression. However, as opposed to the impermeant <italic>CAMP</italic>-inducing carbohydrates (trehalose and mannitol), these salts are allowed to enter the cell and may thus stress intracellular systems that are not affected by an impermeant carbohydrate. This makes it difficult to exclude an osmosis-dependent mechanism. Albeit, the differential inducing effects of equimolar concentrations of the impermeant <italic>CAMP</italic>-inducing carbohydrates suggest that additional mechanisms are involved, such as receptor-mediated activation. Furthermore, trehalose has been shown to promote mucin-producing, goblet-like maturation of HT-29 cells that might be involved in the mechanism of carbohydrate-mediated <italic>CAMP</italic>-induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Lu1">[46]</xref>.</p>
      <p>When testing infant formulas of different brands, we found the median level of <italic>CAMP</italic> gene expression was only half of that for mature breast milk (2.2- vs. 3.9-fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053876-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). However, no correlation between formula lactose content and <italic>CAMP</italic> gene induction was observed. An explanation for this might be that infant formulas often contain additives that in themselves can modulate the neonatal immune system. Examples of such milk formula additives are long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Field2">[47]</xref>, nucleotides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Hawkes1">[48]</xref> and probiotics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Weizman1">[49]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Primary lactose intolerance is an inherited trait present in most of the world’s population and is characterized by a gradual decline in lactase level during maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Heyman1">[32]</xref>. However, small bowel injury, such as celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or gastroenteritis can lead to secondary lactose intolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Eadala1">[50]</xref> with reduced lactase activity. Lactose intolerance will lead to an increased concentration of lactose in the colon, resulting in symptoms such as bloating, flatulence and diarrhea. We propose that some of the observed symptoms may in fact be an effect of perturbation of the microflora in response to increased expression of <italic>CAMP</italic> in the colon mediated by lactose. This effect may be further exacerbated by butyrate, an established <italic>CAMP</italic> gene inducer and a product of colonic fermentation of dietary fibers and lactose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-He1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Jiang1">[52]</xref>. It has been established that IBD can be exacerbated by a lactose-rich diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Brown1">[53]</xref>. Our results may be a part of an explanation of these symptoms, since we here demonstrate that lactose is able to induce AMP expression, which has been linked to IBD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Schauber2">[54]</xref>. In addition, the peptides <italic>per se</italic> have in some settings been shown to be pro-inflammatory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Bowdish1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Wan1">[56]</xref>. The ingestion of trehalose may result in diarrhea in patients diagnosed with trehalase deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053876-Murray1">[57]</xref>. This is consistent with the hypothesis that undigested trehalose may disturb the microbial homeostasis of the intestine through increased levels of AMP expression.</p>
      <p>One further implication of our study is related to pharmaceutical products that frequently include lactose as an excipient or in placebo. The presence of lactose in medications might affect the results of the treatments and studies due to the biological effects of lactose that we have here demonstrated.</p>
      <p>We conclude that lactose in human milk stimulates expression of <italic>CAMP</italic> and its gene product hCAP-18 in cell culture, supporting the hypothesis that this dominant milk carbohydrate may play a role in the developing intestinal microbiota and innate immune response of the neonate.</p>
