<abstract>
<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI), often caused by a concussive impact to the head, affects an estimated 1.7 million Americans annually. With no approved drugs, its pharmacological treatment represents a significant and currently unmet medical need. In our prior development of the anti-cholinesterase compound phenserine for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, we recognized that it also possesses non-cholinergic actions with clinical potential. Here, we demonstrate neuroprotective actions of phenserine in neuronal cultures challenged with oxidative stress and glutamate excitotoxicity, two insults of relevance to TBI. These actions translated into amelioration of spatial and visual memory impairments in a mouse model of closed head mild TBI (mTBI) two days following cessation of clinically translatable dosing with phenserine (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg BID x 5 days initiated post mTBI) in the absence of anti-cholinesterase activity. mTBI elevated levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), a marker of oxidative stress. Phenserine counteracted this by augmenting homeostatic mechanisms to mitigate oxidative stress, including superoxide dismutase [SOD] 1 and 2, and glutathione peroxidase [GPx], the activity and protein levels of which were measured by specific assays. Microarray analysis of hippocampal gene expression established that large numbers of genes were exclusively regulated by each individual treatment with a substantial number of them co-regulated between groups. Molecular pathways associated with lipid peroxidation were found to be regulated by mTBI, and treatment of mTBI animals with phenserine effectively reversed injury-induced regulations in the ‘Blalock Alzheimer’s Disease Up’ pathway. Together these data suggest that multiple phenserine-associated actions underpin this compound’s ability to ameliorate cognitive deficits caused by mTBI, and support the further evaluation of the compound as a therapeutic for TBI.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Traumatic brain injury represents a significant and growing cause of disability and death worldwide, and is estimated to become the third largest cause of global disease burden by 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref001">1</xref>]. Every year, some 10 million individuals succumb to TBI events that can be broadly subdivided as either concussive or blast in origin. The former type of TBI is far more common, and is exemplified by events such as automobile accidents, full contact sporting injuries and falls in the young and, particularly, in the elderly. The latter type of TBI, generally resulting from a high-pressure shock wave from an explosive device, are a prevalent form of injury in modern combat arenas that primarily affect servicemen/women and civilians in active war zones. In addition to immediate TBI-induced physical injuries, ensuing secondary damage, and signature cognitive deficits, TBI is increasingly considered to be an important conduit to the development of chronic neurodegenerative disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref002">2</xref>]. In this regard, a strong association between TBI and the onset of dementia-related illness has recently been reported in US military veterans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref004">4</xref>]. This finding is of particular significance in the face of estimates that approximately 15% of all deployed military personnel receive a mild to moderate TBI of one form or another, with the total number of such injuries estimated as high as 320,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref006">6</xref>]. TBI has also been associated with an increased likelihood of Parkinson’s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref007">7</xref>], particularly in the elderly. Within the US alone, it is estimated that at least 1.7 million people suffer a TBI event annually. Studies suggest that every year approximately 235,000 TBI victims require hospitalization that can, in the most severe instances, result in some 50,000 deaths annually. Indeed, at least 5.3 million Americans are presently believed to be living with long-term disabilities associated with a TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref008">8</xref>], for which there is currently no effective pharmacological treatment.</p>
<p>Neurological sequelae of TBI events include shearing and compression of neuronal and vascular tissue that, in turn, initiate a secondary cascade of pathological events that cause further brain injury. Secondary injury to brain tissues may be amenable to therapeutic intervention. Irrespective of the type of injury, mild to moderate TBI can lead to headaches, sleep disorders, and significant impairments across a broad range of brain functions such as attention, cognition, emotion and social behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref010">10</xref>]. Clinical and experimental research suggests that mTBI-induced cognitive changes may be derived from learning and memory deficits caused by damage to the hippocampus and hippocampal-dependent functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref012">12</xref>] from oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, ischemia, neuronal degeneration, elevated excitatory neurotransmitters (e.g., glutamate excitotoxicity), loss or disruption of synaptic connections, or altered synaptic physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate the health and survival of neurons in neurodegenerative conditions has allowed identification of key biochemical cascades linked to neuronal dysfunction and cellular demise that may be amenable to pharmacologic intervention. Our prior studies using pharmacological tools, such as anti-apoptotic p53 inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref019">19</xref>], indicate that neuronal cell death occurring in the secondary phase of injury can be halted to thereby mitigate cognitive deficits; however, such agents are not readily clinically translatable. In contrast, clinically translatable drugs focused towards mechanisms shared between neurodegenerative disorders and TBI have yet to provide unequivocal efficacy profiles supportive of clinical approval.</p>
<p>Studies of experimental TBI models as well as post mortem human TBI samples have demonstrated losses in key features of the cholinergic system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref023">23</xref>]. Cholinesterase inhibitors have, for example, been appraised in preclinical and clinical TBI studies, but have generated largely mixed results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref029">29</xref>]. Paradoxically, rapid elevations in acetylcholine (ACh) levels within CSF of animal models and humans have been reported following TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref033">33</xref>], with higher levels associated with greater injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref034">34</xref>]. This trend supported the early experimental and clinical use of anticholinergic agents, particularly muscarinic antagonists, for the mitigation of ACh-related toxicity to ameliorate TBI-induced deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref039">39</xref>].</p>
<p>In the present study we evaluated the actions of an experimental and reversible anti-acetylcholinesterase (AChE) agent, (-)-phenserine tartrate (phenserine) in a well-characterized mild concussive model of TBI in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref043">43</xref>]. Notably, in addition to its anti-AChE activity, phenserine is able to inhibit the synthesis of amyloid precursor protein and alpha-synuclein, proteins of relevance to the pathology of AD and PD, respectively, but of currently unknown relevance to TBI. In addition, phenserine possesses anti-inflammatory properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref044">44</xref>], a phenomenon of significance in TBI, although the majority of anti-inflammatory approaches have failed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref045">45</xref>].</p>
<p>We now report that mTBI-induced deficits in two common measures of rodent cognition were substantially ameliorated by the acute systemic administration of phenserine for 5 days, when initiated shortly following induction of TBI. These actions on cognition were non-cholinergically mediated and not symptomatic, as they were assessed 2 days following phenserine treatment cessation and washout. In addition to animal behavioral testing, we undertook cellular studies focused on insults known to be involved in TBI (oxidative stress and glutamate excitotoxicity), as well as biochemical and transcriptomic analyses of hippocampal tissue in order to gain insight into the molecular elements involved in mTBI-induced cognitive deficits, as well as those that may be involved in the phenserine-induced attenuation of these deficits.</p>

<p>Cell viability was evaluated either by the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) -5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl) -2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay or by the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. For the MTS assay, studies were performed in 96-well plates, and cells were serum-deprived (with 0.5% of serum) overnight before pretreatment with phenserine or vehicle for 1 h. Thereafter, cells were exposed to different concentrations of glutamate or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 24 h, the doses of which were selected from prior experiments to attain a significant but sub-maximal cellular loss within the linear portion of the dose-response curve of each (data not shown). A CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) was utilized to measure a formazan product, which is directly proportional to the cell viability. For the LDH assay, studies were performed in 24-well plates, and cells were pretreated with phenserine for 1 h prior to glutamate exposure for 24 h. Samples of conditioned media were collected for quantification of LDH levels (LDH Cytotoxicity Assay Kit, Cayman Chemical), which is an indicator of plasma membrane integrity and cell viability.</p>

<title>Induction of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)</title>
<p>Experimental mTBI was induced using the concussive, closed-scalp head trauma device described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref042">42</xref>]. Mice were anesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane in a closed chamber and placed under a metal tube device where the opening was positioned directly over the animal’s head just anterior to the right ear. The animals were held in a manner such that the force of impact to the skull generated anterio-lateral movements without any rotational movements, analogous to those that occur during closed head injury in automobile accidents. The injury was induced by dropping a blunted cylindrical metal weight (30 g), inside the metal tube device (inner diameter 13 mm) from a height of 80 cm. Mice were placed back in their home cage to allow for recovery from the anesthesia and mTBI, immediately following the induction of the injury. Evaluation of body temperature prior to and following mTBI demonstrated no statistically significant change across groups. The potential effects of the weight drop injury were studied 7 days following the trauma. Each mouse was used in a single experiment and for one time point only. Sham control animals were subjected to the same procedure, but without the weight being dropped. Groups of animals were subjected to mTBI or sham procedure, administered either phenserine tartrate or vehicle, and then examined in behavioral or biochemical studies in parallel, as described below.</p>

<sec id="sec008">
<title>Drug treatments</title>
<p>Mice were given a 5-day regimen of either phenserine tartrate (2.5 or 5.0 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.) in 0.1 ml/10 g body weight) or vehicle (physiological saline) injections, twice daily (every 12 hr.), with the first injection administered 30 min after injury.</p>

<sec id="sec011">
<title>Novel object recognition (NOR) paradigm</title>
<p>This task was used to evaluate visual recognition memory, as previously described for mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref047">47</xref>], and is based on the innate tendency of rodents to explore new objects within their environment. Assessment of this natural tendency enables a determination of whether an animal is able to discriminate between a familiar object and a novel one. Mice were individually habituated to an open field plexiglass box (59 × 59 × 20 cm size) for 5 min, 48 h prior to the test. During the acquisition phases, two identical objects (termed A and B) were placed in symmetrical positions within the arena, and animals were allowed to explore the environment for 5 min. These objects were suitably heavy and high to guarantee that mice could neither move nor climb over them. Twenty-four hours following this acquisition phase of training, one of the objects (either A or B, randomly) was replaced with a novel one (C), and the animal’s exploratory behavior was again evaluated over 5 min. Exploration of an object was defined as rearing on the object or sniffing it at a distance of less than 2 cm and/or touching it by nose. Successful recognition was manifested by the preferential exploration of the novel object. A discrimination preference index was determined as follows: (time near the new object -time near the old object)/(time near the new object + time near the old object) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref012">12</xref>]. Following each session, all objects were cleaned with 70% ethanol to avoid odor recognition.</p>

<sec id="sec012">
<title>Y maze paradigm</title>
<p>This test was chosen to assess spatial memory. The Y maze was comprised of three identical arms separated by 120° angles and built from black plexiglass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref043">43</xref>]. Each arm was 8 × 30 × 15 cm in dimension and differed from one another solely by the presence of different visual cues (a triangle, square, or a circle). One arm was randomly selected as the “start” arm. On the first trial, lasting for 5 min, each mouse was placed into the start arm and one of the two remaining arms was randomly blocked to limit access. In contrast, during the second trial, lasting for 2 min, all arms of the maze were accessible. These two trials were separated by a 2 min interval, during which the mouse was returned to its home cage. The time spent in each of the arms was quantified during the two trial periods. Between trials, the maze was cleansed using a 70% ethanol solution and was then dried to avoid odor recognition. A discrimination preference index was adopted from Dix and Aggleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref012">12</xref>] as follows: (time in the new arm—time within the familiar arm)/(time in the new arm + time within the familiar arm).</p>

<title>Oxidative stress evaluation in brain</title>
<p>Markers associated with oxidative stress were evaluated within hippocampal tissue obtained from the side of the concussive injury on Days 5- and 14-post injury. Frozen tissue was weighed, placed in 9 volumes of phosphate buffered saline and sonicated (4°C). A portion of each sample was separated for measurement of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and the remainder was ultracentrifuged (100,000 x g for 60 min, 4°C [Optima TLX Ultracentrifuge, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA]) for other analyses.</p>

<title>Measurement of anti-oxidative enzyme activity</title>
<p>Quantification of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was performed using a SOD determination kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. This method is based on the xanthine oxidase reaction, which induces superoxide. Nitroblue tetrazolium reacts with superoxide and is reduced to diformazan. In the presence of SOD, however, superoxide reacts with SOD and results in production of hydrogen peroxide, causing a consequential decline in diformazan generation. In this assay, SOD activity is expressed as the ratio of decreased diformazan, and was determined at a 440 nm wavelength absorbance by a microplate reader (xMark Microplate Absorbance Spectrophotometer, Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA).</p>
<p>Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity was determined by monitoring β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) levels by use of a commercial kit (Glutathione peroxidase cellular activity assay kit, Sigma-Aldrich) following the manufacture's protocol. Samples were mixed with reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione reductase (GR), and NADPH, and then rapidly incubated with <italic>tert</italic>-butyl hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide is reduced by GPx, while GSH is oxidized to glutathione (GSSG). GR reduces GSSG to GSH and concomitantly oxidizes NADPH to NADP+. Consequent reductions in levels of NADPH were measured at a 340 nm absorbance every 10 s for 10 min. SOD and GPx activities were expressed in units of activity per mg protein within the samples.</p>

<title>Measurement of antioxidant protein expression</title>
<p>Part of the ultracentrifuge supernatant was separated into a second tube and added to radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA)-buffer (Boston Bioproducts, Inc., Ashland, MA) with protease inhibitors (Protease Inhibitors Cocktail 1, 2 and 3; phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride [Sigma Aldrich]). LDS sample buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was added and incubated for 5 min at 95°C. The samples (10 μg) were loaded into polyacrylamide 10–20% gradient gels (Criterion TGX Precast Gels, Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories) using the Trans-Blot Turbo (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The transferred membranes were stained with Ponceau S solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min and washed with 1% acetic acid. Images of the membranes were taken (Amersham Imager 600, GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). Ponceau S staining was used for normalization of each specific protein expression. The membranes were washed in PBS containing 0.5% tween-20 (PBS-T) and incubated in blocking solution (PBS-T containing 5% non-fat milk) for 1 h at room temperature (R/T). The membranes were then probed with antibodies specific for the following proteins: anti-superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1 (#ab13498, 1:2000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), SOD 2 (#ab13533, 1:2000, Abcam), glutathione peroxidase (GPx)1 (#ab22604, 1:1000, Abcam); overnight at 4°C respectively. Bovine anti-rabbit HRP conjugated antibody was used as a secondary antibody at 1:5000 dilution for 1 h at R/T. Chemiluminescent signals were generated by incubation with the detection reagents (ECL Prime Western Blotting Analysis Reagent; GE Healthcare) according to the manufacture’s procedure. The intensities of Ponceau S, SOD1, SOD2 and GPx1 were quantified by ImageJ software (ImageJ 1.48v, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Expression ratios were calculated by dividing the SOD1, SOD2 and GPx-1 density values by those of the Ponceau S.</p>

<title>Gene expression microarray analysis</title>
<p>In the present study we chose to examine hippocampal tissue gene expressions due to the relevance of the hippocampus in learning and memory, its vulnerability to mild concussive TBI, and due to evidence of mTBI-induced hippocampal cell degeneration in this model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref048">48</xref>]. Hippocampal tissue gene expression was assessed on Day 14 post injury on the side of the concussive injury in a series of experiments parallel to the behavioral studies. The mouse treatment groups utilized in the gene expression studies: sham (n = 5), phenserine (PHEN) no injury (n = 5), mTBI (n = 5), and mTBI/PHEN (n = 5).</p>
<p>Extraction of total RNA from hippocampal tissue has been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref050">50</xref>]. Total RNA was quality-controlled using the Agilent Bioanalyzer RNA 6000 Chip (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and labeled using the Illumina® TotalPrep<sup>TM</sup> RNA amplification kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Illumina SentrixMouse Ref-8, v2 Expression BeadChips (Illumina, San Diego, CA) were hybridized overnight using 750 ng biotinylated aRNA and following posthybridization washes incubated with streptavidin-conjugated Cy3 and scanned at a resolution of 0.54 μm using the iScan array scanner from Illumina. Hybridization data were extracted from the intensity images using Illumina GenomeStudio software, V2011.1.</p>
<p>Hippocampal gene expression profile comparisons were made between the following mouse treatment data sets: mTBI; mTBI/PHEN and PHEN all vs. sham. Bioinformatic methods used were as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref050">50</xref>]. In brief, raw array chip hybridization image signals were processed to generate normalized data that was then transformed to create Z-scores for each gene. The Z-score transformed data was then utilized to generate a Z-ratio measurement, which allowed for the statistical analysis of the gene expression data sets. We selected significant genes using the following criteria: 1) gene expression changes that had a z-test p value of ≤ 0.05 vs. the control comparison group; 2) the absolute value of Z-ratio was calculated to be ≥ 1.5 vs. the control comparison group; 3) the False Discovery Rate for the genes was ≤ 0.30; 4) the average Z-score over all sample comparisons were not negative and lastly; 5) a one way independent ANOVA test on the sample group p value cut off was ≤ 0.05. Only genes that consistently displayed significant expression changes in all samples from a given treatment group were considered for further statistical analysis. The relationships of significantly regulated genes identified in the various group comparisons are illustrated by Venn Diagram; details of the genes are provided in a supplemental table (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156493.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Where PHEN treated mTBI animal Z-score and Z-ratio data were compared with mTBI vs. sham data for individual genes or gene sets (i.e. ontology or pathways), values that are illustrated in graphical format are represented as an overall geometric average change in gene/gene set regulation between treatment groups. All data sets underwent Parametric Analysis of Gene set Enrichment analysis (PAGE, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref051">51</xref>]) for Gene Ontology. Regulation of canonical and non-canonical pathways was assessed by use of Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Ingenuity Systems, Inc.

<p>In light of the extensive evidence supporting the role of oxidative damage in neuronal cell death induced by TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref054">54</xref>], markers of oxidative stress (TBARS) and homeostatic mechanisms to mitigate oxidative stress (SOD and GPx) were evaluated in hippocampal tissue ipsilateral to mTBI at 5 and 14 days post injury. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156493.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, unaltered across groups at 5 days, a significant elevation in TBARS, indicative of lipid peroxidation, was evident in untreated mTBI mice at 14 days post mTBI (142.7% of the control value, p≤0.01).

<p>As a counter measure to oxidative stress, endogenous SOD activity/mg was quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156493.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) and found maintained at control levels across all groups at 5 days. When evaluated at 14 days, however, an elevation in SOD activity was induced by phenserine treatment in sham animals (139.9% of the control value, p≤0.001) and SOD activity was more substantially elevated in untreated and, in particular, in phenserine treated mTBI groups (232.2% and 263.5% of the control value, respectively, p≤0.001). The levels of the endogenous antioxidant enzymes SOD1 and SOD2 were measured to define the protein amount available within the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156493.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>). The levels of both SOD1 and SOD2 were significantly reduced in untreated mTBI-challenged mice at 5 days (30.3% and 23.0% lower than sham control values, respectively, p≤0.05), with the former likewise being significantly lower than phenserine treated mTBI mice (p≤0.05). These had returned to control levels when evaluated on day 14. By contrast, both phenserine treated sham and mTBI groups possessed SOD1 and SOD2 amounts similar to control values at both 5 and 14 days.</p>
<p>As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156493.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, GPx activity/mg was significantly elevated at day 5 in both untreated and phenserine-treated mTBI groups (168.9% (p≤0.05) and 188.4% (p≤0.001) of the control value, respectively) and, notably, was elevated within the phenserine only sham group (195.7% of control value (p≤0.01), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156493.g003">Fig 3C</xref>).

Interestingly the largest numbers of genes were observed to be exclusively regulated by each individual treatment comparison with the sham group. The fold changes in transcripts detected in our hippocampal samples were relatively small. The two most highly regulated gene transcripts identified in our arrays, induced by mTBI were as follows: <italic>Cox6a2</italic>, which had a fold change of +2.01 and Z-ratio of +8.48.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The incidences of mTBI or concussion are common events and impact approximately 42 million people worldwide each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref007">7</xref>]. Though moderate and severe TBI are established risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia, Parkinson’s Disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref057">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref059">59</xref>], mTBI has not previously been considered an important risk factor for these disorders. Recent large-scale epidemiological studies, however, have reported that mTBI, which represents the vast majority of TBIs (90%), is actually a significant risk factor in the development of neurodegenerative disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref060">60</xref>]. Moreover, in the short term, mTBI can cause headaches and meaningful deficits across a wide range of brain functions such as sleep, memory, attention and cognitive processes. mTBI can also cause affective disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref009">9</xref>]. Such symptoms, which are reported in up to 70% of cases, occur in the absence of overt histological or standard clinical radiological evidence of damage, and may resolve or persist long after injury occurrence. To date, there is no approved drug for the treatment of TBI, despite the evaluation of a broad number of drug classes focused on a range of different mechanisms pertinent to TBI. As a consequence, the effective pharmacological treatment of TBI represents a current and significant unmet medical need. In the present study, we demonstrate that the experimental AD drug phenserine possesses neuroprotective actions in cortical cell cultures challenged with oxidative stress and glutamate excitotoxicity, two insults implicated in the pathogenesis of a wide number of acute and chronic neurological disorders, including TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref061">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref063">63</xref>]. Notably, these neuroprotective actions translated significantly into the amelioration of cognitive impairments in a murine, closed-head model of concussive mTBI. Biochemical and gene array evaluation of hippocampal tissue ipsilateral to injury indicated that multiple cellular and molecular processes may underpin the beneficial actions of phenserine in mTBI.</p>
<p>Previous preclinical and clinical studies evaluating a number of anti-cholinesterases in TBI have provided ambiguous results, with some studies reporting improvements and others reporting no activity or further deterioration of cognitive measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref026">26</xref>]. An association between TBI and alterations in cholinergic system function was proposed more than 70 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref030">30</xref>]. More recent research indicates that the impact of experimental TBI on cholinergic markers is both diverse and time-dependent. Immediately following TBI (12 min to 4 hr) a marked rise in ACh release and its turnover rate have been described in key cholinergic brain areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref064">64</xref>]. The changes are likely induced by mechanical forces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref065">65</xref>]. Declines in the activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref066">66</xref>] as well as the density of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (vAChT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref067">67</xref>] have been described within 1 to 2 hr of insult. Reductions in the density of muscarinic and nicotinic ACh receptors have been reported to persist from 2 to 72 hr across cholinergic regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref065">65</xref>], particularly nicotinic α7 receptors that are reportedly decreased within the hippocampus by as much as 50% from 1 hr up to 21 days after TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref067">67</xref>]. Changes in AChE activity have also been characterized, and appear to be both regional and time-dependent. AChE activity increases following TBI in the basal forebrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref068">68</xref>], an area not only notable for its abundance of cholinergic neurons, but also for its role as the origin of the cholinergic innervation to the hippocampus and cortex as well. In contrast, AChE activity is reportedly reduced within these projection areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref068">68</xref>]. Reports of cholinergic neuron loss within both the basal forebrain and hippocampus following TBI have been described in rodents and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref069">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref071">71</xref>]. Due to the complex time- and regional-dependent changes in cholinergic function evident in brain following a TBI, and the negative effects on cognitive performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref072">72</xref>] caused by early use of anticholinergics, primarily muscarinic antagonists, to potentially mitigate neurological deficits associated with TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref073">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref074">74</xref>], we evaluated the actions of phenserine following a two day washout when cholinergic actions were no longer present, eliminating potential confounding factors.</p>
<p>The action of phenserine was evaluated in a well-characterized mouse mTBI model following two clinically translatable doses of the drug (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg, BID x 5 days) initiated shortly following injury. These doses are approximately equivalent to 12 and 24 mg in a 60 kg human, following body surface area normalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref075">75</xref>]. This model involves a concussive impact with a weight equivalent to that of the animal (30 g), and parallels collisions and falls in humans, which entail the weight of the victim. Increases in markers of apoptosis (p53, Bax, apoptosis inducing factor [AIF]) have been described in this model, along with some diffuse neuronal loss and neuroinflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref076">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref077">77</xref>]. Behavioral evaluation of animals subjected to mTBI was undertaken at 7 days onwards after injury, in accord with previous time-dependent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref077">77</xref>]. The assessed behavior involved (i) recognition memory assessed by the classical novel object recognition paradigm and, (ii), spatial memory evaluated by the Y-maze paradigm, both of which were impaired by mTBI in prior studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref078">78</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref080">80</xref>]. The former refers to the ability to discriminate a previously-encountered (familiar) item from a novel one. This task has become a valuable tool in basic and preclinical research for investigating the neural basis of memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref081">81</xref>], and has parallels to visual paired-comparison task studies in humans and monkeys. Damage to the hippocampus is sufficient to produce impaired recognition memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref082">82</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref084">84</xref>]. The latter task, spontaneous spatial memory in the Y-maze, is likewise considered a hippocampal-dependent test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref084">84</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref085">85</xref>]. Importantly, both recognition and spatial memory are impaired in humans with mTBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref086">86</xref>]. The hippocampus appears to be particularly vulnerable to mTBI-induced neuronal degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref076">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref087">87</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref088">88</xref>].</p>
<p>Analyses of gene expression profiles from affected brain areas in animal concussive mTBI models implicates the involvement of multiple pathways, including those associated with chronic neurodegenerative disorders, epitomized by Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref050">50</xref>]. The transcriptome analysis in the current study, likewise, demonstrated multiple gene changes induced by mTBI, phenserine and mTBI/phenserine vs. sham controls, many of which were exclusively regulated by the treatment and many others that were co-regulated. Interestingly, the mTBI/phenserine group displayed the largest numbers of both exclusively regulated as well as co-regulated genes. Two of the genes induced by mTBI that were validated by q-RT-PCR are associated with CNS disorders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156493.g006">Fig 6</xref>). <italic>Fos</italic> and <italic>Arc</italic> are linked to schizophrenia, audiogenic seizures, Alzheimer’s disease and autistic syndromes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref089">89</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref091">91</xref>].</p>
<p>In relation to Gene Ontologies, beyond the previously described disruptions to cholinergic signaling and function that are found in TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref092">92</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref093">93</xref>], implicated in AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref094">94</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref095">95</xref>], and associated with amyloid, tau and neuroinflammatory hypotheses in AD progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref096">96</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref098">98</xref>], numerous other systems are implicated. Prominent among these systems are the dopaminergic system (with induced changes in dopamine receptor binding [GO0050780], signaling [GO0007212] and activity [GO0004952]), the glutamatergic system (with induced changes in extracellular glutamate gated ion channels [GO0005234] and ionotropic glutamate receptor activity [GO0004970]) and the axonogenesis system [GO0007409]. Interestingly, learning and/or memory [GO0007611] was up regulated in the phenserine sham group, in accordance with the compound’s actions in rodents, canines and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref099">99</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref101">101</xref>].</p>
<p>Pathway analyses demonstrated the involvement of multiple physiological cascades. Many are related to CNS and neuronal systems with many more diverse pathway regulations, including lipid peroxidation, a pathological process identified in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156493.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). As was observed in a prior study, mTBI-induced regulations in several pathways are associated with CNS and neurodegenerative processes and disorders, namely Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref049">49</xref>]. The findings in the present study extend and confirm these observations with similar Alzheimer’s-related pathways. These pathways were observed to be derived from significantly regulated genes identified in the hippocampal tissue RNA samples. A key pathway of note here is ‘Blalock Alzheimers Disease Up’, which was down regulated by mTBI and oppositely regulated by treatment with phenserine. The identification of mTBI regulated genes in this pathway that were further regulated by treatment with phenserine will provide a focus for further studies to highlight potential proteins of relevance to disease pathology and targets for drug development. It would be interesting to follow phenserine treated mTBI animals for a substantially longer duration in future studies in light of epidemiological studies in humans finding increased risks of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia in those following a head injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref102">102</xref>]</p>
<p>At the cellular level, phenserine protected immortal human SH-SY5Y neuronal cells from oxidative stress, and rodent primary cortical neurons from both oxidative stress and glutamate excitotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156493.g001">Fig 1</xref>). These results are in line with previous studies demonstrating the neuroprotective actions of both phenserine and its cholinergically inert enantiomer Posiphen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref103">103</xref>], and appear to be mediated via the PKC and ERK pathways. Likewise at a cellular level, there is substantial cross-talk between the cholinergic and glutaminergic systems. Glutamatergic neurons in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, amygdala and reticular formation form synaptic connections with cholinergic neurons localized within the nucleus basalis of Meynert, the medial septum and diagonal band of Broca. In turn, these cholinergic neurons innervate the hippocampus and neocortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref104">104</xref>]. Glutamatergic signaling has been shown to modulate acetylcholine release, predominantly via the ionotropic <italic>N</italic>-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref105">105</xref>], and some cholinergic basal forebrain neurons appear to release both ACh and glutamate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref106">106</xref>]. During normal physiological conditions, NMDA receptor channels are blocked by Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions. Following a transient glutamate synaptic signal, depolarization of the post-synaptic membrane occurs by release of the voltage-dependent Mg<sup>2+</sup> channel block to permit Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into the post-synaptic neuron and the triggering of a signaling cascade to induce synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation (LTP) to ultimately augment executive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref104">104</xref>]. NMDA receptor over-activation by excessive glutamate, as is considered to occur in TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref017">17</xref>], leads to sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and overload, and generates excitotoxicity—producing neuronal dysfunction and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref104">104</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref105">105</xref>] to ultimately impact both cholinergic and glutaminergic pathways regulating cognitive functioning. Our cellular studies demonstrate that phenserine mitigates glutamate excitotoxicity to reduce neuronal cell death. Our gene expression studies suggest that phenserine favorably impacts glutamate gated ion channels and glutamate receptor activity at a number of levels in vivo. In addition, it has been reported that physostigmine, for which phenserine bears structural similarity, and select other anticholinesterases have NMDA antagonist activity at albeit it non-clinically relevant concentrations in the order of 50 μM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref107">107</xref>]. Further focused studies would be required to define Phenserine mediated mechanism(s) that underpin its neuroprotective actions at the level of glutamate excitotoxicity.</p>
<p>Our analysis of hippocampal tissue from mice suggests that oxidative stress, particularly lipid peroxidation as evaluated by increased levels of TBARS, has a role in mTBI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156493.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), which is consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref108">108</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref109">109</xref>]. Aberrant changes in mitochondrial function, which include suppression of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, elevation in reactive oxygen species, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and impaired calcium buffering, have been reported to play critical roles in initiating post-injury neuronal dysfunction and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref110">110</xref>]. Augmentation of antioxidant mechanisms, particularly endogenous pathways, is reported to mitigate ensuing neuronal dysfunction and neuroinflammation in not only TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref111">111</xref>], but also in other neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref112">112</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref113">113</xref>]. The ability of phenserine to augment the actions of SOD1, SOD2 and GPx <italic>in vivo</italic> may, in part, underlie its favorable actions in mTBI.</p>
<p>Although anticholinesterases have previously been appraised in TBI with variable efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref114">114</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref115">115</xref>], often within a narrow and not readily translatable dose range for human use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref116">116</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref118">118</xref>], the reversible AChE inhibitor phenserine warrants further evaluation due to its promising actions in the described animal model of concussive head injury that bears face validity to the human condition. Phenserine combines cholinergic actions with valuable non-cholinergic actions; the latter being evaluated following a 2 day drug washout period (in excess of 5 half-lives of the agent’s pharmacokinetic and anticholinesterase actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref119">119</xref>]) to ensure that cholinergic symptomatic actions were not a caveat in evaluating the protection provided by phenserine against mTBI-induced cognitive deficits. Prior experimental and clinical studies with anti-inflammatory, cholinergic and other drugs working via a single mechanism only, may have failed to address the full range of pathologies that lead to neuronal loss and cognitive impairment in TBI and other disorders. Phenserine surprisingly benefits multiple pathways, including the augmentation of endogenous antioxidant, neurotrophic, neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, pro-angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref103">103</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref120">120</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref122">122</xref>], as well as cholinergic ones and likely others, too, that provide neuroprotection across animal models, as epitomized by models of nerve gas poisoning and AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref121">121</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref123">123</xref>]. Furthermore, the ability of phenserine to lower amyloid precursor protein and alpha-synuclein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref123">123</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref125">125</xref>] may be beneficial in relation to TBI-induced pathways that increase the risk for subsequent neurodegenerative disorders. The uncovering of these multiple activities of phenserine over many years illustrates how initial impressions of a drug may mislead investigators away from an agent’s full range of benefits to human health. Phenserine has proven to be well tolerated in humans both acutely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref126">126</xref>] and chronically, as assessed in Phase 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref127">127</xref>] and 3 clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref101">101</xref>] for the treatment of AD. It favorably impacts a number of processes instigated by TBI as well as mechanisms that promote neurorepair for which gaps remain in our knowledge as to how these could be safely and beneficially regulated by other clinically translatable drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156493.ref128">128</xref>], and hence (-)-phenserine warrants further assessment as a new treatment strategy for TBI.</p>
