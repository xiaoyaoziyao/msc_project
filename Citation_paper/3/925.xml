<title>Background &amp; Aims</title>
<p>We previously demonstrated the pro-metastasis effect of sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is mediated by down-regulation of tumor suppressor <italic>HTATIP2</italic>. The aim of the present study was to determine whether aspirin minimizes this effect and improves survival.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The effects of sorafenib, aspirin, and combined sorafenib and aspirin were observed in HCCLM3 and HepG2 xenograft nude mice. Tumor growth, intrahepatic metastasis (IHM), lung metastasis, and survival were assessed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array, real-time (RT)-PCR, and Western blotting were used to examine gene expression. The anti-invasion and anti-metastasis effects of aspirin were studied in <italic>HTATIP2</italic>-knockdown and <italic>HTATIP2</italic>-overexpressing HCC cell lines. The molecular mechanism of <italic>HTATIP2</italic> regulation by aspirin was explored.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Aspirin suppressed the pro-invasion and pro-metastasis effects of sorafenib in HCC and up-regulated <italic>HTATIP2</italic> expression. Aspirin did not inhibit the proliferation of HCC cells, but it decreased the invasiveness of HCC with lower expression of <italic>HTATIP2</italic> and increased expression of a set of markers, indicating a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition in tumor cells. The up-regulation of <italic>HTATPI2</italic> expression by aspirin is most likely mediated through inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) 2 expression.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Aspirin minimized the pro-metastasis effect of sorafenib by up-regulating the tumor suppressor <italic>HTATIP2</italic>; this mechanism is mediated through inhibition of COX2.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth-most common cancer and the third-most common cause of cancer death worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Parkin1">[1]</xref>. Because of late diagnosis, most HCC patients are not candidates for radical therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Poon1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Tang1">[3]</xref>. Sorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has become the first-line therapy for advanced HCC. However, sorafenib prolongs patients’ median survival time by less than 3 months; many patients have to reduce their dosage or discontinue drug therapy because of its adverse effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Llovet1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Cheng1">[5]</xref>. Although the literature contains no reports of HCC outcomes after discontinuation of sorafenib, rebound of tumor growth has been reported for other cancers or after discontinuation of other angiogenesis inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Desar1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Ebos1">[10]</xref>. Preclinical studies demonstrated that, in some situations, anti-angiogenesis drugs may promote metastasis in addition to inhibiting the primary tumor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Ebos1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-PaezRibes1">[11]</xref>. Our previous study confirmed that sorafenib promotes invasiveness and metastasis of HCC in xenograft models, as indicated by increased intrahepatic metastasis (IHM), lung metastasis, and circulating tumor cells of tumors with higher expression of <italic>HTATIP2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Zhang1">[12]</xref>. Because sorafenib is the only approved molecular-target drug for HCC, there is an urgent need for a therapeutic approach that overcomes these adverse effects to improve sorafenib’s efficacy.</p>
<p>Aspirin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is widely used as an antipyretic and analgesic and to treat rheumatism and prevent cardiovascular disease. Recently, its therapeutic and prophylactic effects with regard to malignant tumors have been of interest to us <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Rothwell1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Holmes1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study, we found that aspirin minimized the pro-invasion and pro-metastasis effects of sorafenib. This synergistic anti-tumor effect can be attributed to up-regulation of <italic>HTATIP2</italic>.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Cell Culture and Transfection</title>
<p>Six human HCC cell lines were used, including HCCLM3-wt (HCCLM3 without modification, Liver Cancer Institute, Fudan University <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Li1">[20]</xref>), HepG2-wt (HepG2 without modification, Shanghai Institute of Cell Biology), and cell lines derived from HCCLM3-wt and HepG2-wt. HCCLM3-LV-shHTATIP2 and HCCLM3-LV-shNon cells were obtained by infecting HCCLM3-wt cells with lentiviral vectors (LVs) encoding shRNA for <italic>HTATIP2</italic> (LV-shHTATIP2) to eliminate its expression; LV-shNon (transfected with a vector) was a control. HepG2-LV-HTATIP2 and HepG2-LV-Non cells were constructed by LV-HTATIP2 or LV-GFP infection of HepG2-wt cells, which were gifts from Guo and Zhao’s laboratory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Zhao1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Zhao2">[22]</xref>.

<title>Animal Models and Treatments</title>
<p>Male, 6-week-old BALBc nu/nu mice were obtained from the Shanghai Institute of Material Medica, Chinese Academy of Science. All mice were bred in laminar flow cabinets under specific pathogen-free conditions. The experimental protocol was approved by the Shanghai Medical Experimental Animal Care Committee. HCCLM3-wt, HCCLM3-LV-shHTATIP2, HepG2-wt, and HepG2-LV-HTATIP2 cells (1×10<sup>7</sup>) were subcutaneously inoculated into the right flanks of the nude mice. After 3–4 weeks, non-necrotic tumor tissue was cut into 1-mm<sup>3</sup> pieces and orthotopically implanted into the liver. In the survival observation group, treatment was started 2 weeks after orthotopic implantation of the tumor until they died, and mice were randomly assigned to 4 groups (n = 10 for each group), which received a daily oral dose of vehicle solution (control group), 30 mg/kg sorafenib, 15 mg/kg aspirin, or 30 mg/kg sorafenib and 15 mg/kg aspirin. Another 4 groups (n = 6 mice in each group) received the same dosages, but for 4 weeks, and tumor samples were then extracted for further analysis.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Drugs and Reagents</title>
<p>Sorafenib (Bayer Healthcare) was prepared as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Zhang2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Chang1">[24]</xref>. Briefly, for the in vivo study, sorafenib was formulated at 4 times the highest dose in a Cremophor EL/ethanol (50∶50) solution. This ×4 stock solution was prepared daily. Final dosing solutions were prepared on the day of use by diluting the stock solution to ×1 with endotoxin-free distilled water (Life Technologies) and mixing it by vortexing immediately before dosing. Sorafenib was finally prepared as a ×1 solution with Cremophor EL/ethanol/water (12.5∶12.5∶75, the vehicle solution). For in vitro studies, sorafenib was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, and the final concentration was 5 µmol/L. Aspirin (Sigma; St. Louis, MO), FR122047 (an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase [COX] 1; Tocris Bioscience, Bristol), and NS-398 (an inhibitor of COX2; Sigma; St. Louis, MO) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide for further experiments. The concentration of aspirin used in in vitro studies was 0.1–10 mmol/L. The concentration of FR122047 and NS-398 used in in vitro studies was 30 µmol/L and 50 µmol/L, respectively.</p>

<title>Detection of Metastasis by Hematoxylin-eosin Staining</title>
<p>Tumors were excised and their largest (<italic>a</italic>) and smallest (<italic>b</italic>) diameters were measured to calculate tumor volume, <italic>V</italic> = <italic>ab</italic><sup>2</sup>/2. The excised tumors and lungs were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections were cut at 5 µm for histologic study. For each mouse, 30 intermittently selected sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined for the presence of intrahepatic metastasis (IHM) and lung metastasis. Two pathologists who were blinded to the groups independently evaluated the number of metastatic nodules. The standardized number of lung metastases (SNLM) was increased when the number of lung metastases was standardized by liver tumor size.</p>

<title>1. Aspirin Suppressed the Pro-invasion and Pro-metastasis Effects of Sorafenib in HCC</title>
<p>In both the HCCLM3-wt model and the HepG2-wt model, sorafenib (30 mg·kg<sup>−1</sup>·d<sup>−1</sup>) prolonged survival and decreased tumor volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065023-g001">Figure 1</xref> A,B). However, in the HCCLM3-wt model, the number of IHM was increased in the sorafenib group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065023-g001">Figure 1</xref> C,E,F), which is in accordance with the previous result. Moreover, although there were fewer lung metastases in the sorafenib-treated mice, the standardized number of lung metastases (SNLM) was greater when the number of lung metastases was standardized by liver tumor size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065023-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). In the HepG2-wt model, sorafenib did not promote invasion and metastasis compared with untreated tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065023-g001">Figure 1</xref> C,E). When tumors were treated with a combination of aspirin and sorafenib, the median survival was longer compared to that of the sorafenib group, in both the HCCLM3-wt model and the HepG2-wt model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065023-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), and the number of IHM was significantly less compared to the sorafenib group in the HCCLM3-wt model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065023-g001">Figure 1C,E,F</xref>), and tumor margins were clearer than in the sorafenib group in the HepG2-wt model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065023-g001">Figure 1</xref> C,E).

<title>Aspirin suppressed the pro-invasion and pro-metastasis effects of sorafenib in orthotopic HCC models.</title>
<p>(A) Median survival was improved by sorafenib treatment with or without aspirin in orthotopic HCCLM3 and HepG2 models. Moreover, sorafenib combined with aspirin significantly prolonged median survival compared to sorafenib alone (98.5±3.85 days vs 81.0±4.31 days in the HCCLM3-wt model, <italic>P = </italic>0.0076; 92.3±3.82 days vs 77.7±3.54 days in the HepG2-wt model, <italic>P = </italic>0.0122). (B) In the HCCLM3-wt model (left panel), tumor size was 1.70±0.12 cm<sup>3</sup> in the sorafenib group (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), 1.27±0.08 cm<sup>3</sup> in the group treated with both sorafenib and aspirin (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), and 3.68±0.18 cm<sup>3</sup> in the control group. In the HepG2-wt model (right panel), tumors were smaller in the sorafenib group (1.02±0.11 cm<sup>3</sup>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), and the group treated with combined sorafenib and aspirin (0.84±0.11 cm<sup>3</sup>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), compared with controls (2.90±0.29 cm<sup>3</sup>). (C) In the HCCLM3-wt model (left panel), the sorafenib group had more intrahepatic metastases (IHM), although tumor size was smaller, and the group treated with combined sorafenib and aspirin had significantly fewer IHM. The HepG2-wt model (right panel), was characterized by invasive growth, and sorafenib did not further increase its invasiveness and metastasis. However, tumor margins became clearer in the group treated with combined sorafenib and aspirin. (D) In the HCCLM3-wt model, there were obviously fewer lung metastases in the sorafenib group (9.67±1.71) compared to the control group (17.67±1.94, <italic>P = </italic>0.0129) The incidence of lung metastasis (6/6) was not decreased in the sorafenib group. However, the standardized number of lung metastases (SNLM) was greater in the sorafenib group (5.72±0.24) than in the control group (4.77±0.33, <italic>P = </italic>0.0457).

<title>2. Aspirin Up-regulated Tumor Suppressor Gene <italic>HTATIP2,</italic> which was Down-regulated by Sorafenib</title>
<p>We demonstrated in a previous study that sorafenib promotes the invasiveness and metastatic potential of HCC, which is associated with changes in the expression of a number of genes, as shown by a PCR array <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Zhang1">[12]</xref>. We therefore investigated which genes might be responsible for the effect of aspirin. A PCR array profiling the expression of 84 genes representative of the 6 biological pathways involved in transformation and tumorigenesis showed that, in the HCCLM3-wt xenograft model, mice treated with combined sorafenib and aspirin had significantly different expression of 5 genes compared with the sorafenib group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065023-g002">Figure 2</xref> A,B). <italic>HTATIP2</italic>, which was confirmed as the key gene down-regulated by sorafenib to promote the invasiveness and metastatic potential of HCC, was also identified as the key gene up-regulated by combined aspirin and sorafenib. Down-regulation of <italic>HTATIP2</italic> by sorafenib and up-regulation of <italic>HTATIP2</italic> by combination treatment were confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blotting in the HCCLM3-wt model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065023-g002">Figure 2</xref> C,D). Sorafenib did not down-regulate mRNA and protein expression of <italic>HTATIP2</italic> in HepG2-wt tumors compared with untreated tumors, probably because HepG2-wt has low expression of <italic>HTATIP2</italic>. However, combination treatment significantly up-regulated <italic>HTATIP2</italic> expression in the HepG2-wt xenograft model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065023-g002">Figure 2</xref> C,D).</p>

<p>A 48-hour proliferation assay showed that aspirin had little effect on tumor cells at a concentration of 0.1–1 mmol/L, but it significantly inhibited proliferation at a concentration of 10 mmol/L in HCCLM3-wt and at a concentration of 2–10 mmol/L in HepG2-wt (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0065023.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). Because the concentration of aspirin in human plasma was 0.15–0.3 mmol/L when it was taken at 100–300 mg/d for prevention of cerebro-cardiovascular diseases according to the drug instruction, we used 0.1 and 0.5 mmol/L in the following assays.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study demonstrated the synergistic effect of sorafenib and aspirin in prolonging median survival in 2 xenograft HCC models. Furthermore, aspirin suppressed the pro-invasion and pro-metastasis effects of sorafenib in HCC through up-regulation of <italic>HTATIP2</italic>, which was probably mediated by inhibition of COX2 expression.</p>
<p>An increasing number of preclinical studies have revealed that, in certain situations such as dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment, TKIs may promote invasiveness and metastatic potential of tumors despite inhibiting the growth of the tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Desar1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-deGroot1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Carter1">[28]</xref>. Potential mechanisms are intratumoral hypoxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-DeBock1">[29]</xref>, induction of other angiogenic cytokines when one is blocked <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Casanovas1">[30]</xref>, modulation of host environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Ebos1">[10]</xref>, selection of more invasive and metastatic tumors by blockade of vascular endothelial growth factor pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-PaezRibes1">[11]</xref>, and induction of metabolic changes in the tumor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Keunen1">[31]</xref>. In a previous study we found that low-dose sorafenib promoted invasiveness and metastatic potential of HCC with higher expression of <italic>HTATIP2</italic>, although it inhibited primary tumor growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Zhang1">[12]</xref>. Because sorafenib is currently the only drug approved for advanced HCC, there is an urgent need for a therapeutic approach that improves its efficacy by mitigating its pro-tumor effects.</p>
<p>Inflammation has decisive roles in tumor initiation, promotion, invasion, and metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Grivennikov1">[32]</xref>. Aspirin, an anti-inflammatory agent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Dinarello1">[33]</xref>, has shown usefulness in the prevention and treatment of cancers, especially those in the digestive tract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Rothwell1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Rothwell3">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Rothwell4">[18]</xref>. The anti-platelet effect of aspirin prevented HCC and improved survival in a mouse model of chronic hepatitis B by reducing the number of intrahepatic HBV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and HBV-nonspecific inflammatory cells and the severity of liver fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Sitia1">[34]</xref>. More recently, in a large randomized controlled study, aspirin decreased the incidence of HCC and death from chronic hepatic diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Sahasrabuddhe1">[35]</xref>, and another study showed that aspirin was associated with a reduced risk of hepatitis B virus–related HCC recurrence after liver resection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Wu1">[36]</xref>, which highlights the role of aspirin in HCC. Preclinical studies have also demonstrated the anti-tumor effect of aspirin in HCC. High concentrations (&gt;1 mM) of aspirin inhibited growth of cultured hepatoma cells as well as the synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Hial1">[37]</xref>. Intratumoral injection of 0.4 mL of 5% aspirin inhibited tumor growth in a rabbit VX2 tumor model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-SaadHossne1">[16]</xref>. Aspirin inhibited hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced invasiveness of HepG2 cells by inhibiting the kinase activity of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, resulting in the suppression of transcriptional activity of Elk-1 as well as nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and AP-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Abiru1">[17]</xref>. In chemically induced HCC, aspirin suppressed lung metastasis by down-regulating intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) or by inhibiting NF-κB signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Futakuchi1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Futakuchi2">[39]</xref>. The present study demonstrated that low-dosage aspirin (0.1–0.5 mM) did not inhibit the proliferation of HCC cells; however, it did inhibit the invasiveness of HCC cells with lower expression of <italic>HTATIP2</italic>, which is a known tumor suppressor gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Zhao1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Zhao2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Zhao3">[40]</xref>. In the xenograft HepG2-wt model, tumor margins became clearer in the aspirin group than in the control group, but tumor volume did not change in the aspirin-treated HCCLM3-wt and HepG2-wt models. This indicates that aspirin alone may not be effective in inhibiting primary tumor growth in HCC, even in a HepG2-wt model with low expression of <italic>HTATIP2</italic>. This is also supported by the results of the in vitro study, which showed that aspirin did not inhibit proliferation but did inhibit invasiveness in HCC cells with lower expression of <italic>HTATIP2</italic>. The present findings suggest that a combination of sorafenib and aspirin will achieve a better result than either alone, similar to the result of another study wherein aspirin enhanced doxorubicin-induced apoptosis and reduced tumor growth in HCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Hossain1">[41]</xref>. The combination of sorafenib and aspirin should be given to patients regardless of <italic>HTATIP2</italic> expression status.</p>
<p>A recent study of ours revealed that sorafenib may down-regulate <italic>HTATIP2</italic> through the JAK/STAT pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Zhang1">[12]</xref>. The present study showed <italic>HTATIP2</italic> can be up-regulated by aspirin, probably through inhibition of COX2 expression, but not pSTAT3, β-catenin, NF-κB, or COX1, although all these factors have been demonstrated as target molecules of aspirin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Langley1">[25]</xref>. Other mechanisms that may contribute to the anti-invasion effect of aspirin were not investigated in the present study, eg, inhibition of HGF-induced invasion of HepG2 through ERK1/2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Abiru1">[17]</xref>; initiation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis mediated by increased metabolic and oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Raza1">[42]</xref>; and inhibition or delay of immune-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Sitia1">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>The main side effect of aspirin in clinical application was gastrointestinal hemorrhage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Baigent1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Morgan1">[44]</xref>. Patients with cirrhosis often have coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia, and approximately 80% of patients with HCC have cirrhosis. Therefore, caution is warranted when using aspirin for HCC patients. The risk of gastrointestinal bleeding was significantly reduced when the dosage of aspirin was decreased <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Huang1">[45]</xref>. Pharmacokinetic data showed that the concentration of aspirin in human plasma is 0.15–0.3 mmol/L when patients take a lower dosage (100–300 mg daily) according to the drug instruction. At 0.1 and 0.5 mmol/L, the working concentrations in the in vitro assays were considered low dosages. A dosage of 15 mg/kg aspirin in animals was equivalent to 75–100 mg daily dosage in human beings, when it was converted based on drug mass per body surface area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-ReaganShaw1">[46]</xref>. In addition, aspirin in combination with a histamine-receptor inhibitor or proton-pump inhibitor reduced the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Chan1">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065023-Yusuf1">[50]</xref>. In a large-sample study, aspirin use was associated with reduced risk of death due to chronic liver disease, and regular aspirin use was shown to be safe for patients with chronic liver disease. Therefore, a low dosage of aspirin should be safe for well-selected HCC patients, even those with liver cirrhosis. Furthermore, the present study also suggests that a combination of sorafenib and a COX2 inhibitor should achieve a similar synergistic effect without increasing the risk of bleeding.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we found that aspirin reduced the invasiveness and metastasis of HCC through up-regulation of <italic>HTATIP2</italic> expression, which is mediated by inhibition of COX2 expression. Sorafenib may down-regulate <italic>HTATIP2</italic> expression, resulting in greater invasiveness and metastasis. Therefore, aspirin could be used to improve the efficacy of sorafenib, regardless of <italic>HTATIP2</italic> expression in HCC tumor cells.</p>
