Larvae of many solitary bees feed almost exclusively on pollen and thus could be highly exposed to transgene products expressed in the pollen. The potential effects of pollen from oilseed rape expressing the cysteine protease inhibitor oryzacystatin-1 (OC-1) were investigated on larvae of the solitary bee <italic>Osmia bicornis</italic> ( = <italic>O. rufa</italic>). Furthermore, recombinant OC-1 (rOC-1), the Bt toxin Cry1Ab and the snowdrop lectin <italic>Galanthus nivalis</italic> agglutinin (GNA) were evaluated for effects on the life history parameters of this important pollinator. Pollen provisions from transgenic OC-1 oilseed rape did not affect overall development. Similarly, high doses of rOC-1 and Cry1Ab as well as a low dose of GNA failed to cause any significant effects. However, a high dose of GNA (0.1%) in the larval diet resulted in significantly increased development time and reduced efficiency in conversion of pollen food into larval body weight. Our results suggest that OC-1 and Cry1Ab expressing transgenic crops would pose a negligible risk for <italic>O. bicornis</italic> larvae, whereas GNA expressing plants could cause detrimental effects, but only if bees were exposed to high levels of the protein. The described bioassay with bee brood is not only suitable for early tier non-target tests of transgenic plants, but also has broader applicability to other crop protection products.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was financially supported by the Swiss Office for the Environment (FOEN).

However, various strategies based on the use of plant or animal derived genes are actively being pursued <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Christou1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Ferry1">[3]</xref>. A major concern raised in connection with the cultivation of transgenic plants is their potential to harm beneficial insects such as bees. By pollinating wild and cultivated plants, bees make a significant contribution to the functioning of natural ecosystems and to the human food supply <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Klein1">[4]</xref>. Honey bees (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic> L.) are regarded as the most economically important pollinators of agricultural crops worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-McGregor1">[5]</xref>. However, solitary bees (both wild and managed) also provide an important pollination service and their value for agriculture is increasingly being recognized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-OToole1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Winfree1">[8]</xref>. This is particularly true for areas and crops where honey bees are absent or are inefficient pollinators, and under these conditions non-<italic>Apis</italic> bees can substantially enhance production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Corbet1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Westerkamp1">[10]</xref>. In the late 1950s, the use of non-<italic>Apis</italic> bees (i.e. the two solitary bees <italic>Nomia melanderi</italic> Cockerell and <italic>Megachile rotundata</italic> Fabricius) started to become important in commercial pollination. Since then, several solitary bee species (mainly members of the genus <italic>Osmia</italic>) have been developed into manageable crop pollinators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Free1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Bosch1">[12]</xref> and have often been found to contribute to higher crop yields than honey bees (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Bosch2">[13]</xref>).</p><p>Direct effects of transgene products on bees will depend upon both exposure to the protein and its toxicity. When foraging on an insect-resistant GM crop, bees are potentially exposed to the insecticidal protein by consuming pollen and nectar. Nectar is known to contain mainly sugars <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Roshchina1">[14]</xref>, whereas pollen is known to contain up to 61% protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Roulston1">[15]</xref>. For instance, relatively high levels of the Bt toxin Cry1Ab were found in the pollen of the first generation transgenic maize Event176 (4–7 µg g−1 dry weight, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Fearing1">[16]</xref>). Although all bee pollinators consume pollen to some degree, their susceptibility to a transgene product expressed in pollen may vary among taxa due to relevant differences in physiology, behavior and ecology. Besides differences in the susceptibility to insecticidal protein, bee taxa vary also in the amount of foreign protein the larvae are exposed to. Whereas young honey bee larvae are mainly fed with glandular secretions from adult bees and ingest only very small amounts of pollen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Malone1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Babendreier1">[18]</xref>, larvae of solitary bees feed on provisions mainly consisting of pollen throughout their entire feeding period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Wcislo1">[19]</xref>. Thus, if the transgene is expressed in the pollen, the solitary bee larvae will be directly exposed.</p><p>Larvae are often regarded as the most vulnerable stage in an insect's life cycle. However, there are relatively few studies investigating potential effects of insect-resistant transgenic plants, or their purified transgene products, on honey bee larvae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Malone2">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Lehrman1">[23]</xref> and no such studies have been carried out to date for larvae of solitary bees. Toxicity to solitary bee larvae has been measured for pesticides, although mainly under field conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Tasei1">[24]</xref>. When pollen provisions manually ‘spiked’ with test substances where used, the relative test concentrations were not standardized due to the addition of a defined absolute amount of test compounds to bee-collected pollen provisions of probably variable size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Tasei2">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Tesoriero1">[27]</xref>.</p><p>Due to the increasing importance of Bt-expressing crops globally, Cry proteins isolated from the bacterium <italic>B. thuringiensis</italic> have been extensively studied in terms of their impact on beneficial insects. Various studies have assessed Bt-plants both in laboratory and field trials and revealed no adverse effects on honey bees or bumble bees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Malone2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Rose1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Duan1">[29]</xref>. The use of genes encoding lectins or protease inhibitors (PIs) represents two further strategies for the production of GM crops with enhanced levels of resistance to insect pests. Both groups of proteins have a relatively broad activity range. The snowdrop lectin (<italic>Galanthus nivalis</italic> agglutinin, GNA) has been shown to be effective against insect pests from several different orders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Hilder1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Hogervorst1">[31]</xref>. With respect to hymenopteran species, a GNA concentration of 0.1% has been found to cause direct toxic effects on bumble bees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Babendreier2">[32]</xref> and four different parasitic wasps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Romeis1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Hogervorst2">[35]</xref>.

The aims of this study were therefore to: (i) develop suitable experimental methods for laboratory-based non-target testing of transgenic plants or purified transgene products and solitary bee larvae and (ii) investigate potential direct toxic effects of an insect-resistant transgenic crop or purified insecticidal proteins on life cycle parameters of a solitary bee species. The model system consisted of the red mason bee <italic>Osmia bicornis</italic> L. ( = <italic>O. rufa</italic>) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) and a transgenic oilseed rape (<italic>Brassica napus</italic> L.) expressing the cysteine protease inhibitor oryzacystatin-1 (OC-1) originating from rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.). The insecticidal proteins (i) OC-1, (ii) GNA, and (iii) the Bt toxin Cry1Ab were tested in purified form by adding them to the pollen of control oilseed rape plants. Oilseed rape is not only a relevant forage plant for wild and managed bees because of its ample pollen and nectar, it is also a very important field crop in Europe and many other parts of the world <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Westcott1">[38]</xref>. <italic>Osmia bicornis</italic> is a univoltine, polylectic solitary bee prevalent in Europe and northern Africa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Westrich1">[39]</xref>.

Two cages (3.0×2.0×2.5 m) were installed in glasshouse units (25±5°C, L16∶D8) containing 30–70 flowering oilseed rape plants either of the transgenic OC-1 line or the non-transgenic isoline. Throughout the course of the experiment, withering plants were replaced by fresh ones. Each cage contained artificial nesting units (metal cans filled with paper tubes of 8 mm diameter) and the raw material for building nest cell partitions (approximately 1 kg of field-collected soil, kept moist). To ensure that nectar availability was not a limiting factor for cell provisioning and food supply was sufficient at all times, sugar solution (50% w∶v) was offered in bird feeders. Newly emerged bees of both sexes were released into the cages with a constant population of approximately 60 bees per cage (2∶1 F∶M sex ratio). After mating, the females started building linear series of up to four nest cells separated by mud partitions in the provided paper tubes. Each cell contained a loaf of pollen mixed with nectar, on top of which an egg was laid. Nesting units were checked daily for paper tubes with a freshly sealed entrance (indicating completed nesting activity) and these tubes were removed.</p></sec><sec id="s2d2"><title>Treatments</title><p>Sealed paper tubes were carefully opened and the contents of the brood cells were extracted with forceps. Pollen masses originating from the transgenic plants were used to test for effects on larvae consuming transgenic OC-1 pollen. Masses consisting of pollen collected from non-transformed control plants were randomly assigned to either a treatment with purified insecticidal protein or to the control without protein additive. The insecticidal proteins tested were: rOC-1 (final concentration 0.1% of fresh pollen provision w∶w), GNA (0.01% and 0.1%), and Cry1Ab (0.01%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002664-t001">Table 1</xref>).

Furthermore, neither the transgenic OC-1 expressing pollen nor any of the other treatments with insecticidal protein (rOC-1 0.1%, Cry1Ab 0.01%, GNA 0.01%) had a negative impact on bee performance during larval development or subsequent pupation and wintering. Thus the impact of GNA on <italic>O. bicornis</italic> larvae appears to be dose dependent, in agreement with the results obtained by Babendreier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Babendreier2">[32]</xref> in the only other published study that tested effects of GNA on bees. In that study, when bumble bee micro-colonies received GNA dissolved in sucrose solution, adult workers and males suffered from sharply increased mortality at 0.1% GNA, whereas less severe sub-lethal effects were found at 0.01%. With respect to the more pronounced effects observed by Babendreier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Babendreier2">[32]</xref> compared to the present study, it should be noted that adult bumble bees and solitary bees consume much larger quantities of nectar (or sucrose solution) than pollen, although quantitative data for this are missing. This means that for a given test concentration, the absolute amount of toxin ingested by adult bumble bees in the study of Babendreier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Babendreier2">[32]</xref> was approximately five to ten times greater than the amount ingested by <italic>O. bicornis</italic> larvae in the present study. Thus a greater impact on bee performance would have been anticipated in the study on bumble bees. Interestingly, in a different study where GNA was provided via pollen to bumble bee micro-colonies, neither adult nor larval mortality was affected in the 0.1% GNA treatment (Babendreier and Konrad, unpublished), an observation in agreement with the present study and more ecologically relevant as nectar generally does not contain proteins.</p><p>While no acute toxicity was observed in the present study, the sub-lethal effects on larval development observed at 0.1% GNA could negatively affect bee survival or fitness under field conditions.

In the present study, foraging bees were confined to oilseed rape for the provisioning of their nest cells. In the case of field-grown transgenic oilseed rape, such severely restricted foraging would represent a worst-case scenario delivering the highest possible exposure to the transgene product. However, when other pollen sources are scarce in an area, native bees can rely almost exclusively on the abundant forage provided by flowering oilseed rape fields. <italic>Osmia bicornis</italic> females can restrict their visits to the same major pollen source (<italic>Ranunculus</italic> or <italic>Quercus</italic>) during their entire nesting period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Raw1">[63]</xref> and up to 40% of <italic>O. bicornis</italic> provision masses were found to consist exclusively of oilseed rape pollen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Sick1">[64]</xref>.

Thus, if an insect-resistant transgenic oilseed rape expressing the resistance trait in the pollen is grown in the field, larval provisions in nearby <italic>O. bicornis</italic> nests may contain relatively large proportions of the transgene product.</p><p>Since larvae of solitary bees feed almost exclusively on pollen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Wcislo1">[19]</xref>, whereas young honey bee larvae receive mainly glandular secretions but only very small amounts of pollen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Malone1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Babendreier1">[18]</xref>, solitary bee larvae are more likely to be exposed to potentially insecticidal proteins expressed in pollen. Furthermore, the impact of hazardous larval food on solitary bee populations could be severe, since many solitary bees have a relatively short reproductive season and only one offspring generation per year. With respect to the fact that biosafety studies have predominantly focused on the honey bee as a non-target insect pollinator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Malone2">[20]</xref>, it is important to be cautious when extrapolating results with honey bees to solitary bees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Thompson1">[67]</xref>. The significantly higher exposure of solitary bee larvae to transgene products expressed in pollen should be considered when defining the test concentrations for early tier experiments in an environmental risk assessment of transgenic plants and bees.</p><p>The experimental methods described here are not only suitable for early tier testing in non-target risk assessments of transgenic plants, but could also be adopted for pre-release laboratory testing of agrochemicals, including systemic pesticides which may be found in the pollen. In <italic>in vitro</italic> toxicity tests with honey bee larvae, high levels of control mortality, probably due to grafting, can be a problem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Brdsgaard1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Lehrman1">[23]</xref>. In the present study, however, low control mortality was observed which is likely to be due to the minimal handling of eggs and larvae required when rearing solitary bees on their provisions. As a further merit of the experimental design developed in this study, not only the larval rearing but also the pollen collection and preparation were conducted under standardized conditions which is an improvement compared to earlier studies investigating potential effects of pesticides on larvae of solitary bees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Tasei2">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002664-Peach1">[26]</xref>.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of the present study indicate that it is very unlikely that either OC-1 or Cry1Ab would pose a risk to larvae of <italic>O. bicornis</italic>.
