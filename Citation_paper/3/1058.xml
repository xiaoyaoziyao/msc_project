<abstract>
<p>BRD4 is a transcriptional co-activator functioning to recruit regulatory complexes to acetylated chromatin. A subset of High-grade Serous Ovarian Cancer (HGSOC) patients are typified by focal, recurrent BRD4 gene amplifications. Despite previously described cancer dependencies, it is unclear whether BRD4 amplification events are oncogenic in HGSOC. We find that physiologically relevant levels of expression of BRD4 isoforms in non-transformed ovarian cells result in cellular transformation. Transcriptional profiling of BRD4-transformed ovarian cells, and BRD4-amplified HGSOC patient samples revealed shared expression patterns, including enriched MYC, and E2F1 gene signatures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a novel BET inhibitor, AZD5153, is highly active in BRD4-amplified patient derived xenografts and uncover Neuregulin-1 as a novel BRD4 effector. Experiments involving Neuregulin-1 inhibition and exogenous addition, demonstrate Neuregulin-1 as necessary and sufficient for BRD4-mediated transformation. This study demonstrates the oncogenic potential of BRD4 amplification in cancer and establishes BRD4-amplified HGSOC as a potential patient population that could benefit from BET inhibitors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) is a member of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family of chromatin reader proteins, which also includes BRD2, BRD3, and BRDT. BET proteins feature two conserved N-terminal bromodomains that serve to interact with N-acetyl lysine residues on histones and nuclear proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref004">4</xref>]. BRD4 localizes to discrete genomic regions via interactions with acetylated chromatin, and BRD4 functions to regulate RNA-pol II-mediated elongation and transcription through direct interaction with the Mediator complex and pTEFb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref006">6</xref>]. By interacting directly with acetylated transcription factors, including RelA, ERα, p53, and TWIST, BRD4 can function to maintain oncogenic gene expression in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref009">9</xref>]. At enhancer and promoter regions, BRD4 facilitates the combinatorial interactions among acetylated histones, transcription factors, and nuclear proteins to promote cell-type specific transcription. Although BRD4 lacks catalytic activity, BET bromodomains are amenable to drug targeting by selective acetyl-lysine mimetic small-molecules. The first characterized BET bromodomain chemical probes, JQ1 and I-BET have demonstrated pre-clinical activity primarily in hematologic cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref012">12</xref>]. Building on compelling preclinical efficacy, efforts in translating BRD4 probe compounds into clinical drug candidates have resulted in a number of ongoing clinical programs, testing BRD4 inhibition in a wide range of solid and hematologic malignancies including Nut Midline Carcinoma, Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Myelodysplastic Syndromes, Multiple Myeloma, Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma, and Glioblastoma Multiforme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Epithelial ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer-related mortality in women and the most lethal gynecologic malignancy in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref022">22</xref>]. Advances in chemotherapeutic and surgical strategies, improved understanding of natural history, and the elucidation of genetic determinants of disease have resulted in meaningful improvements in patient survival without substantially improving cure rates. Of the five epithelial histological subtypes, high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is the most malignant form of epithelial ovarian cancer and accounts for approximately 70% of all ovarian cancer cases and deaths. Despite recent advances, approximately 25% of HGSOC patients relapse within 6 months of completing platinum-taxane chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref023">23</xref>]. Genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have revealed nearly ubiquitous TP53 mutations in HGSOC. In addition, somatic and/or germline BRCA1/2 mutations occur in approximately 22% of tumors and play a critical role in disease progression and therapeutic response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref024">24</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref025">25</xref>]. Although other recurrent oncogenic mutations in this tumor type are extremely rare, somatic copy-number alterations and whole genome duplications occur frequently in HGSOC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref026">26</xref>]. For example, frequent, recurrent, focal gene amplification has been reported in well-characterized oncogenes, such as PIK3CA, MYC, and CCNE1; however, the majority of genes within focal amplification events remain uncharacterized for their oncogenic activity, and thus potential for therapeutic intervention. For instance, a distinct ovarian cancer molecular subtype with poor prognosis has been characterized by somatic, focal copy-number amplifications on chromosome 19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref027">27</xref>]. Interestingly, BRD4 resides on chromosome 19p and its focal amplification has been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref029">29</xref>]. Additionally, in treatment naïve HGSOC, BRD4 amplification correlates with poor clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref030">30</xref>]. However, prior to this study, the oncogenic activity imparted through BRD4 amplification in HGSOC remained uncharacterized.</p>
<p>Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) is a glycoprotein and tropic factor containing an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain that signals by stimulating ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases. The NRG1 gene contains distinct 5’ flanking regulatory elements, which allows for six distinct proteins with at least 31 known isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref031">31</xref>]. The EGF-like domain is located on the extracellular domain and is necessary and sufficient for activation of ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases. As it relates to HGSOC patients, NRG1 has been shown to drive proliferation of ovarian cancer cells in the context of activated ErbB3/NRG1 autocrine signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref032">32</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we hypothesized that focal BRD4 amplification is oncogenic, and therapeutically actionable in HGSOC patients. We sought to interrogate the functional activity of BRD4 amplification by assessing BRD4-mediated oncogenic potential in non-transformed, immortalized ovarian epithelial cells. We demonstrate the potent transforming activity of BRD4 in this setting, and show that NRG1 functions as a critical effector in BRD4-mediated cellular transformation. Our BRD4 transformation model revealed that NRG1 expression is regulated by BRD4 activity that is mediated by the SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling complex. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of targeting BRD4 in BRD4-amplified HGSOC patient-derived xenografts and the impact on NRG1 expression using AZD5153, a bivalent BET bromodomain inhibitor that has recently entered clinical testing (NCT03205176). Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of co-targeting of BRD4 and NRG1 signaling in the context of BRD4-amplified patient-derived tumor models.</p>

<p>Cells (5×10<sup>7</sup>) were treated with 200 nM AZD5153 for 4 hours and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, #F8775) for 15 min at room temperature followed by 5 min treatment with 0.125 M Glycine. The cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and cell pellet was collected. The nuclear fraction was extracted by first resuspending the pellet in 10 mL of LB1 buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, and 0.25% Triton X-100) for 10 min at 4°C. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in 10 mL of LB2 buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.5 mM EGTA), and mixed at 4°C for 10 min. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1.5 mL of sonication buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1% Na-deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS) and sonicated in a waterbath sonicator (Diagenode Bioruptor) (50x30s pulse, medium power). The chromatin was precipitated with 80 μL of anti-FLAG M2 Magnetic Beads (Sigma-Aldrich #M8823) or 8 μg of pre-conjugated anti-IgG/Protein A Dynabeads (Invitrogen #10002D) per 100 μg of chromatin in a volume of 600 μL of sonication buffer for 4 hr at 4°C. The precipitates were washed three times with sonication buffer, once with sonication buffer containing 500 mM NaCl, once with LiCl buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 250 mM LiCl, 0.5% Na-Deoxycholate and 0.5% NP-40) and once with TBS (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). Precipitates were eluted in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1% SDS and 1 mM EDTA, decrosslinked, RNaseA and Proteinase K digested and purified using Qiagen PCR purification kits.

<title>BRD4 mRNA and protein expression is correlated with BRD4 copy-number in high-grade serous ovarian cancer</title>
<p>We utilized The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data to interrogate BRD4 amplification across all represented cancer subtypes. BRD4 amplification occurs most frequently (~18%) in high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). These patients exhibit focal BRD4 gain on chromosome 19p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). GISTIC analysis confirmed that BRD4 is the 4<sup>th</sup> most frequently amplified peak in HGSOC (Data not shown). Furthermore, there was a strong correlation (R = 0.83) between DNA copy-number and BRD4 mRNA expression, suggesting selective evolutionary pressure for BRD4 gain in cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Additionally, BRD4 copy-number correlates with BRD4 protein expression levels as measured by reverse phase protein array (RPPA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Further, of all cancer types tested for BRD4 protein expression by RPPA in cBioPortal, ovarian cancer exhibits the highest level of BRD4 protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g001">Fig 1E</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref035">35</xref>]. To assess the functional importance of both long and short BRD4 spliced isoforms, we examined mRNA expression across HGSOC TCGA patient data. The expression level of both long and short BRD4 isoforms is significantly upregulated in a concordant fashion in BRD4-amplified HGSOC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). Both BRD4 isoforms share identical N-terminal protein domain architecture, where the tandem bromodomains are located, while the long isoform possesses a unique C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g001">Fig 1G</xref>).</p>

<title>BRD4 over-expression is sufficient to transform immortalized ovarian cells</title>
<p>To study the functional consequences of BRD4 amplification in ovarian cancer, we surveyed BRD4 copy-number across the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). Out of 1042 cell lines examined only four exhibited BRD4 amplification, as defined by GISTIC2.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). None of the four lines with amplified BRD4 were derived from ovarian cancer patients. To circumvent this challenge, we engineered a BRD4 amplified model through enforced expression of BRD4 in a non-transformed, immortalized ovarian surface epithelial cell (IOSE) background. The BRD4 expression level achieved in IOSE was similar to levels found in BRD4-amplifed HGSOC patient derived xenografts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>In order to assess the oncogenic potential of BRD4 in ovarian cancer, we examined the anchorage-independent growth potential of BRD4 long and short-isoform expressing IOSE cells. Compared to empty vector transduced cells, both BRD4 long and short-isoform expressing IOSE gained robust colony formation potential, a cellular phenotype associated with oncogenic transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). The colony formation potential of short-isoform expressing IOSE was greater than long-isoform expressing counterparts, which could potentially result from more efficient ectopic protein expression of the short-form. Plating BRD4 expressing IOSE in the presence of 500 nM JQ1, a BET-bromodomain selective tool small-molecule inhibitor, abrogated colony formation potential, confirming the dependence of colony formation on BRD4 bromodomain function. Conversely, enforced expression of BRD4 was unable to confer IL3 growth independence in BaF3 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0200826.s001">S1A–S1D Fig</xref>), thus demonstrating that the transforming activity of BRD4 may be cell-type specific. In order to assess the growth kinetics of BRD4 expressing IOSE cells, we assayed cell proliferation via phase-contrast live cell imaging. Short-isoform expressing IOSE achieved maximum confluence approximately 1.5–2 times faster than empty vector IOSE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). The increased proliferative capacity of short-isoform expressing IOSE coincided with a significant steady-state increase in S-Phase, and G2/M populations as assessed by combined BrdU and 7AAD staining by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). However, the differential between long-isoform expressing and the empty vector is not significant under these experimental conditions.</p>

<title>BRD4 expressing IOSE and BRD4 amplified high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma patients have common cancer-related transcriptional features</title>

The differential expression, expressed as signal-to-noise, between BRD4-amplified tumors (GISTIC ≥ 2) and non-amplified tumors (GISTIC &lt; 2) was used to generate gene lists and perform GSEA. We similarly performed GSEA on BRD4 long and short-isoform expressing IOSE cells. From the three GSEA lists generated, we examined shared oncogenic gene sets using a cutoff of p &lt; 0.05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g003">Fig 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0200826.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).

<title>NRG1 is a BRD4 transcriptional effector and is necessary and sufficient for IOSE transformation</title>
<p>In order to define critical effectors in BRD4-amplified ovarian cancer, we deployed RNA-sequencing to identify genes upregulated in BRD4 long and short-isoform expressing IOSE. Similarly, we identified genes downregulated by AZD5153, a previously described potent and selective bivalent BRD4/BET inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref036">36</xref>] in OV0857F, a BRD4-amplified PDX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). We examined the intersection of these three transcriptional data sets and found 6 putative BRD4 transcriptional effectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref037">37</xref>](<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). From the six putative effectors, NRG1 was chosen for further study because of previously described roles in supporting the in vivo proliferation and metastasis of ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref038">38</xref>].

<p>We hypothesized that increased levels of NRG1 in BRD4-expressing IOSE would lead to activation of relevant downstream signaling pathways including HER2/3, Ras, PI3K and STAT3. To test this hypothesis, we deployed a phospho-RTK protein array to examine phosphorylation signaling events following induction of BRD4 expression. Consistent with the known signaling mechanism of NRG1, we observed increased pAKT (S473), pErbB2 (pan-Y), pErbB3 (pan-Y), pERK1/2 (T202/Y204), and pSTAT3 (Y705) in BRD4 expressing IOSE as compared to empty vector IOSE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0200826.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). We performed immunoblots to confirm activation of ErbB signaling and observed increases in levels of pErbB2, pAKT, and pERK1/2 in IOSE cells expressing BRD4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g004">Fig 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on signaling data from our BRD4 engineered system, we hypothesized that BRD4-amplified HGSOC patients would exhibit similar dysregulated signaling patterns. In support of this hypothesis, GSEA performed on HGSOC TCGA RNA-sequencing data revealed an enriched (FDR = 0.017, p = 0.000) ERBB2 gene signature associated with BRD4-amplified HGSOC patient tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g004">Fig 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to examine whether BRD4 could mediate NRG1 transcription through direct promoter and enhancer loading we performed ChIP experiments. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g004">Fig 4F and 4G</xref>, BRD4 is enriched at MYC transcription start site (TSS) and enhancer regions. BRD4 is displaced from MYC TSS and enhancer regions through BET inhibition via AZD5153, consistent with the previously reported relationship between BRD4 and MYC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref037">37</xref>]. Similar to the MYC loci, BRD4 binding was detected at two independent NRG1 promoter and enhancer sites; the addition of AZD5153 to these cells prevented BRD4 loading to NRG1 promoter and enhancer regions. However, BRD4 binding to both MYC and NRG1 promoter and enhancer regions was more sensitive to BET inhibition via AZD5153 in the long-isoform expressing cells.</p>
<p>To test the kinetics of BET inhibitor-mediated NRG1 mRNA inhibition, we performed time course experiments in IOSE cells with AZD5153. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g004">Fig 4H and 4I</xref>, NRG1 mRNA levels are rapidly reduced following addition of 200 nM AZD5153. Although AZD5153-induced MYC mRNA modulation occurs with faster kinetics, NRG1 mRNA level was similarly depleted by 50% within 4hr; consistent with a BRD4-mediated transcriptional mechanism.</p>
<p>To assess whether NRG1 expression is required for BRD4-mediated IOSE transformation, we stably knocked down NRG1 using RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g004">Fig 4J</xref>). Soft agar colony formation potential of both BRD4 long and short-isoform expressing IOSE was markedly decreased via NRG1 knockdown with two independent NRG1-targeted shRNA hairpins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g004">Fig 4K and 4L</xref>), confirming a requirement for NRG1 expression in BRD4-mediated IOSE cell transformation.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that the signal provided by NRG1 would be sufficient to transform IOSE in the absence of BRD4. To test this hypothesis, we performed soft-agar assays in the presence of 10 ng/mL recombinant NRG1. In empty-vector transduced IOSE, the presence of 10 ng/mL NRG1 was sufficient to induce colony formation, yielding a level similar to that of BRD4-expressing IOSE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g004">Fig 4K and 4L</xref>).</p>

<title>NRG1 suppression is a pharmacodynamic marker in BRD4-amplified ovarian cancer patient derived xenografts</title>
<p>We hypothesized that NRG1 may be a BRD4-amplification effector, and that the suppression of NRG1 expression by AZD5153 in HGSOC patient-derived xenografts might be restricted to BRD4-amplified PDX. To test this hypothesis, we screened a repository of ovarian cancer patient-derived xenografts for BRD4 copy-number (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0200826.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). We selected three patient derived xenografts for further study: OV0857F (BRD4 CN = 6), HOXF062 (BRD4 CN = 5) and OV2022F (BRD4 CN = 2). In the two BRD4-amplified PDX, OV0857F and HOXF062, a single dose of AZD5153 was sufficient to suppress NRG1 expression at the mRNA and protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g005">Fig 5A–5D</xref>). In addition, we observed increased protein levels of BRD4 in response to AZD5153 in BRD4-amplified PDX models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g005">Fig 5B and 5D</xref>). We suspect this phenomenon is due to increased BRD4 protein stabilization, as we have observed it in other cell lines and xenograft model systems (data not shown). Enhanced downregulation of NRG1, or more significant BRD4 stabilization, was observed with 4-day repeat dosing (QDx4) in OV0857F tumors. Conversely, in OV2022F lacking BRD4 gene amplification, NRG1 mRNA and protein were not significantly modulated by AZD5153, even under the more stringent BRD4 inhibition conditions of twice daily dosing for 3 days (BIDx3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g005">Fig 5E and 5F</xref>). Interestingly, we did not observe BRD4 protein stabilization under all treatment conditions in OV2022F model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g005">Fig 5F</xref>).</p>

<title>BRD4 amplification confers sensitivity to BET bromodomain inhibitors in HGSOC</title>
<p>In order to assess the relationship between BRD4 amplification or expression level and sensitivity towards BRD4 inhibition, we utilized Sanger cell line screening data, which provided a 3-day JQ1 IC50 on 12 ovarian cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref039">39</xref>].

<p>We tested the in vivo anti-tumor activity of AZD5153 on two BRD4-amplified patient-derived xenografts, OV0857F and HOXF062, as well as one non-amplified PDX OV2022F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g006">Fig 6C–6E</xref>). In both BRD4 amplified models, over the 25-day course of drug administration, at 5 and 10 mg/kg QD, AZD5153 led to tumor stasis, with 100% tumor growth inhibition (TGI) in OV0857F and 98% TGI in HOXF062 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>). Conversely, the non-BRD4-amplified model, OV2022F, was largely refractory to AZD5153 at 10 mg/kg QD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). In all patient derived models with BRD4 amplification tested with AZD5153, we observed NRG1 downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g005">Fig 5A–5D</xref>). Additionally, considering BRD4 linkage to MYC has been demonstrated in multiple disease settings, we examined the anti-tumor activity of AZD5153 in a MYC amplified (but also with BRD4 copy-number gain of 3) ovarian patient-derived xenograft, OV0452F. At 5 mg/kg, AZD5153 induced a mean tumor regression of 39% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0200826.s005">S5C Fig</xref>). Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis revealed robust MYC repression at 2, 4 and 8 hr following acute AZD5153 administration, supporting MYC modulation as an on-target anti-tumor mechanism in this model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0200826.s005">S5D Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To test whether inhibition of NRG1 signaling could result in anti-tumor activity in BRD4-amplified HGSOC tumors, we employed lapatinib, an orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against the HER pathway. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g006">Fig 6F</xref>, lapatinib is active in OV0857F tumors, and the combination of lapatinib and AZD5153 yielded synergistic anti-tumor activity, resulting in tumor regression. However, the combination regimen used requires further optimization, as animal bodyweight loss in the combination group resulted in early study termination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0200826.s005">S5E Fig</xref>). Furthermore, AZD5153 monotherapy was well tolerated at 10 mg/kg QD when administered as monotherapy in BRD4-amplified PDX models, with animals losing less than 10% body weight by day 30 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0200826.s005">S5F Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>A BRD4-SWI/SNF interaction maintains NRG1 expression and is necessary for BRD4-mediated transformation</title>
<p>We used proteomics as an unbiased approach to identify BRD4 protein binding partners. We included 1 μM JQ1 to assess bromodomain-specific interacting proteins. Our proteomics data revealed BRD4 interactions among 12/25 of the SWI/SNF complex members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Network analysis performed by ToppGene Suite identified Biological process and Cellular Component Gene Ontology terms related to SWI/SNF function and localization significantly enriched in short-isoform proteomics hits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Interestingly, SWI/SNF proteins were not detected by the mass spectrometry analysis of the pulldown of BRD4 long-form. We suspect that the lack of detection may be due to the relative low abundance of SWI/SNF proteins compared to other BRD4 long-form interacting partners and the threshold of detection sensitivity of discovery-mode proteomics. In order to validate our mass spectrometry findings, we performed immunoprecipitations, using FLAG antibody to specifically pull down either long or short isoform of BRD4. We performed immunoblots to examine association of each isoform with select SWI/SNF complex members, using CDK9 as a positive control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref040">40</xref>]; immunoprecipitations were also carried out using a BRD4 antibody that recognizes both isoforms of BRD4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). Consistent with our proteomic data, we demonstrate an interaction between short-isoform of BRD4 and SWI/SNF complex members, including SMARCA4, SMARCA2, SMARCC1, and SMARCC2. Interestingly, similar interactions were observed with BRD4 long-isoform. Thus, the lack of long-form-SWI/SNF interactions in our IP-MS dataset is likely due to technical limitations. Additionally, weaker bands were observed with empty vector (EV) control under the conditions of BRD4 IP with BRD4 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200826.g007">Fig 7C</xref>, right panel), due to the presence of endogenously-expressed BRD4.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In these studies we assessed the potential oncogenic activity of recurrent, focal BRD4 amplification in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). We deployed IOSE as a model system to test the phenotypic consequences of enforced BRD4 isoform expression. Although previous reports had identified focal BRD4 amplification in HGSOC, our study is the first to demonstrate the transforming activity of both short and long isoforms of BRD4 in an ovarian cell background. We show that both long and short isoforms of BRD4 are coordinately expressed in BRD4-amplified HGSOC tumors, and BRD4 copy-number is correlated with protein expression. Similar to a previous study in breast cancer, the short isoform of BRD4 appeared to have more potent transforming activity than the long isoform of BRD4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref041">41</xref>]. The difference in transformation potential between BRD4 isoforms could potentially be explained by the presence and function of a C-terminal domain in the long isoform of BRD4, which mediates interaction between BRD4 and pTEFb. This phenomenon could also be explained by increased ectopic protein expression efficiency exhibited with the short isoform. We hypothesize that the presence of both BRD4 isoforms may be required for cooperative oncogenic activity in the context of high-grade serous ovarian cancer. However, further studies will be required to fully characterize the independent activity of each BRD4 isoform in this context. Given the absence of BRD4-amplified ovarian cancer cell lines, we used IOSE cells stably expressing the different BRD4 isoforms at levels similar to those in patients with amplified BRD4. Therefore, the IOSE model we generated represents the only reported cell line model for evaluation of the role of BRD4 in BRD4-amplified ovarian cancers. Concordant gene expression patterns between BRD4-IOSE and BRD4-amplified HGSOC served to support the biological relevance of this system.</p>
<p>NRG1 has been shown to contribute to proliferation, survival and metastasis of ovarian cancer cells. Our study is the first to uncover NRG1 as a transcriptional effector of BRD4. BRD4 binds to NRG1 promoter and enhancer regions in a bromodomain-dependent manner. Interestingly, our data demonstrate that cells expressing the long-isoform of BRD4 are more sensitive to BRD4 depletion at NRG1 promoter and enhancer loci, compared to short-isoform expressing cells. Isoform-specific chromatin binding properties could be mediated through differential interactions at specific loci; elucidating the differences in genome-wide chromatin binding patterns of both BRD4 isoforms will be an important avenue for future studies. Further, we demonstrate that NRG1 signaling is required for BRD4-mediated transformation, and NRG1, in the absence of enforced BRD4 expression, is sufficient to transform IOSE cells. Interrogation of BRD4-amplified HGSOC TCGA data revealed an enriched ERBB2 signature, consistent with activated NRG1 signaling in this tumor subset. Although lapatinib exhibited anti-tumor activity against BRD4-amplified tumor models, and gave significant combination activity with AZD5153, further investigation will be required to interrogate the role of NRG1 as a therapeutic target. Additional experiments that employ NRG1 neutralizing antibodies, and/or HER2/3-specific agents could provide a first step towards this end. In addition, recurrent NRG1 gene fusions have been reported in lung adenocarcinoma; NRG1-altered models may prove useful to further test the applicability of NRG1 as a therapeutic target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref043">43</xref>]. Further, it will be important to assess whether the transcription of NRG1 fusion proteins is mediated through BRD4, and whether BET bromodomain inhibitors could represent a therapeutic option for these patients.</p>
<p>Uncovering the interaction between SWI/SNF components and both isoforms of BRD4, as well as the functional requirement of SWI/SNF activity for BRD4-mediated transformation are additional insights from our study. The pro-tumor role for SWI/SNF defined is distinct from its role as a tumor suppressor as described previously in other cancers, including common ARID1A loss-of-function mutations in ovarian clear cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref044">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref046">46</xref>]. Interestingly, our data demonstrate that in HGSOC, the SWI/SNF complex may function to maintain oncogenic gene expression, similar to what has been previously described in acute myeloid leukemia, where SMARCA4 is necessary to maintain oncogenic MYC expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0200826.ref047">47</xref>]. Correspondingly, we demonstrate that SMARCA4 is necessary to maintain NRG1 transcription in IOSE cells. We speculate that maintenance of NRG1 transcription occurs through chromatin remodeling events, facilitated by interaction between both isoforms of BRD4. Future studies examining the genome-wide, isoform-specific patterns of BRD4 and SWI/SNF chromatin binding could shed additional light on the importance of BRD4-SWI/SNF interactions.</p>
<p>BRD4-amplified HGSOC tumors are mutually exclusive with BRCA1/2 mutations and therefore represent a tumor subtype with few therapeutic options beyond platinum-based chemotherapy. Our study demonstrates the oncogenic activity of BRD4 and positions it as an appropriate therapeutic target in this patient subset. The effectiveness of AZD5153 in BRD4-amplified patient-derived xenografts further establishes a rationale to examine the clinical effectiveness of candidate BET bromodomain inhibitors, such as AZD5153, in BRD4-amplified HGSOC.</p>
