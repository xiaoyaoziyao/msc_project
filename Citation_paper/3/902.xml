<abstract>
<p>Several studies indicated that type 2 diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance are associated with increased colon cancer risk. Recently, studies suggest that metformin can reduce cancer risk in diabetic or non-diabetic patients with unclear mechanisms. This work aimed to determine the effect of metformin on chemically-induced colon cancer in mice. Colon cancer was induced using 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH, 20 mg/kg/week, s.c.) for fifteen weeks. Experiment I: healthy mice were fed with basal diet for four weeks and then allocated into seven groups, (i) saline, (ii) DMH, (iii) oxaliplatin, (iv–v): metformin (100 or 200 mg/kg) and (vi–vii): oxaliplatin+metformin (100 or 200 mg/kg), respectively. Experiment II: type 2 diabetes mellitus was induced by injection of STZ (30 mg/kg) after four weeks of high-fat feeding and then mice were allocated into seven groups similar to those reported in experiment I. Examination of the colonic tissue at the end of the experiment highlighted an increase in angiogenic markers and cell proliferation and showed a greater immunostaining for insulin growth factor I receptors and CD<sub>34</sub> in the colon of diabetic mice compared to non-diabetics. In general, metformin downregulated tumor angiogenesis and augmented the antitumor effect of oxaliplatin. Overall, the current results showed that metformin protected against DMH-induced colon cancer in non-diabetic and diabetic mice. This therapeutic effect was, at least in part, attributed to its anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative mechanisms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cancer is a class of diseases characterized by out-of-control cell growth. Globally, colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in males and the second in females. Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in developed countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Jemal1">[1]</xref>. Colorectal cancers start in the lining of the bowel and if left untreated, it can grow into the muscle layers underneath, and then through the bowel wall.</p>
<p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus has been linked to the increased risk of cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Coughlin1">[2]</xref>. Specifically, higher rates of hepatic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-ElSerag1">[3]</xref>, colon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Larsson1">[4]</xref> and endometrial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Friberg1">[5]</xref> cancer. A meta-analysis was conducted of published data on the association between diabetes and the incidence as well as mortality of colorectal cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Larsson1">[4]</xref>. The factors underlying the increased risk has been postulated but never completely elucidated in the medical literature.</p>
<p>Angiogenesis is the process of generating new capillary blood vessels. Unregulated angiogenesis may cause different pathologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Folkman1">[6]</xref>, such as tumor growth and metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Hanahan1">[7]</xref>. A growing tumor needs capillaries to provide nutrients and oxygen. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a major mediator of vascular permeability and angiogenesis, potentiates microvascular hyperpermeability, which can precede and accompany angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Hoeben1">[8]</xref>. VEGF was found to be higher in sera of children and adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Chiarelli1">[9]</xref> and plays an important role in vascular related diseases including growth of tumors in diabetes mellitus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Ferrara1">[10]</xref>. Accelerated progression of cancer was observed under diabetic and/or hyperglycemic conditions in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Ikemura1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>There is an association between insulin and cancer, hyperinsulinemia induces proliferative tissue abnormalities because insulin has a strong anabolic effect, which results in stimulated DNA synthesis and cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Pollak1">[12]</xref>. This effect may also be explained by the cross-activation of the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Boyd1">[13]</xref>. The IGF signaling system plays an important role in human cancer and the IGF receptor (IGF-R) is an attractive drug target against which a variety of novel anti-tumor agents are being developed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Haisa1">[14]</xref>. Epidemiologic studies have proved a link between elevated IGF level and the development of solid tumors such as colon, breast and prostate cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Arcaro1">[15]</xref>. It is unclear whether IGF-I is a causal factor in colorectal cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Micic1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>Metformin is considered, in addition to lifestyle modification, as a first-line treatment modality for type 2 diabetes mellitus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Micic1">[16]</xref>. Of interest, previous large case-control studies revealed that diabetic patients treated with metformin had a lower incidence of cancers than those treated with other diabetic drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Evans1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Libby1">[19]</xref>. Diabetic patients with breast cancer treated with metformin experienced higher pathologic complete response rates with neoadjuvant chemotherapy than did those treated with other diabetes medications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Jiralerspong1">[20]</xref>. Diverse mechanisms for cancer risk reduction have been hypothesized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-McFarland1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>The current study was designed to compare the severity of experimentally-induced colon cancer in diabetic and non-diabetic mice. Furthermore, the role of metformin in treating DMH-induced colon cancer was investigated in diabetic and non-diabetic mice focusing on its effect on tumor angiogenesis and cell proliferation. Hence, some of the mechanisms of the putative antitumor activity of metformin can be highlighted.</p>

<title>Ethics statement</title>
<p>All the experimental protocols were approved by the Research Ethics Committee at the Faculty of Pharmacy, Suez Canal University.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Experimental animals</title>
<p>Male Swiss albino mice weighing 28–35 g were supplied by the Modern Veterinary Office for Laboratory Animals (Cairo, Egypt). Mice were housed in groups of ten in polyethylene cages under controlled laboratory conditions and normal dark/light cycle. Mice were allowed to acclimatize for one week before starting the experiment. Water and feed ingredients were provided ad libitum during the study period.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Drugs and chemicals</title>
<p>Metformin hydrochloride was kindly provided by Sigma Pharmaceutical Co. (Quesna, Egypt) and dissolved in distilled water. Oxaliplatin (Oxaliplatin, Hospira Inc., IL, Australia) was freshly prepared every week. Streptozotocin (STZ) and 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (MO, USA). STZ was freshly prepared in citrate buffer (0.1 M, pH = 4.5) however; DMH was diluted with phosphate-buffered saline. The feed ingredients such as lard and sucrose were procured from the commercial sources. Citric acid and sodium citrate were supplied by ADWIC Company for chemicals (Cairo, Egypt).</p>

<title>Induction of diabetes and estimation of insulin resistance using the HOMA-IR index</title>
<p>Mice in experiment II were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) which was prepared by mixing 20% sucrose (w/w) and 10% lard (w/w) into basal diet (BD) for four weeks. After that, the mice were fasted overnight then received a single injection of STZ (30 mg/kg, i.p.) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Srinivasan1">[22]</xref> in a volume of 5 ml/kg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100562-g001">Fig.1</xref>). Seven days after STZ administration, mice were fasted overnight and blood glucose level was determined using One Touch Ultra Mini glucometer (USA). In addition, a blood sample was withdrawn from each mouse from the orbital sinus to obtain the serum samples which were kept at −80°C and then used for determination of serum insulin level using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for insulin (Biorbyt, UK) following the manufacturer's protocols. Insulin resistance was estimated using the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index using the formula described previously by Mathew et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Matthews1">[23]</xref>, HOMA-IR index  =  [fasting glucose (mmol/L) × fasting insulin (µU/ml)]/22.5).</p>

<title>Induction of colonic cancer</title>
<p>For induction of colonic cancer, mice were injected subcutaneously with DMH (20 mg/kg/week, body weight) for fifteen weeks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Colussi1">[24]</xref>. Treatment with DMH started one week after STZ injection (i.e.) after the estimation of blood glucose and continued for fifteen weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100562-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2f">
<title>Pharmacological treatments</title>
<p>Treatment with metformin was launched after finishing the course of DMH (i.e. at the beginning of week 21). Metformin treatment (100 or 200 mg/kg) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Rattan1">[25]</xref> was continued for the next four weeks until the mice were killed at the end of the therapeutic period (the end of week 24) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100562-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Mice were monitored daily for any discomfort and weighed every third day to check for tumor growth. For combination therapies, oxaliplatin treatment (4 mg/kg, i.p.) was given on day 7, 14, 21 and 28 in addition to the daily metformin treatment.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2g">
<title>Experimental groups</title>
<p>The current study was carried out on two separate sets of mice; seven groups each. Each group started with ten mice.</p>
<sec id="s2g1">
<title>Experiment I</title>
<p>It was conducted on healthy (<italic>non-diabetic</italic>) mice. Mice were fed with basal diet for four weeks and then allocated into seven groups, (i) Saline, (ii) DMH, (iii) DMH+oxaliplatin, (iv): DMH+metformin (100 mg/kg), (v): DMH+metformin (200 mg/kg), (vi): DMH+oxaliplatin+metformin (100 mg/kg) and (vii): DMH+oxaliplatin+metformin (200 mg/kg).</p>

<title>Experiment II</title>
<p>It was conducted on <italic>diabetic</italic> mice. Type 2 diabetes mellitus was induced by injecting a low of STZ (30 mg/kg) after four weeks of feeding with HFD as mentioned previously and then mice were allocated into seven groups similar to those shown in experiment I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100562-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
</sec></sec><sec id="s2h">
<title>Justification of the dose and schedule of metformin treatment</title>
<p>A typical human treatment dose of metformin is 1000 to 2500 mg, usually given twice daily. In the present study, metformin (100 and 200 mg/kg) was used, and this can be translated to the human equivalent dose by using the Reagan-Shaw method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Reagan1">[26]</xref>. According to the formula the human equivalent dose (mg/kg)  =  animal dose (mg/kg) × animal (km)/human (km). Km for a 60 kg human adults equals 37 and for a 20 g mouse equals 3. Thus the human equivalent of murine dose of 100 and 200 mg/kg are 486 and 973 mg for an average size of 60 kg adult human. Therefore, all the selected doses in the present study are within the safe therapeutic range recorded in humans.</p>
<p>Further, the present study determined the therapeutic period to be 4 weeks to test the antitumor effect of metformin. This was compatible with the therapeutic periods reported in previous studies. For example Ramandeep et al. (2011) studied the effect of a three-week therapeutic regimen of metformin (100 and 200 mg/kg/day, p.o.) in suppressing ovarian cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Rattan2">[27]</xref>. A shorter duration was designed by Liu et al. (2013); the authors determined the effect of metformin (250 mg/kg, i.p.) for fifteen days against renal cell carcinoma in vivo xenografts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Liu1">[28]</xref>. Another study tested the effect of metformin (600 mg/kg/day) for 21 days post inoculation of B16 melanoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Janjetovic1">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>Oxaliplatin was used to be an adjuvant therapy with 5-flourouracil in colorectal carcinoma treatment, and it is a moderately effective drug for treatment when used alone, as oxaliplatin has produced response rates of 12% to 24% in patients with previously untreated advanced colorectal cancer, and 10% to 11% in patients with relapsed or refractory advanced colorectal cancer. In phase II trials, oxaliplatin combined with 5-flourouracil, with or without leucovorin, was associated with response rates of 60%. Therefore, it was supposed that its mild to moderate efficacy in treating this type of cancer will allow the expected effect of metformin to be identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Rothenberg1">[30]</xref>.</p>

<title>Blood collection and sample preparation</title>
<p>At the end of the experiment, mice were anaesthetized with thiopental sodium (50 mg/kg, i.p.) and killed by decapitation. Blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture and centrifuged at 2000×<italic>g</italic> for 15 min - within 30 min after collection of blood samples. Then, sera were separated and collected into two clean Eppendorf's tubes and stored at −20°C until used for the ELISA assays. In addition, tissue specimens from the colon were dissected and fixed in phosphate-buffered formalin (4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH = 7.2) overnight and then embedded in paraffin wax. All paraffin-embedded sections were cut at 4-µm thicknesses and left to dry overnight. Sections were then deparaffinized, rehydrated and prepared for histopathological staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stain for routine examination through the light electric microscope <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Banchroft1">[31]</xref>.</p>

<title>Determination of serum IGF-1 and VEGF by ELISA kits</title>
<p>Serum IGF-1 was determined using mouse IGF-1 ELISA kit (Biorbyt, UK) whereas VEGF was determined using mouse VEGF ELISA kit (Sun Red Biotechnology Company, Shanghai, China); both were determined according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Reactions were assessed by measuring the optical density using an automated ELISA reader at 450 nm.</p>

<title>Histopathological examination of colon tissue</title>
<p>Tissues sections stained with H&amp;E were examined using a light microscope. Each tissue section was first viewed at low power (×10 magnification). Whereas, the scoring was performed blindly by an experienced pathologist at a higher power (×40 magnification). Tumor cells in colon were evaluated using a morphometric point-counting procedure. Grading was conducted according to the degree of dysplasia of cells which is a deviation from normal structure, hyperplasia which is increasing than the normal size of the cells, inflammatory reactions in the mucosal layer which is characterized by inflammatory cells infiltration inflammatory cells aggregation in focal manner, lymphoid proliferation, congestion of blood vessels and fibrosis. 0 =  free from dysplasia, hyperplasia and inflammatory reactions, 1 =  no dysplasia or hyperplasia but mild inflammatory reaction presents, 2 =  moderate inflammatory reaction with or without dysplasia, 3 =  severe inflammatory reaction with dysplasia or hyperplasia or both, 4 =  a very sever inflammatory reaction with fibrosis and dysplastic and hyperplastic activity.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry and image analysis</title>
<p>Briefly, immunostainig was performed using streptavidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase complex method with 4-µm thick sections which have been deparaffinized and heated in 0.01 M citrate buffer solution (pH = 6) for 15 min for antigen retrieval. Sections were then incubated overnight with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against IGF receptor type 1 (IGFR-1) (Biorbyt, UK), mouse monoclonal antibodies against CD<sub>34</sub> (Bio SB, Santa Barbana, USA) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Ki-67 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at 4°C. After conjugation with streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (broad spectrum LAB-SA detection system, Invitrogen), 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB, Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) was used as a chromogen and Mayer's hematoxylin was used as a counterstain. Then, tissue sections were examined using a light microscope and photomicrographs were captured and analyzed using the ImageJ software developed by the National Institute of Health (Bethesda, Maryland, USA). Briefly, the positive DAB stained area, which represent the positive area, in each digital photomicrograph was automatically separated from hematoxylin, which represent the total area, using color deconvolution plugin. Images were then processed into binary color image (black and white). The percentage of positively stained area (represented by the black color) was then determined. Immunoreactivity for IGFR-I, CD<sub>34</sub> and Ki-67 were evaluated in ten consecutive sections representative to the whole tissue section in each.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All results were tabulated and expressed as mean ± S.E.M. For parameters with Gaussian distribution, comparisons between groups were performed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's <italic>post-hoc</italic> test as two independent variables are interacting. Whereas, parameters with non-Gaussian distribution, such as histological scores, were performed by the Kruskal–Wallis test (non-parametric ANOVA) followed by Dunnett's test for multiple comparisons.

<p>After scarification of mice, lesions were in general not visualized by gross examination. However, histological examination revealed that colon mucosa showed hyperplastic and dysplastic epithelial lesions and aberrant crypt foci. Distal colonic mucosa with aberrant crypt foci were difficult to be identified from normal mucosa. Histopathological changes were detected at high magnification; there was a diffuse disturbance of the colon mucosa. Further, the intramucosal foci cells were hypercellular, consisting of large numbers of disorganized epithelial cells; the nuclei were large and hyperchromatic. Isolated islands of preneoplastic cells that were derived from the epithelium were observed with characteristic leukocytic infiltration. The crypts were arranged in a closely packed manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100562-g004">Fig 4A</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>The present study was designed to investigate the anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative effect of metformin in chemically-induced colon cancer in diabetic and non-diabetic mice. First, diabetes was induced by feeding mice with a HFD for four weeks followed by injecting a low dose of STZ. In agreement, Srinivasan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Srinivasan1">[22]</xref> reported that the combination of HFD-fed and low-dose STZ-treated rat serves as an alternative animal model for type 2 diabetes simulating the human syndrome that is also suitable for testing anti-diabetic agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Some clinical data clearly indicate a close link between diabetes and cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Vigneri1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Barone1">[34]</xref>, as these two diseases share many factors that could accelerate the incidence of these diseases but little is known about the mechanism underlying this linkage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Ikemura1">[11]</xref>. For example, type 2 diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance were associated with increased risk of development of breast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Michels1">[35]</xref>, colorectal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Will1">[36]</xref> and pancreas cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Everhart1">[37]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the current study, diabetic mice showed greater serum VEGF and IGF-I values. In accordance, a common polymorphism in the 5′-untranslated region of the VEGF gene was reported to be associated with diabetic retinopathy in type 2 diabetic patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Awata1">[38]</xref> leading to aberrant angiogenesis. IGF-I and insulin offer a more mechanistic explanation for the overlapping risk of cancer in the non-diabetic and diabetic populations. Both are present at high levels in insulin-resistant states, and their receptors are over expressed on the surface of cancer cells associated with diabetes. Thus, they have the potential to act as tumor growth factors in vivo as well as in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Pollak1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Renehan1">[39]</xref>.</p>
<p>Another hypothesis suggest that increased risk of cancer in diabetes may be due to hyperglycemia as cancer cells are characterized by their high metabolic activity and increased glucose requirement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Gerstein1">[40]</xref>. It has been reported that treatment with IGF-I significantly increased the growth of MC38 cell allograft in mice with diet induced obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Hvid1">[41]</xref>. Similarly, it was found that IGF increases cell proliferation in pancreatic tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Kisfalvi1">[42]</xref> and activation of the IGFR-I by IGF-I is associated with the risk and progression of many types of cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Oh1">[43]</xref>.</p>
<p>At the end of the current experiment, injection of DMH reduced serum IGF-I level. This unexpected decrease in serum IGF-I might be attributed to the hepatotoxic effect of DMH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Castleden1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Lewis1">[45]</xref> leading to decreased hepatic production of IGF-I. DMH is a potent necrogenic hepatocarcinogen that alkylates hepatocellular DNA leading to carcinogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Ying1">[46]</xref> it is an aliphatic methylating carcinogen which is metabolized rapidly by the liver causing zonal necrosis and oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Hayes1">[47]</xref>. Therefore, this may explain the reduction in IGF-I levels below normal level after DMH injections as IGF-I is produced primarily by the liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Yilmaz1">[48]</xref>. The current observation that serum IGF-I level in diabetic mice injected with DMH was lower than non-diabetic mice treated with DMH suggests that diabetic mice were greatly susceptible to the hepatotoxic effect of DMH. Importantly, serum level of the other angiogenic marker (VEGF) was greater in diabetic mice compared to the non-diabetics; this was compatible with the present hypothesis that diabetes predisposes to cancer and switches the angiogenic power towards cancer progression.</p>
<p>Further, injection of DMH in mice produced histopathological changes in the distal colon as well as the rectum with multifocal and squamous cell carcinomas. It was previously reported that treatment with DMH resulted in pathophysiological changes in the colon tissue, large protruded tumors in distal colon and smaller tumors in mid colon with rectal bleeding and anal cysts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Colussi1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Jackson1">[49]</xref>. In the current study, diabetic mice did not show a significant increase in mortality due to cancer compared to non-diabetics.</p>
<p>In the current study, the difference between non-diabetic and diabetic mice treated with DMH was tested; this allowed determining the influence of diabetes on tumor growth. The data highlighted greater susceptibility of diabetic mice to the carcinogenic effect of DMH with greater immunostaining for CD<sub>34</sub> and IGFR-1 in colon tissue indicating increased tumor angiogenesis. It is not surprising that diabetes is positively associated with several cancers (hepatic, pancreatic, colon, breast and bladder cancer incidence) which might be attributed to aberrant diabetic angiogenesis. Changes in angiogenesis in diabetic patients are tissue and organ specific. For example angiogenesis might increase in some organs, like the retina, while decrease in others likes the myocardium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Bhattacharyya1">[50]</xref>. The current results are compatible with those reported that type 2 diabetes model KK/A<sup>y</sup>/Tajcl (KK-A<sup>y</sup>) mice develop tumors within a short period after treatment with azoxymethane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Ito1">[51]</xref>. Similarly, several experimental studies reported diabetes as a risk factor for cancer and established a connection between glucose level and the development of micro- and macrovascular complications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Nathan1">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Martin1">[54]</xref> and implicated glucose in the regulation of many endothelial genes related to abnormal angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Stenina1">[55]</xref>. However, specific molecular mechanisms of glucose effects remain poorly studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Bhattacharyya1">[50]</xref>. In addition, hyperglycemia was reported to promote metastasis to the lung in a mouse model of Her2-mediated breast cancer; the authors provided evidence that hyperinsulinemia resulted in larger primary tumors and more aggressive tumors with more numerous pulmonary metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Ferguson1">[56]</xref>.</p>
<p>Recently, Ikemura et al. found that hyperglycemia resulted in increased oxidative stress and accelerated tumor metastasis of Murine melanoma B16-BL6 cells in STZ-diabetic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Ikemura1">[11]</xref>. Similar to the observed increase in tumor vascular density in the present study, Yabe et al. reported oxidative stress in diabetic mice can induce upregulation of the expression of intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and other adhesion molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Yabe1">[57]</xref>. A good explanation for the greater cell proliferation in colon cancer induced in diabetic mice is that hyperglycemia would provide favorable conditions for the proliferation of tumor cells; the Authors recorded increased proliferation of tumor cells in culture media containing plasma from diabetic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Ikemura1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the current study, treatment with the chemotherapeutic agent, oxaliplatin, provided a moderate reduction in DMH-induced colon cancer in both diabetic and non-diabetic mice without increasing survival. Indeed, several clinical studies used oxaliplatin in treatment of colorectal cancer combined with 5-flourouracil to improve survival rates as it was used as adjuvant therapy to enhance 5-flourouracil performance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-DeGramont1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Giacchetti1">[59]</xref>.</p>
<p>The current study tested metformin in combination with oxaliplatin which is known to be moderately effective against colorectal carcinoma. It was found that monotherapy with two dose levels of metformin moderately suppressed the tumor severity as indicated by H&amp;E staining for colon tissues. Further, metformin suppressed serum VEGF and intratumoral cell proliferation. However, intratumoral vascular density was lessened by metformin in diabetic mice (27.69% and 26.15%) to a much greater extent compared to non-diabetics (7.04% and 25.35%). This indicates that metformin treatment reduced the severity of the colorectal tumor, thereby restricting the cell proliferation and angiogenesis. We found that metformin use was associated with less cancer-related mortality in diabetic mice.</p>
<p>In accordance, several studies highlighted that metformin can target cancer-initiating cells. Metformin inhibited the growth of a subpopulation of breast cancer. Cells shown to have such property in culture and reduced their ability to form tumors in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Hirsch1">[60]</xref>. Metformin suppressed the development of breast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Anisimov1">[61]</xref>, chemically induced lung tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Memmott1">[62]</xref>, hepatocellular carcinoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Saito1">[63]</xref>, colon cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Tomimoto1">[64]</xref> and preneoplastic colonic lesions in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Hosono1">[65]</xref> and ovarian cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Shank1">[66]</xref>.</p>
<p>Clinical studies reported that patients with type 2 diabetes who were not taking metformin showed an increased cancer mortality ratio compared with that for those receiving metformin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100562-Landman1">[67]</xref>. Notably, metformin mediates an approximately 30% reduction in the lifetime risk of cancer in diabetic patients. There is growing recognition that metformin may act (1) directly on cancer cells, primarily by impacting mitochondrial respiration leading to the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which controls energy homeostasis in cells, but also through other mechanisms or (2) indirectly on the host metabolism, largely through AMPK-mediated reduction in hepatic gluconeogenesis, leading to reduced circulating insulin levels and decreased insulin/IGF-I receptor-mediated activation of the PI3K pathway.</p>
<p>Two different doses of metformin were added to oxaliplatin to investigate the effect of this combination on survival percent and reduction of tumor severity compared to monotherapy with oxaliplatin. The current study found that addition of metformin to oxaliplatin generally augmented the anti-tumor effect of the later and produced further reduction in serum VEGF, downregulated intratumoral IGFR-I and intra-tumoral vascular density. However, the effect on tumoral cell proliferation was potentiated only when the high dose of metformin is combined with oxaliplatin in diabetic mice, however, a similar potentiation was not observed in non-diabetic mice.</p>
<p>The current results demonstrated that diabetic mice had higher susceptibility to DMH-induced colon cancer compared to non-diabetics; supporting the idea that diabetes carries the risk of colon cancer. Monotherapy with metformin successfully ameliorated many of the measured tumor markers, downregulated tumor angiogenesis and cell proliferation. Hence, the current data support the view that metformin's action against tumor growth is, at least in part, linked to anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative mechanisms. Further studies are still needed to monitor the adverse effects of these drug combinations and to determine the causes of mortality during these therapeutic regimens.</p>
