<abstract>
<p>The common vole (<italic>Microtus arvalis</italic>) has been a model species of small mammal for studying end-glacial colonization history. In the present study we expanded the sampling from central and eastern Europe, analyzing contemporary genetic structure to identify the role of a potential ‘northern glacial refugium’, i.e. a refugium at a higher latitude than the traditional Mediterranean refugia. Altogether we analyzed 786 cytochrome <italic>b</italic> (cyt<italic>b</italic>) sequences (representing mitochondrial DNA; mtDNA) from the whole of Europe, adding 177 new sequences from central and eastern Europe, and we conducted analyses on eight microsatellite loci for 499 individuals (representing nuclear DNA) from central and eastern Europe, adding data on 311 new specimens. Our new data fill gaps in the vicinity of the Carpathian Mountains, the potential northern refugium, such that there is now dense sampling from the Balkans to the Baltic Sea. Here we present evidence that the Eastern mtDNA lineage of the common vole was present in the vicinity of this Carpathian refugium during the Last Glacial Maximum and the Younger Dryas. The Eastern lineage expanded from this refugium to the Baltic and shows low cyt<italic>b</italic> nucleotide diversity in those most northerly parts of the distribution. Analyses of microsatellites revealed a similar pattern but also showed little differentiation between all of the populations sampled in central and eastern Europe.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Phylogeography is a discipline which uses molecular markers to infer population movements at the end of the Pleistocene and during the Holocene, to identify where glacial refugia were located and to establish genetic characteristics of present-day populations, including geographic barriers obstructing gene flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref001">1</xref>]. Therefore, phylogeography attempts to reconstruct the history of contemporary species distributions and explain the partitioning of genetic variation within them. Europe is one of the most comprehensively studied regions in the context of Pleistocene phylogeography.</p>
<p>During the Pleistocene in Europe there were three substantial glacial periods, separated by warmer interglacials: the Elster glaciation (730–430 kya, thousands of years ago), the Saale glaciation (300–130 kya) and the Weichselian (or Vistulian) glaciation (115–11.5 kya) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref002">2</xref>]. Considering the Weichselian, the ice cover in Europe reached its maximum extent around 27.5–19 kya and this time point is known as the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref003">3</xref>]. The Scandinavian ice sheet, that dominated northern Europe at the LGM, reached parts of the British Isles, Germany, Poland and Russia, while neighboring regions suffered tundra conditions at this time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref005">5</xref>]. More favorable conditions for temperate species were present on the three Mediterranean peninsulas (Iberian, Apennine and Balkan), which played the role of refugial areas, where many species survived cold periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref008">8</xref>]. Additionally, there is evidence that some temperate species also survived in more northerly areas, such as the Carpathian Basin, parts of present-day France, the Ural Mountains and the Russian Plains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref016">16</xref>]. After the LGM there was a warmer phase designated the Bølling-Allerød interstadial (14.7–12.7 kya), when deglaciation occurred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref018">18</xref>]. However, the retreat of the glaciers caused many icebergs to discharge into the ocean, disrupting the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and resulting in further cooling of the climate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref020">20</xref>]. Consequently, the Pleistocene ended with a short cold phase, known as the Younger Dryas (YD; 12.9–11.7 kya) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>The common vole <italic>Microtus arvalis</italic> (Pallas, 1778) is one of the best studied small mammal species in Europe, in terms of phylogeography and population genetics. The common vole comprises two parapatric chromosomal races which are often considered subspecies, or even species, with the names <italic>M</italic>. <italic>arvalis</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>obscurus</italic> (Eversmann, 1841) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168621.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The two forms may be distinguished both from their karyotypes and mitochondrial cytochrome <italic>b</italic> (cyt<italic>b</italic>) variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref025">25</xref>]. In this study we focus on the nominate form, for which six mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages have been described, based on cyt<italic>b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168621.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Previous studies on the phylogeography of this species suggest that mtDNA is an excellent marker for identification of its glacial refugia and study of its range expansion, as in the case of its sympatric congener, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>agrestis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref027">27</xref>]. Three of the mtDNA lineages probably originated from southern refugia (the Western-South lineage from the Iberian Peninsula, the Italian lineage and the Balkan lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref029">29</xref>]) while three lineages probably originated in northern refugia (the Western-North lineage from a refugium located in the vicinity of central France, the Central lineage from a refugium close to the Alps and the Eastern lineage, which may have been derived from the vicinity of the Carpathian Mountains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref031">31</xref>]).</p>

<p>Previous studies of the Eastern lineage have been geographically limited, confined mainly to Poland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref030">30</xref>]. Based on these studies, it has previously been inferred that this lineage originated in the Carpathians, because of its distribution and the presence of fossils in the region over the last 25 000 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref033">33</xref>]. Earlier microsatellite analyses revealed subdivision of the Eastern mtDNA lineage into two genetic groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref034">34</xref>]. Given the results of the earlier studies from Poland, placed in the wider context of what is known about the common vole, the Eastern lineage is an excellent model system for an in-depth study of a small mammal population which potentially derives from a northern glacial refugium. Here, we collected many more individuals from central and eastern Europe to increase the range and number of individuals sampled. We analyzed 318 individuals from 140 locations in 13 countries, allowing us to determine the entire range of the Eastern lineage, and to more accurately identify both its refugial history and the subsequent expansion and re-colonization pattern of the species in this part of Europe.</p>
<p>Specifically, this broad sampling allows us to consider the following questions relating to occupation of northern glacial refugia by the common vole: (i) Is the pattern of mitochondrial and microsatellite variation consistent with the Eastern lineage deriving from the Carpathian Basin, as opposed to a refugium or refugia located elsewhere? (ii) How does the timing of expansion of the Eastern lineage relate to events during the last glaciation, particularly the LGM? (iii) Is the differentiation that is evident in Poland, based on microsatellite variation, replicated at a wider scale in the Eastern lineage and what is the implication for the refugial population and its subsequent expansion? Overall, the level and density of sampling in the area surrounding this northern refugium provides an exceptionally detailed perspective on the relationship between genetic variation in a contemporary population and the refugium, or refugia, from which it originated.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>All capture and handling procedures of voles in Poland were approved by the Local Ethics Committee for Animal Experiments in Białystok (Decision no: 5/2013). Samples of voles from Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia were collected according to the Legislation of Nature Protection and Legislation of Animal Welfare valid in these countries and permission to the Slovenian Museum of Natural History given by the Veterinary Administration of the Republic of Slovenia. No additional permits from Ethics Committee were needed. All capture and handling procedures of the common voles from Russia and Ukraine were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the A.N. Severtsov Institute of Ecology and Evolution of the Russian Academy of Sciences (official letter from the deputy director of the Institute, no: 3485/09). No additional permits were required. Permission from the landowners was obtained where necessary. Samples were not collected from protected locations and field studies did not involve endangered, threatened or protected species.</p>

<title>Mitochondrial DNA</title>
<p>We obtained new mtDNA data from 177 samples of the common vole from Poland, Belarus, Russia, Moldova, Ukraine, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Romania, and Serbia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168621.g001">Fig 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168621.s007">S1 Table</xref>). Samples were collected between 1995 and 2015 and preserved in 96–98% ethanol. Additionally, our collection included samples from central and southern Ukraine and Armenia but all of them appeared to be the southern vole (<italic>Microtus rossiaemeridionalis</italic>), a sibling species almost identical in morphology to the common vole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref035">35</xref>]. We obtained 13 complete cyt<italic>b</italic> sequences from those samples and they were identified using BLAST (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi" xlink:type="simple">https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi</ext-link>). They were not included further in the analyses performed in this study. The sequences obtained were deposited in GenBank (accession numbers: KX380179-KX380191).</p>
<p>Total genomic DNA was extracted using Syngen Tissue DNA Mini Kit in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The amplification and sequencing of the complete cyt<italic>b</italic> sequence (1143 bp) were conducted according to methods described by Wójcik et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref010">10</xref>], using primers described by Stojak et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref030">30</xref>], in two overlapping fragments, each 500–600 bp in length. We also included negative PCR controls without template DNA. Additionally, we used 609 sequences obtained from previous studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168621.g001">Fig 1A</xref>; for the whole list of locations see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168621.s007">S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168621.s008">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168621.s010">S4</xref> Tables in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref030">30</xref>]). In all, we analyzed cyt<italic>b</italic> sequences from 786 individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168621.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168621.s007">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168621.s008">S2</xref> Tables).</p>
<p>The nucleotide sequences were aligned and manually checked in BioEdit 7.2.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref036">36</xref>]. As in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref030">30</xref>], the complete alignment was shortened to 1000 bp. The distribution of polymorphic nucleotide and amino acid sites, number of transversions and transitions, synonymous and non-synonymous changes and position of stop codons in cyt<italic>b</italic> sequences obtained from newly-collected individuals were determined in DnaSP 5.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref037">37</xref>] using the method of Degli Esposti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref038">38</xref>].</p>
<p>A median-joining network was constructed for all 786 sequences in Network 4.6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref039">39</xref>], to establish the overall pattern of mitochondrial genetic variation in the species.</p>
<p>We used Bayesian genealogy sampling in BEAST 1.8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref040">40</xref>], with all 786 sequences, to estimate the time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) for each lineage. The analysis was carried out according to the procedure described by Stojak et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref030">30</xref>], using the HKY+Γ substitution model. A strict molecular clock was compared with an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref041">41</xref>]. Two demographic models were tested: skyline and constant population size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref042">42</xref>]. For model selection, path sampling and stepping-stone sampling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref043">43</xref>] were used to estimate marginal likelihoods (MLEs) for each model, based on four independent MCMC chains, each comprising 1000 steps of 100 000 generations, following 10 million generations burn-in. In each case, sampling was considered sufficient, as the estimates from the two methods (path sampling and stepping-stone sampling) converged on similar values. The MLEs were then used to obtain the Bayes Factor for each comparison to determine the best-fitting model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref044">44</xref>]. The previously estimated clock rate of 3.27 x 10<sup>−7</sup> substitutions/site/year<sup>-1</sup> was used to calibrate the genealogy and date tMRCAs of each lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref030">30</xref>]. Posterior distributions of tMRCA and other model parameters were obtained from four independent MCMC simulations (each run for 200 million generations, with effective sample size for each parameter over 200), using TRACER 1.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref045">45</xref>]. Posterior samples from the four chains were combined, using LogCombiner, part of the BEAST package. The Maximum Clade Credibility (MCC) tree was obtained using TreeAnnotator, part of the BEAST package, and visualized with FigTree 1.4 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tree-bio.ed.ac.uk/" xlink:type="simple">http://tree-bio.ed.ac.uk/</ext-link>). The analyses were repeated without sequence data to test the effect of the joint prior distributions on the posterior distributions for each parameter of interest.</p>
<p>Nucleotide and haplotype diversity were calculated in DnaSP. To test for recent population expansion in mitochondrial lineages, we applied three tests in Arlequin 3.5.1.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref046">46</xref>]: Tajima’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref047">47</xref>] <italic>D</italic> and Fu’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref048">48</xref>] <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> statistics and the mismatch distribution using sum of squared deviations SSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref049">49</xref>], with significance inferred using 1000 bootstrap replicates. Subsequently, we calculated time since expansion for lineages in which all three tests confirmed recent expansion (Tajima’s <italic>D</italic> and Fu’s <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> significant, SSD not significant; see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref050">50</xref>]). The estimate was calculated according to a method based on the Tau value (Tau = 2ut, where u is the mutation rate and t is the mean generation time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref051">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref052">52</xref>]) using an online tool described by Schenekar and Weiss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref053">53</xref>] (mismatch calculator, kindly provided by Stephen Weiss). Tau values were calculated in Arlequin, the substitution rate of 3.27 x 10<sup>-7</sup>substitutions/site/year<sup>-1</sup> was applied and the generation time was assumed to be one year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref030">30</xref>]. To examine the demographic expansion of the Eastern lineage, a Bayesian skyline plot was prepared in TRACER, according to the method described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref030">30</xref>]. In this analysis we used all 318 sequences belonging to this lineage.</p>
<p>Geographic variation in nucleotide diversity (π) for the Eastern lineage was mapped with interpolation using ArcGIS 10.3.1 Geostatistical Analyst (ArcGIS Desktop: Release 10.3 Redlands, CA: Environmental Systems Research Institute 2015). Populations with only one individual were excluded to avoid cases where π is equal to 0. Altogether we used 293 sequences from 74 populations. Interpolation was carried out using an Inverse Distance Weight model (IDW, power = 1, based on 12 neighbors) which uses a linear-weighted combination set of sample points, assigned as a function of the distance of an input point from the output cell location. This means that the greater the distance is, the less influence the input cell obtained has on the results.</p>

<title>Microsatellite DNA</title>
<p>We used 311 new specimens for microsatellite analysis, obtained from the Carpathian Basin, Russia and the Balkans, together with 188 specimens which were already analyzed in the previous study of Stojak et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref034">34</xref>]. We initially used the previous panel of 11 microsatellite loci as described by Stojak et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref034">34</xref>], following the same protocols. However, this was reduced for this study by the exclusion of loci AV12, Moe5 and MSM2, due to excessive missing data or risk in identification of false alleles as a result of non-specific amplification. Negative PCR controls without template DNA were included for each set of samples and each multiplex. We repeated the PCR for 15% of samples to test for error. All genotypes were independently scored three times. Altogether, we conducted the study on 499 individuals from 61 localities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168621.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Sample sizes for populations varied, ranging from 1–16 individuals. A complete list of populations, localities and number of individuals are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168621.s009">S3 Table</xref>.</p>
<p>Only populations with five or more individuals were included in all population-level analyses. Observed (H<sub>O</sub>) and expected heterozygosity (H<sub>E</sub>) were calculated in Arlequin. FSTAT v. 2.9.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref054">54</xref>] was used to determine deviations from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), allelic richness (AR) and to test for linkage disequilibrium between all pairs of loci in each population (using 10,000 simulations). Null alleles were identified in Micro-Checker v. 2.2.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref055">55</xref>]. Pairwise F<sub>ST</sub> values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref056">56</xref>] between populations within each species were estimated in FSTAT, determining significance using 10,000 permutations under sequential Bonferroni corrections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref057">57</xref>]. The relationship between pairwise genetic (F<sub>ST</sub>) and geographic distances was tested using a Mantel test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref058">58</xref>] in IBDWS v. 3.23 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref059">59</xref>].</p>
<p>To establish the number of genetic clusters occurring across central Europe we initially used Bayesian analysis in STRUCTURE 2.3.4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref060">60</xref>]. Ten independent runs of 500,000 generations with 100,000 generations of burn-in were performed for each value of <italic>K</italic> (1–20) under the admixture model and with the assumption that allele frequencies among populations are correlated. The optimal number of clusters were identified using the Evanno method (Δ<italic>K</italic>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref061">61</xref>]) and mean posterior probability of the data (Ln(<italic>K</italic>); log probability). Calculations were conducted in STRUCTURE HARVESTER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref062">62</xref>]. We assigned populations to a particular cluster according to assignment probability <italic>q</italic> ≥ 0.8. Populations with assignment probability of 0.2 &lt; <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.8 were classified as ‘intermediate’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref063">63</xref>]. We used Clumpp 1.1.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref064">64</xref>] and Distruct 1.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref065">65</xref>] to assemble 10 independent runs of best-fitting values of <italic>K</italic> and to generate graphical representations.</p>
<p>Additionally, we performed Spatial Principal Components Analysis (sPCA; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref066">66</xref>]) in R studio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref067">67</xref>], to describe genetic differentiation and identify potential genetic structure across all populations from central Europe. Within that package, a G test was used to check for global (overall) structure and an L test for local (smaller scale) structure. Both tests were conducted using 999 permutations. The algorithm used in sPCA is modified such that the principal axes maximize spatial autocorrelation instead of correlation. Unlike methods such as STRUCTURE, sPCA does not take into consideration Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) or the extent of linkage disequilibrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref066">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref068">68</xref>].</p>
<p>Interpolation of allelic richness (AR) and expected heterozygosity (H<sub>E</sub>) were conducted for 42 populations to identify potential hotspots of genetic diversity to complement the nucleotide diversity analysis with cyt<italic>b</italic>. Only populations with 5 or more individuals were included. Two Russian populations were excluded from this analysis because they were geographically distant from all the other populations. Analyses were carried out using ArcGIS 10.3.1, adopting the same model as for cyt<italic>b</italic>.</p>

<title>Mitochondrial cyt<italic>b</italic> sequences</title>
<p>Amplification of the complete cyt<italic>b</italic> sequence (1143 bp) was successful for all 177 new samples of the common vole (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168621.s007">S1 Table</xref>). We found no contamination in negative controls. The distribution of polymorphic nucleotide sites showed that substitutions are mostly in the third codon position, with a higher ratio of transitions (106Ts:13Tv; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168621.s010">S4 Table</xref>). Non-synonymous changes occurred at the first codon position more often than at the second. Substitutions were mostly in the third codon position, with a higher ratio of transitions and only one (final) stop codon was identified (nucleotide positions 1141–1143). We found a much higher number of synonymous than non-synonymous changes (99: 20). These results are in agreement with a pattern that has been previously described by Irwin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref069">69</xref>] in mammals (and other taxa).</p>
<p>The 177 new sequences had 126 polymorphic sites, 85 of which were phylogenetically informative, and 97 haplotypes were identified. All 786 sequences analyzed contained 267 polymorphic sites, 181 of which were phylogenetically informative, and 309 haplotypes were identified. No nuclear mitochondrial DNA segments (numts) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref070">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref071">71</xref>] were found. PCR amplifications always produced only one band and we found no ambiguities in the sequences obtained–there were no unexpected stop codons, deletions, insertions or changes in the reading frame; all sequences were in concordance with the rest of cyt<italic>b</italic> sequences of the common vole from GenBank.</p>
<p>The network analysis allowed us to assign the new sequences to the six previously described mtDNA lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref072">72</xref>]. Eight new sequences from the Balkan region were assigned to the Balkan lineage, three from north-western Poland to the Central lineage and the remaining 166 to the Eastern lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168621.g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p>

<p>In the cyt<italic>b</italic> genealogy, illustrated by the MCC tree and obtained from MCMC simulations with a coalescent model, all of the sequences were again included in the six previously identified lineages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168621.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Using all 786 sequences, the marginal likelihood estimates (MLEs) for skyline and constant population size demographic models were -9474.7 and -9684.5, respectively. A coalescent skyline model was therefore chosen over a constant population size model (Bayes Factors BF: 209.8) and an uncorrelated relaxed lognormal molecular clock was chosen over a strict molecular clock (MLEs: -9474.7 and -9509.4 respectively; BF: 34.7). In the Bayesian genealogy, all six lineages were highly supported (posterior probabilities either 0.99 or 1.0). While the Balkan and Italian lineages were entirely distinct from all of the other lineages, the Western-North and Western-South lineages formed a distinct and well-supported clade (PP = 0.95), as did the Central and Eastern lineages (PP = 0.99). The deeper splits in the genealogy were not supported and the relationship between the lineages is therefore uncertain.</p>
<p>The root of the genealogy was dated to 67.0 kya (with lower and upper 95% highest posterior density HPD limits of 41.8 and 104.5 kya, respectively;<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0168621.t001">Table 1</xref>). The Eastern lineage, which is the lineage of main interest here, had a tMRCA estimate of 22.4 kya (95% HPD: 13.5–29.8 kya). The two Western lineages had similar tMRCA estimates of approximately 25 kya (95% HDP: 12.7–36.0 kya for Western-North and 12.0–37.5 kya for Western-South) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0168621.t001">Table 1</xref>). The Balkan lineage had a tMRCA of 18.2 kya (95% HPD: 8.5–28.7 kya), whereas the tMRCAs of the Italian and Central lineages were 13.9 kya (95% HPD: 5.9–20.4 kya) and 16.3 kya (95% HPD: 8.5–22.6 kya), respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0168621.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Genetic variation in the three lineages from eastern Europe, which are those of interest here, is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0168621.t002">Table 2</xref>. Nucleotide diversity (range: 0.0050–0.0073) and haplotype diversity (range: 0.960–0.977) were highest for the Eastern lineage and lowest for the Central lineage. The Central and Eastern lineages had significant values of Tajima’s <italic>D</italic> and Fu’s <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> and non-significant SSD values, all of which indicate recent demographic expansion. Based on the mismatch Tau values, the Central lineage began to expand 6.3 kya (95% CI: 3.7–10.7 kya) and the Eastern lineage 8.3 kya (95% CI: 4.8–13.9 kya).

<title>Microsatellites</title>
<p>We analyzed eight microsatellite loci in 499 individuals of the common vole (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168621.s011">S5 Table</xref>). There were only 0.33% missing data among all samples. No errors were found in the re-genotyped individuals. The estimates for H<sub>O</sub> and H<sub>E,</sub> together with the identification of null alleles, are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168621.s012">S6 Table</xref>. The diversity ranged from 0.535–0.903 (H<sub>O</sub>) and 0.581–0.925 (H<sub>E</sub>). Null alleles were identified only for Moe6 in a few populations. As this locus had little influence on the overall results, it was not excluded from further analyses (see below).</p>
<p>At the population level, values of allelic richness (AR), observed heterozygosity (H<sub>O</sub>) and expected heterozygosity (H<sub>E</sub>) varied from 4.49–7.47, 0.667–0.925 and 0.768–0.916, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168621.s009">S3 Table</xref>). Only five populations significantly differed from HWE expectations after Bonferroni correction. Tests of linkage disequilibrium over all populations revealed significant linkage at all loci for two populations from Aleksinac (Serbia) and Česky Dub (Czech Republic).</p>
<p>Overall population differentiation was rather low (F<sub>ST</sub> = 0.040, 95% CI: 0.032–0.048) and this value is nearly identical after removing the Moe6 locus (F<sub>ST</sub> = 0.041, 95% CI: 0.031–0.050). There was significant differentiation between some pairs of populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168621.s013">S7 Table</xref>). A Mantel test of the relationship between genetic and geographic distances revealed a weak and non-significant isolation by distance pattern for the common vole in central and eastern Europe <italic>(r =</italic> 0.1725, P = 0.068). This overall pattern of genetic differentiation is consistent with that from earlier studies of the common vole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref034">34</xref>].</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The common vole <italic>Microtus arvalis</italic> is a particularly well-studied phylogeographic model species in Europe. A number of previous studies have revealed multiple mtDNA lineages of this species, based on cyt<italic>b</italic> sequences, and the distribution of these lineages has been related to end-glacial biogeographic history [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref072">72</xref>]. The use of other genetic markers, such as microsatellites or those on the Y-chromosome, have generally revealed patterns congruent to those found with mtDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref073">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref074">74</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we substantially enhanced the geographic coverage of cyt<italic>b</italic> sequences of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>arvalis</italic> in central and eastern Europe. In our analysis of cyt<italic>b</italic>, we made use of all 786 sequences available (including the samples in this paper and in GenBank) to confirm the six mtDNA lineages previously described in the species (Western-South, Western-North, Italian, Central, Eastern and Balkan; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168621.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Our material also included samples from central and southern Ukraine and Armenia but all of them appeared to be from the southern vole (<italic>Microtus rossiaemeridionalis</italic>), a sibling species almost identical in morphology to the common vole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref035">35</xref>], suggesting that the range of the common vole does not extend into these areas.</p>
<p>While European temperate species were traditionally thought to have occupied Mediterranean glacial refugia, the possibility of more northerly refugia has been promoted since the 1980s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref016">16</xref>], however studies of present-day populations in the vicinity of these refugia and expansion routes from them have not been exceptionally detailed. The common vole lineages which may derive from such northern refugia are the Western-North lineage (with a refugium located somewhere in central France; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref028">28</xref>]), the Central lineage (with a refugium located somewhere in the Alpine region; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref073">73</xref>]) and the Eastern lineage (with a refugium located in the Carpathians; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref030">30</xref>]). However, the status of any of these putative common vole refugia, as a source for contemporary genetic variation, has not been thoroughly examined. The Eastern lineage and the status of its proposed Carpathian refugium are the focus of the present study. The existence of northern refugia is very interesting in a physiological sense, as the survival of a temperate species in these refugia would suggest that it has high resistance to the severe, dry and sub-arctic climatic conditions present at such latitudes during the LGM and Younger Dryas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref022">22</xref>]. Such populations may have been able to expand rapidly on amelioration of the climate after the end of the cold period. Northern refugia may therefore have made a substantial contribution to the contemporary genetic diversity of high latitudes in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>We analyzed 318 cyt<italic>b</italic> sequences from the Eastern lineage, with excellent coverage of its distribution between the Balkans and Baltic Sea. This area which would have been affected by severe glacial conditions during the LGM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref005">5</xref>], but nevertheless includes the vicinity of the Carpathian Mountains, proposed as a refugium for a variety of animals and plants, including hornbeam (<italic>Carpinus betulus</italic>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref013">13</xref>]), crested newt (<italic>Triturus cristatus</italic>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref075">75</xref>]) and brown bear (<italic>Ursus arctos</italic>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref076">76</xref>]). The Carpathian region has a well-established fossil history, including remains of common voles and other small mammals, from the time of the LGM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref033">33</xref>].</p>
<p>To address the first question of our study, we tested several properties of the Eastern lineage, to establish if the pattern of its mitochondrial variation is consistent with its derivation from a refugium located in the vicinity of the Carpathian Mountains. The distribution of the lineage clearly supports this hypothesis, as it is present in a wide area of central Europe, with the Carpathians in the centre of its range. Moreover, we observed a continuous spread of the lineage north of the Carpathians. Three diversity indices also provide evidence in support of the hypothesis (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168621.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168621.g005">5</xref>). Relatively high levels of genetic diversity are expected in refugial areas for temperate species, due to the survival of large, demographically stable populations over a long period of past climatic oscillations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref077">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref078">78</xref>]. Here we show, using both mtDNA (nucleotide diversity) and microsatellite markers (allelic richness and expected heterozygosity) that there are hotspots of genetic diversity for the common vole in the Carpathians and their close proximity. The interpolations and plots showed a distinct reduction of genetic diversity with distance from the Carpathian Basin and are also consistent with a northward route of re-colonization from there (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168621.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168621.g005">5</xref>). Another, previously proposed, refugial area for this lineage is the Balkan Peninsula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref024">24</xref>], but this seems unlikely as this area is occupied by another mtDNA lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref029">29</xref>]. Although there are fossil records of the common vole from the vicinity of the Carpathians at the time of the LGM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref033">33</xref>], ancient bone fragments without associated DNA cannot give an indication of which lineage was present at that time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref079">79</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref081">81</xref>]. A very similar pattern of contemporary DNA variation to that of the common vole is observed in the bank vole where the ‘Carpathian’ lineage is more widespread in central Europe than the ‘Balkan’ lineage, which is present only in close proximity to its refugial area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref009">9</xref>]. In the case of the bank vole, gene flow and demographic expansion were also observed from the Carpathian region to the south, not only northwards. This pattern was inferred using an isolation by migration (IM) model, which employs a Bayesian coalescent method and relies on the assumption that there is continuing gene flow between the two descendant populations which were derived from the split of the ancestral population. The estimated rate of gene flow into the ‘Carpathian’ lineage was equal to zero, while the gene flow outward from this lineage was significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>It may be also hypothesized that the Eastern lineage of the common vole derived from refugia located somewhere close to the Ural Mountains or the Russian Plains and spread from such distant areas to central Europe after the LGM. For instance, Deffontaine et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref082">82</xref>] suggested that the Eastern clade of the bank vole most likely derived from a refugium in the vicinity of the Urals and expanded its range to central Europe. However, the range of the Eastern lineage of the common vole does not include areas to the east of the Vladimir region, where the <italic>obscurus</italic> chromosome race occurs. Therefore, this hypothesis does not seem to be supported.</p>
<p>The second purpose of our study was to establish the timing of expansion of the Eastern lineage and to determine how it relates to events which occurred during the last glaciation. Coalescent genealogy sampling in BEAST, using the molecular clock rate that was established from common vole ancient DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref028">28</xref>], inferred a median tMRCA for the Eastern lineage of 22.4 kya (95% HPD limits of 13.5 and 29.8 kya). This indicates that the Eastern lineage originated from a genetic bottleneck around the time of the LGM, when the species was known to be present in the Carpathians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref033">33</xref>]. Based on the mismatch Tau value, the median time for the onset of expansion of the Eastern lineage was 8.3 kya (95% CI from 4.8 to 13.9 kya). This date is broadly consistent with the time of demographic expansion that was estimated from coalescent genealogy sampling, in the present and earlier studies, at around 10 kya (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168621.s002">S2 Fig</xref>, also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168621.g004">Fig 4</xref> in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref030">30</xref>]). These various estimates suggest that the Eastern lineage of the common vole was present in the Carpathian Basin during both the LGM and YD periods and re-colonized central and eastern Europe from this refugium at the beginning of the Holocene, after the last glacial retreat.</p>
<p>The final purpose of our study was to determine if the microsatellite differentiation that we found in our previous study of genetic variation in common voles from Poland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref034">34</xref>] would be confirmed in a broader area of central Europe and, if so, what information it reveals about the population history of the species in the region. The previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref034">34</xref>] described an eastern-western subdivision in Poland for both <italic>M</italic>. <italic>arvalis</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>agrestis</italic>. In this study, STRUCTURE analysis with samples of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>arvalis</italic> suggested that this pattern is also evident on a wider scale in central Europe. The eastern group occurs across eastern Poland, eastern Hungary, Russia and Serbia and the western group is present in western Poland, western Hungary and the Czech Republic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168621.g004">Fig 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168621.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Again, as in the previous study, there were mixed (presumably hybrid) populations with intermediate levels of assignation to one of the two genetic groups. These populations are located between the eastern and western groups, in a broad contact zone (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168621.g004">Fig 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168621.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). However, there is a need to be cautious with the STRUCTURE results, because three possible values of <italic>K</italic> or genetic clusters (<italic>K</italic> = 2, 3 or 9) were inferred. The choice of <italic>K</italic> = 2 is based on the <italic>a priori</italic> data from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref034">34</xref>], and cannot therefore be viewed as definitive. Results from a second spatial genetics program, sPCA, showed very weak differentiation between all populations across central Europe. The sPCA revealed no genetic structure and no division into genetic groups was indicated (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168621.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). These results were supported by low overall differentiation (F<sub>ST</sub> = 0.04) and significant differentiation between only some pairs of populations. There was a similar lack of confirmation of the STRUCTURE results in the previous study within Poland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref034">34</xref>], where STRUCTURE revealed two genetic groups in Poland but Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC) showed weak differentiation across the country.</p>
<p>This study is the first to examine genetic variation, using microsatellite data, in common vole populations from a wide area of central Europe. Previous studies were confined to western Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref031">31</xref>]. The samples used in these microsatellite analyses were collected from an area where the Eastern mtDNA lineage predominates, and only five populations from north-western Poland were assigned to the Central mtDNA lineage. As in our earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref034">34</xref>], we did not find congruence between the mtDNA and microsatellite results, as the few Central lineage populations were not distinctive from the Eastern lineage. This differs from what has been found in Switzerland, where microsatellites also show differentiation in the contact zone of the Central and Western mtDNA lineages of common vole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref073">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref074">74</xref>]. The number of loci used in the different studies is similar: eight loci in this study, 11 loci in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref034">34</xref>] and 12 loci in the study in Switzerland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref031">31</xref>]. Given that relatively few samples that were not from the Eastern lineage were examined in our study, it is unwise to use our data to make strong statements about differentiation between lineages. However, we are in a position to discuss the degree of substructure within the Eastern lineage.</p>
<p>We assume that the weak eastern-western effect may reflect historical or ecological factors that influenced the common vole in this region. Division into two genetic groups may have resulted from environmental factors during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. During the YD river corridors were very broad and covered by permafrost patches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref083">83</xref>] and probably the Vistula river was a geographic barrier hindering gene flow between vole populations during that time. Around 10 kya, during the period of rapid warming at the beginning of the Holocene, deciduous forest expanded and the Polish territory became influenced by oceanic climate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref084">84</xref>]. This resulted in flooding over a large area, which could have formed a barrier to re-colonization in the common vole. The middle Vistula river valley, built of sand dunes, was mostly reshaped by wind between 10.7 and 10.5 kya but its stabilization continued until 9.3 kya. In the case of the Hungarian Plain this process took even longer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref084">84</xref>]. The <italic>K</italic> = 2 pattern on the map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168621.g004">Fig 4</xref>) seems to correspond quite well to the Vistula and Danube river valleys. The pattern observed for <italic>K</italic> = 3 has similarities to that obtained for <italic>K</italic> = 2. In that case the western group still has the same distribution while the eastern group shows a degree of subdivision. According to the conclusions presented above and our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref034">34</xref>], we assume that the pattern obtained for <italic>K</italic> = 2 may best explain the observed diversity in the common vole populations in central Europe. In either case, the pattern has become largely obscured by later gene flow, which explains the lack of structure that was recovered with the sPCA.</p>
<p>Extensive sampling allowed us to perform an in-depth analysis of genetic diversity throughout the Eastern lineage of the common vole. Results of our study suggest that this lineage expanded from the Carpathian refugium and support an assumption that the Carpathians play an important role as a biodiversity hotspot (see in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref085">85</xref>] for a recent review). Our study also supports a hypothesis that a part of central and eastern Europe (present-day Poland) does indeed form a phylogeographic suture zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref010">10</xref>]. Other species display a contact zone in Poland, for example, the bank vole, the common shrew (<italic>Sorex araneus</italic>) and the weasel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168621.ref086">86</xref>]. Phylogeographic investigations in the central and eastern parts of Europe are important to examine colonization processes, including the meeting of lineages and the relative impact of southern and northern refugia on the postglacial colonization history of Europe.</p>
