<abstract>
<p>A moderate heat shock induces <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> to synthesize large quantities of heat shock proteins that are protective against higher, otherwise lethal temperatures. However, wild type cells do not survive when carbohydrate deprivation is added to heat shock. In contrast, a mutant strain defective in a stress-activated protein kinase does survive the combined stresses. In order to understand the basis for this difference in survival, we have determined the relative levels of detected proteins in the mutant and wild type strain during dual stress, and we have identified gene transcripts in both strains whose quantities change in response to heat shock or dual stress. These data and supportive experimental evidence point to reasons for survival of the mutant strain. By using alternative respiratory mechanisms, these cells experience less of the oxidative stress that proves damaging to wild type cells. Of central importance, mutant cells recycle limited resources during dual stress by undergoing autophagy, a process that we find utilized by both wild type and mutant cells during heat shock. Evidence points to inappropriate activation of TORC1, the central metabolic regulator, in wild type cells during dual stress, based upon behavior of an additional signaling mutant and inhibitor studies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The universal response of cells to high, non-lethal temperatures is characterized by the massive, but transient synthesis of heat shock proteins (Hsps) that protect cellular proteins from denaturation, help refold them, or alternatively guide their destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref002">2</xref>]. This response is also characterized by increased reliance on glycolysis for energy generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref003">3</xref>] at the expense of mitochondrial oxidative respiration. We have asked whether cell recovery from heat shock could be compromised if glycolysis simultaneously was blocked by glucose starvation, induced by a glucose metabolism inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref004">4</xref>]. Indeed, we found that these conditions of dual stress (DS) proved lethal to wild type (wt) <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>.</p>
<p>We reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref004">4</xref>] that inhibition of fatty acid synthesis, particularly ceramide synthesis, restored survival to wt cells under DS; and we identified a novel long chain phytoceramide, made uniquely by vulnerable wt cells, that might signal cell death. In the present study we show that wt survival of DS is dramatically increased by addition of the anti-oxidant glutathione to the growth medium, implicating oxidative stress as a chief source of lethality. In support of this, our assays on intact cells demonstrate that wt has elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a result of DS, but not in response to heat shock (HS). Similarly, whole cell assays show that nitric oxide (NO) peaks in wt during DS, but not during HS.</p>
<p>Furthermore, addition of rapamycin, in this study, protected wt cells from DS-induced death. Rapamycin inhibits the Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (TORC1), which is the central driver of cell growth and anabolic metabolism under favorable conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref005">5</xref>]. TORC1 inactivation by nutritional deficiency or heat shock, an effect mimicked by rapamycin addition, typically results in the autophagic degradation and recyling of cellular components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref006">6</xref>], thereby enhancing survival under stress conditions.</p>
<p>In our earlier study of DS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref004">4</xref>], we also assayed survival of the <italic>os2</italic> mutant strain, which lacks a functional stress MAP kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref007">7</xref>]; we were prompted by reports that the p38 mammalian homolog participates in cell death signaling. The Os2 MAP kinase of <italic>N</italic>. <italic>crassa</italic>, like its homolog Hog1 in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, is activated by HS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref004">4</xref>], as well as by hyperosmotic stress; and it contributes to the heat shock response, although it is not required for HS survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref007">7</xref>]. In contrast to the extremely low survival of wt cells subjected to DS, we found that cells lacking a functional Os2 or deleted in <italic>os2</italic> survive DS well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref004">4</xref>], indicating that activation of Os2 is detrimental to cells that undergo DS. In the current report, we learned that the <italic>os2</italic> mutant strain (os2) does not show the DS-induced increase in ROS found for wt and only a small increase in NO.</p>
<p>To gain a wider understanding of changes in gene expression induced by HS and DS, we employed global assays of proteins and mRNAs present in extracts of wt and os2 cells, utilizing iTRAQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref008">8</xref>] and RNAseq protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref009">9</xref>]. We have focused our analysis on metabolic pathways and on the regulatory mechanisms utilized by wt and os2, employing a variety of experimental approaches in addition to bioinformatics. The results suggest that wt and os2 cells undergo autophagy in response to HS, but that only os2 undergoes autophagy during DS. We propose that TORC1 may be inappropriately activated in wt undergoing DS. Possible signaling pathways are examined and discussed.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>2-DG Uptake</title>
<p>We verified that wt and os2 cells under stress incorporated similar amounts of 2-DG by providing them with radiolabeled 2-DG and measuring the radioactivity associated with cell pellets and the residual radioactivity of the growth medium. This showed that the kinetics of uptake were slower in os2, so that within the first 15 min os2 cells had taken up 7% of the available labeled 2-DG and wt had taken up 37%. However, the difference in uptake diminished by 75 min, when 48% of the 2-DG had been taken up by os2 and 59% by wt. Furthermore, by utilizing liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry we performed an untargeted metabolomics analysis of wt and os2 cells at 30°C, HS, and DS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref010">10</xref>]. We learned that only the DS treatment of the two strains produced extracts with very highly increased levels of 1-<italic>O</italic>-phosphonohexitol, with a ratio of 86 for wt DS/30°C (p value of 0.0128) and a ratio of 452 for os2 DS/30°C (p value of 0.0056). This metabolite likely represents a product of accumulated phosphorylated glucose, from glycogen degradation and other sources, whose further metabolism is blocked by the 2-DG incorporated into these cells.</p>

<title>Cell Survival</title>
<p>To detect possible signaling proteins involved in susceptibility to DS, we measured the DS survival of selected deletion mutant strains, which were developed through the <italic>Neurospora</italic> Genome Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref011">11</xref>] and provided by the Fungal Genetics Stock Center [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref012">12</xref>]. We learned that the <italic>os2</italic> deletion mutant survived 80% under DS, but the os2 strain that we employed in further experiments for this study is a long-studied point mutant strain, UCLA 80, that produces a truncated non-functional protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref013">13</xref>]. This mutant strain also shows high survival in response to DS, varying between 75% and 90% of its control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165980.g001">Fig 1</xref>), whereas wt is largely killed by DS, surviving 2% to 5% of its room temperature (RT) control in petri plate assays.</p>

</fig>
<p>Most other assayed strains, mutant in signaling pathways, such as mek1, mak1, and camk4, showed a low survival similar to that of wt, but a few showed more resistance to DS. Notably, when we assayed stk10, lacking the <italic>Neurospora</italic> gene homologous to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae sch9</italic>, we found that it survived DS 50% to 70% of its control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165980.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Deletion of genes for <italic>sch9</italic> extends replicative lifespan of yeast, mimicking the effects of calorie restriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>We added compensatory or inhibitory reagents to the petri plate medium to determine whether they protected cells undergoing DS or replicated the damage of DS. The reduced tripeptide glutathione is a powerful anti-oxidant as well as a detoxifying agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref014">14</xref>]. We found that 10 mM glutathione consistently increased DS survival of wt to 75–80% of control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165980.g001">Fig 1</xref>), which is comparable to os2 survival without glutathione. 25 μM probucol, an anti-oxidant that protects lipids from peroxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref015">15</xref>], reproducibly increased wt survival from 1% to 20% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165980.g001">Fig 1</xref>), supporting the more dramatic results with reduced glutathione.</p>
<p>Because these results pointed to oxidative stress as a major contributor to wt death under DS, we added pro-oxidants to RT petri plate assays of wt and os2. The addition of hydrogen peroxide, at various concentrations, showed that os2 had a 4- to 6-fold enhanced resistance to this oxidant, compared with wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165980.g001">Fig 1</xref>). For example, 0.6 mM hydrogen peroxide resulted in wt survival of 6% and os2 survival of 33%. This resistance may not be relevant to os2 DS survival, however, since DS proved lethal to a camk4 deletion mutant that also showed greater resistance to hydrogen peroxide than wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165980.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Furthermore, addition of the pro-oxidant menadione to cell assays at RT had a contrasting outcome to hydrogen peroxide. 20 μM menadione resulted in wt survival of 70% and os2 survival of 35%, a 2-fold difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165980.g001">Fig 1</xref>); at different menadione concentrations the ratio was higher or lower, but always to the advantage of wt. This indicates that os2 does not have a greater intrinsic resistance to all forms of oxidative stress. In contrast to our findings, earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref016">16</xref>] reported that the <italic>os2</italic> mutant strain was more inhibited by hydrogen peroxide than wt, according to the rate of colony extension. However, the developmental stage and type of measurements were different from those reported here.</p>
<p>Cellular processes affected by addition of 2-DG would be expected to include cell wall deposition and protein glycosylation, in addition to energy generation. Alterations in cell wall glycans likely activate protein kinase c (Pkc) and the protective cell integrity MAP kinase cascade. In Western blots, discussed below, we found that DS increased the amount of phosphorylated Mak1 of this pathway above control levels in both wt and os2, but Mak1 appeared hyperphosphorylated in os2. To stimulate the cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway further in wt cells during DS, we added to them 40 μM dioctanoyl-glycerol, an analog of diacylglycerol that stimulates Pkc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref017">17</xref>]. Although this concentration should be in the biologically effective range, it had no effect on wt survival (data not shown). Another likely effect of 2-DG is the disturbance of sugar modifications on membrane and secreted proteins. As an analog, we added the protein glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin at 0.4 μg ml<sup>-1</sup> to wt and os2 cells during HS. We found that wt survival was 79% and that of os2 was 23% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165980.g001">Fig 1</xref>), almost a 4-fold difference; at 0.8 μg ml<sup>-1</sup> there was lower survival and a 10-fold difference between strains. Therefore, the DS survival advantage of os2 over wt does not derive from tolerance for disturbed glycosylation of proteins.</p>
<p>Rapamycin is an inhibitor of TORC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref006">6</xref>], the kinase complex that is central to cell growth and proliferation under favorable conditions. Inactivity of TORC1 under unfavorable conditions slows growth and promotes mechanisms such as autophagy that allow cell survival. Like deletion of <italic>sch9</italic> or <italic>tor1</italic>, rapamycin addition enhances life span extension in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref006">6</xref>]. We found that 2 μM rapamycin added to plate assays fully restored DS survival to wt and os2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165980.g001">Fig 1</xref>). All strains that we treated with 2 μM rapamycin during DS showed partially increased survival, including <italic>atg1</italic> and <italic>atg7</italic> deleted strains, suggesting that rapamycin may enhance survival in ways additional to autophagy. The exception to this enhanced survival was stk10/sch9, whose survival under DS declined from 50% without rapamycin to 1.3% with rapamycin. Only a lower amount of rapamycin, 0.5 μM, failed to depress stk10 survival, while still completely protecting wt during DS. These results show that TORC1 inactivation counteracts the damaging effects of DS, while they also suggest that TORC1 activity may be at least partially disabled already in the stk10 strain, requiring calibration of rapamycin to avoid excessive, damaging inhibition of TORC1.</p>
<p>The autophagy that results from TORC1 inactivity requires acidified vacuoles/lysosomes, and autophagy can be blocked by the anti-malarial drug chloroquine, which accumulates in vacuoles and alkalizes them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref018">18</xref>]. When we added 1 mM chloroquine to rapamycin-treated cells undergoing DS, survival of both wt and os2 declined from 100% to 63% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165980.g001">Fig 1</xref>), suggesting that at least one beneficial effect of rapamycin addition and TORC1 inhibition is the enhancement of autophagy. Furthermore, in the absence of rapamycin, we found that 2 mM chloroquine brought os2 DS survival from 94% to 34%, and 2.5 mM reduced stk10 survival from 46% to 18% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165980.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This indicates that autophagy is likely an important source for cellular resistance to DS in these two mutant strains.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec005">
<title>Measurement of Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species</title>
<p>The positive effect of glutathione on wt survival during DS suggests the presence of damaging reactive oxygen species and/or reactive nitrogen species in wt cells. To derive relative measurements for ROS and nitric oxide (NO) in intact cells, we employed cell-permeant, fluorescent reagents. For ROS detection, 2’,7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate was added to wt and os2 cells during a 60 min exposure to HS, DS or continued incubation at 30°C. The cells were washed, diluted to four different concentrations in buffer, and aliquoted into microplate wells. Readings were recorded from a microplate reader, normalized, and averaged for each treatment. This showed that after one hr exposure to DS, the ROS signal for wt was 58% higher than its 30°C signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165980.g002">Fig 2</xref>). In contrast, the ROS signal for os2 during DS was 20% lower than its 30°C signal, which is apparently elevated. Nevertheless, in the first hr of DS, wt has 39% higher levels of ROS than os2 has. When their ROS signals during HS are compared, wt and os2 are equivalent and similar to wt 30°C levels. These results show that ROS are not elevated during HS in either strain and that there are similar levels in wt and os2 during HS. In contrast, ROS are elevated in wt during DS both in comparison to its 30°C level and in comparison to the os2 DS level. For os2, the anti-oxidants induced by either stress treatment likely reduce ROS below their elevated 30°C levels, but the HS level is lower than the DS level.</p>

<p>To detect NO in intact cells, we added 4-amino-5-methylamino-2’,7’-difluorofluorescein diacetate during the last 30 min of a 60 min exposure to HS, DS or continued incubation at 30°C; and we utilized the same general procedures used to measure ROS. Unlike with ROS, the 30°C levels of NO were similar for the two strains, with that of os2 being only 8% higher than in wt. Furthermore, both strains showed an increase in NO as a result of DS treatment. However, the increase over 30°C levels was much greater for wt than for os2; there was a 9- to 16-fold increase for wt, with an average of 11-fold, compared with a 3- to 4-fold increase for os2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165980.g003">Fig 3</xref>). In contrast, HS led to a 10% decline from the 30°C NO signal in wt and no change for os2. These results indicate that combining 2-DG with HS produces a large increase in NO over 30°C or HS alone and that this increase is especially high for wt.</p>

<title>Bioinformatics Analysis</title>
<p>iTRAQ protein comparisons were made between wt and os2 after three hr of exposure to DS conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0165980.t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165980.s006">S3 Table</xref>). Proteomics provides a picture of the detected proteins present in cells, as well as the ratio between mutant and wt strains for particular proteins. We also employed RNAseq to compare transcripts in wt and os2 cultures exposed to three conditions: 30°C control, two hr of HS, or two hr of DS (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165980.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165980.g005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165980.s004">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165980.s005">S2</xref> Tables). RNAseq yields approximate quantities of transcripts, as well as transcript ratios between different treatments. Given the variables of transcript stability and translational efficiency, however, it is not as directly related to cellular function as proteomics. The proteins and transcripts detected in cells subjected to DS may derive either from the single stresses of heat shock or glucose-deprivation or from the combined stresses.</p>

<title>Stress Proteins: Bioinformatics</title>
<p>At the transcriptional level the heat shock response of wt is stronger than that of the <italic>os2</italic> signaling mutant, with stress-specific transcripts being induced to higher levels in wt and normal transcripts being dramatically reduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165980.s004">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165980.s005">S2</xref> Tables). The greatist increase is seen for Hsp30 transcripts, which are elevated 187-fold in wt and 64-fold in os2 over control levels. When carbohydrate deficiency is added to heat stress, both wt and os2 increase their stress-specific transcripts, with wt achieving very high levels. This DS-induced increase in Hsp30 transcripts is 1,376-fold in wt and 557-fold in os2. It is notable, however, that normal transcripts appear relatively stable in wt under DS, with only moderate reductions for some and small increases for others. In contrast, os2 displays larger transcript decreases during DS than it does during HS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165980.s005">S2 Table</xref>). This suggests that os2 may perceive DS as an enhanced stress, and wt may perceive HS and nutritional deprivation as conflicting stresses. There is also the unexplored possibility that 2-DG or the accumulated hexose metabolite is perceived as a high glucose signal by wt, but not by os2.</p>
<p>Proteomics analysis, which provides a ratio between DS-treated os2 and wt (os2/wt) for detected proteins, shows that at three hr os2 is higher in all the major Hsps (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0165980.t001">Table 1</xref>). This is in strong contrast to Hsp transcript levels at two hr of DS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165980.s004">S1 Table</xref>). These proteins include Hsp30 (1.57), Hsp90 (1.52), Hsp70 (1.32), Hsp88 (1.20), and the J-proteins Ydj1 (1.14) and Sis1 (1.13). os2 is also higher in the Hsp70 nucleotide exchange factor, Fes1 (1.11*), and in the Hsp90 co-chaperones p23 (1.37*) and Sti1 (1.32). The organellar Hsps (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0165980.t001">Table 1</xref>) and cytosolic cyclophilin-40 (1.42) are also increased in os2, but the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized immunophilins are decreased in os2 relative to wt. Nevertheless, the lower abundance of major Hsps in wt than in os2 during DS suggests that wt transcripts may become unstable, their translation may be impaired, or extensive proteolysis may be occurring in wt. We believe that the wt translational apparatus may become unregulated by DS, since wt transcripts for ribosomal and ribosomal processing proteins are relatively stable during DS, in contrast to their strong reduction during HS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165980.s005">S2 Table</xref>). These transcripts in os2 are depressed similarly during HS and DS.</p>

<title>Glycolysis</title>
<p>In response to high temperature, carbohydrate metabolism changes from a focus on oxidative respiration to an increase in glycolysis and fermentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref003">3</xref>]. However, addition of an inhibitor of glycolysis, such as 2-DG, would be expected to shift the balance from intense glycolysis to increased oxidative respiration. Stage-specific differences between the two strains in their use of glycolysis during DS are suggested by proteomics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0165980.t001">Table 1</xref>). os2 is moderately high in pyruvate kinase (1.12) and enolase (1.08) of the later ATP-generating phase of glycolysis, but it is moderately low in enzymes of the initial ATP-utilizing phase, a hexokinase variant (0.91), triosephosphate isomerase (0.88) and glucose 6-phosphate isomerase (0.88).</p>

Proteomics analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165980.s006">S3 Table</xref>) indicates that os2 is higher than wt during DS in four enzymes of ethanol fermentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref019">19</xref>], but it is lower than wt in the major fermenting alcohol dehydrogenase I (0.87).</p>

<sec id="sec011">
<title>Gluconeogenesis</title>
<p>Stress leads to increased transcripts for PEP carboxykinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165980.g004">Fig 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165980.s004">S1 Table</xref>), which are elevated 3.3-fold in each strain during DS. Proteomics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0165980.t001">Table 1</xref>) show that os2 has higher amounts than wt of this enzyme (1.24), which catalyzes the rate limiting step in gluconeogenesis, suggesting that os2 is more active in gluconeogenesis than wt during DS.</p>

<sec id="sec012">
<title>Pentose Phosphate Pathway</title>
<p>The pentose phosphate pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref020">20</xref>], running parallel to glycolysis, generates 5-carbon sugars and NADPH for molecular biosyntheses and reducing agents. By proteomics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0165980.t001">Table 1</xref>), os2 is low in several enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway, including transaldolase (0.88), transketolase (0.85), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (0.82), and ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase (0.77). Transcripts for transaldolase decrease in os2 during stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165980.s005">S2 Table</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec013">
<title>TCA Cycle</title>
<p>Proteomics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0165980.t001">Table 1</xref>) suggest that os2 is more active than wt in the TCA cycle during DS, since os2 is moderately higher in two TCA enzymes, a succinyl-CoA ligase subunit (1.09) and a pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component (1.10*). Furthermore, the lipoyltransferase that is essential for modifying and activating many oxidative ezymes, notably TCA cycle pyruvate dehydrogenase, is upregulated in os2 over wt (1.25<sup>§</sup>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec014">
<title>Ketone Bodies</title>
<p>High levels of acetyl-CoA, resulting from catabolism, can accumulate in mitochondria when its entry into the TCA cycle is blocked by a shortage of oxaloacetate. This leads to the formation of ketone bodies such as acetoacetate, which can later be catabolized back to acetyl-CoA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref021">21</xref>]. Proteomics analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0165980.t001">Table 1</xref>) shows that os2 is higher than wt in multiple enzymes involved in ketone body formation and dissolution, including hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA lyase (1.16*), a succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA-transferase subunit (1.35*), and 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (1.16*). Transcripts for hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA lyase accumulate to 3.4-fold higher levels in os2 during both HS and DS, compared with 30°C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165980.s004">S1 Table</xref>).</p>

Proteomics analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165980.s006">S3 Table</xref>) shows that os2 has higher amounts of glycogen phosphorylase (1.15) and glycogen debranching enzyme (1.14), as well as the starch degrading enzyme α-amylase (1.37).</p>

<title>Energy-Yielding Electron Transport</title>
<p>Although mitochondrial oxidative respiration is the most efficient way to generate energy from limited glucose resources, it can also be a source of damaging ROS when electron flow is inhibited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref022">22</xref>]. During HS both strains, especially wt, have depressed levels of transcripts for electron transport chain components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165980.g004">Fig 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165980.s005">S2 Table</xref>). In contrast, under DS wt transcripts for subunits of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase, the cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> complex, and ATP synthase are stable or even increased over control levels. Cytochrome <italic>c</italic> mRNA is especially dramatic, declining in wt 16.7-fold in response to HS, but increasing approximately 2-fold from control during DS. Levels of these transcripts are approximately 3.5-fold lower in os2 compared with wt. Despite higher levels of transcripts in wt for respiratory enzymes, proteomics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0165980.t001">Table 1</xref>) show that os2 is higher than wt in subunits of NADH dehydrogenase (1.62 and 1.35), cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase (1.24, 1.23, 1.22*, and 1.12*), and cytochrome <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub> of the <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> complex (1.23). os2 is also higher in assembly proteins for respiratory complexes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0165980.t001">Table 1</xref>), including Coa1 (2.03) and Rcf2 (1.62*) for cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase and Cbp4 (1.33*) and Fmp25 (1.55) for Cyt <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>.</p>

<title>Alternative Oxidoreductases</title>
<p>Mitochondrial electron transport may be maintained by cells during stressful or inhibitory conditions, even without ATP synthesis, to minimize formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (22). One mechanism is to utilize alternative oxidoreductases that transfer electrons without generating ATP. Alternative oxidases (Aods) transfer electrons from ubiquinone directly to oxygen without yielding energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref023">23</xref>].

<p>Proteomics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0165980.t001">Table 1</xref>) show that the major anti-oxidant proteins are higher in wt than in os2 during DS, with a few exceptions. wt is higher in catalase-1 (0.82), -3 (0.75*), and -4 (0.56); and it has higher amounts of many thiol-related proteins, such as glutathione reductase (0.82), thioredoxin 2 (0.76), a thioredoxin domain-containing protein (0.82) and mitochondrial glutaredoxin 5 (0.84<sup>§</sup>). On the other hand, os2 has higher amounts of catalase 2 (1.52), a mitochondrial (Fe/Mn) SOD (1.37*), a copper chaperone for cytoplasmic (Cu/Zn) SOD (1.21<sup>§</sup>), and the Mig4 (1.36) and Mig5 (1.25) reductases.</p>

Catalase 1 mRNA increases 40-fold in wt during HS and 12-fold during DS, but only 3.7-fold in os2 during DS; it is a gene whose full induction by stress is reported to depend on Os2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref007">7</xref>].</p>

<title>Autophagy and Vacuoles: Bioinformatics</title>
<p>Macro-autophagy (also referred to as autophagy) involves the vacuolar degradation and recycling of cellular constituents for cell maintenance and growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref030">30</xref>]. Since autophagy frequently functions as a protective response to starvation and other stresses, it might enhance resistance to DS, a proposal supported by experimental results presented above. Proteomics show that several vacuolar proteases are upregulated in os2 compared with wt (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0165980.t001">Table 1</xref>). The highest in os2 is a subtilisin-like serine protease (1.53), whose vacuolar Prb1 homolog is induced in yeast by starvation and sporulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref031">31</xref>]. Three other vacuolar proteases that are elevated in os2 are Lap4 (1.15), carboxypeptidase s (1.39*), and Pep4 (1.15*), which processes and activates other vacuolar proteins. os2 also has higher content of the vacuolar sorting protein Vps17 (1.16<sup>§</sup>) and the vacuolar pH-sensitive ATPase (1.10*). Two proteins with peptidase inhibitor domains (0.81 and 0.68) are reduced in os2. Transcripts for several vacuolar sorting and transport proteins are also uniquely elevated in os2 during DS, including mRNAs for vacuolar sorting receptors, vacuolar amino acid transporter 1, and oligopeptide transporter 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165980.s004">S1 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>Many autophagy-related proteins participate in the formation of autophagosomes that deliver proteins and other cellular constituents to the vacuoles/lysosomes for degradation. Compared to wt, os2 is enriched in the E2-like autophagy protein Atg3 (1.14<sup>§</sup>), involved in protein lipidation and phagophore expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref032">32</xref>] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0165980.t001">Table 1</xref>).

<title>Ubiquitin and Proteasomes: Bioinformatics</title>
<p>Ubiquitin-modification can mark proteins for proteolysis by the 26S proteasome, which is responsible for non-vacuolar degradation of denatured, damaged, or short-lived proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref033">33</xref>]. Most ubiquitin-related transcripts are particularly elevated during DS, compared with HS, in both wt and os2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165980.s004">S1 Table</xref>). These DS-induced transcripts encode polyubiquitin, a ubiquitin ligase, a 26 S proteasomal subunit, a RING-10 ubiquitin hydrolase, and two ubiquitin fusion degradation proteins. According to proteomics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0165980.t001">Table 1</xref>), os2 is higher than wt in a few ubiquitin/proteasome-associated proteins that include the Pre5α-6 proteasomal subunit (1.17<sup>§</sup>); Dph-1 (1.29), an ubiquitin-binding protein that protects against de-ubiquitination; and an ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (1.12) that de-ubiquitinates proteins.

<title>Programmed Cell Death: Bioinformatics</title>
<p>Apoptosis or programmed cell death (PCD) typically involves a cascade of proteolytic caspases that effect changes in membranes, chromatin, and overall cell morphology, ultimately leading to self-destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref034">34</xref>].

<p>The DS-induced death of wt depends upon ROS, which are an important hallmark of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref024">24</xref>]. Certain reductases and dehydrogenases in <italic>Neurospora</italic> have been identified as cell death-associated, being either pro- or anti-apoptotic. According to this identification, wt has higher amounts of pro-apoptotic proteins and os2 has higher amounts of anti-apoptotic proteins during DS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0165980.t001">Table 1</xref>). The pro-apoptotic proteins include a NADPH-quinone oxidoreductase (0.77), similar to PIG3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref037">37</xref>], and rubredoxin-NAD+ reductase/AIF (0.59), whose gene deletion was reported to protect <italic>Neurospora</italic> cells from phytosphingosine-induced death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref024">24</xref>]. On the other hand, os2 has higher amounts of a protective cytoplasmic NADH-dehydrogenase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref024">24</xref>], identified as AMID (1.43*), and higher amounts of Oye2/Mig3 (1.09), an NADPH-dependent dehydrogenase, whose overexpression increased yeast resistance to apoptotic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref038">38</xref>]. This imbalance of putative pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins favors the susceptibility of wt to PCD and the resistance of os2.</p>

Both stresses lead to increased mRNA for calcium-transporting ATPase 3 mRNA in os2 and wt (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165980.s004">S1 Table</xref>). Proteomics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0165980.t001">Table 1</xref>) show that ATPase 3 (1.60) and a closely related ATPase (1.21) are elevated in os2.

Western blots showed that phosphorylation of eIF2α occurs in wt, os2, and stk10 in response to DS, and eIF2α remains phosphorylated for at least two hr of DS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165980.g007">Fig 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165980.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). This similarity of the two mutant strains to wt suggests that Os2 and Stk10 do not influence this activation step in cross-pathway control, despite bioinformatics data sugesting that this pathway is depressed in wt, relative to os2, during DS.</p>

<p>We found that phosphorylation of Mak1, the putative CWI MAP kinase, increased in both wt and os2, as well as other tested mutant strains, subjected to DS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165980.g008">Fig 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165980.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).

<title>Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
<p>Gene expression and protein data suggest that autophagy is a prominent feature of the response of os2 to DS, and cell survival studies lend support to the cell protective effect of autophagy. To learn more directly whether autophagy likely is occurring in os2 cells during DS, we prepared cells of both strains exposed to control, HS, or DS conditions. We examined thin sections of these cells by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which has been effectively employed to visualize electron dense autophagic bodies in fungal vacuoles/lysosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref060">60</xref>].</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165980.g009">Fig 9</xref>, vacuoles of os2 cells subjected to DS are filled with what appear to be autophagic bodies. Similar autophagic vesicles fill the vacuoles of os2 and wt cells subjected to HS. However, such vacuoles are uncommon in wt during DS, and they contain fewer vesicles. Instead, there are large dark bodies in many of the wt vacuoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165980.g009">Fig 9</xref>), which may be a normal feature of <italic>Neurospora</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref061">61</xref>] and seemingly unrelated to autophagy. In wt cells incubated only at 30°C there are similar large, dark bodies evident in the vacuoles, along with vacuoles containing sparse vesicles. In fact, the DS and control vacuoles of wt look very similar to each other. os2 cells that have been exposed only to 30°C have emptier vacuoles than they do during HS or DS, and any vesicular material within them appears diffuse. These micrographs provide evidence that autophagy is likely a prominent feature of the heat shock response of both <italic>Neurospora</italic> strains and that it also characterizes the response of os2 to DS, but autophagy is not characteristic of the wt DS response, where vacuoles appear unchanged from 30°C. Autophagy, therefore, appears to be a feature of the protective heat shock response that is compromised in wt by DS.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We found that the combination of heat stress and nutritional deprivation, induced by a non-metabolizable glucose analog, was lethal to wt cells, while it was well tolerated by a mutant strain lacking a functional stress signaling kinase. Bioinformatic approaches increased our understanding of how the lethal response of wt to DS differs from its protective HS response, and how the <italic>os2</italic> mutant strain differs in its DS response from wt. We have also employed a variety of experimental approaches that reveal many differences between the two strains, some of which likely are relevant to the question of lethality or survival. The question itself is perplexing, since the stress MAP kinase that is nonfunctional in the mutant strain is normally activated by stress and, although non-essential, contributes to a strong HS response (this study, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref007">7</xref>]) and would be expected to be beneficial in wt cells.</p>
<p>What seems clear is that the HS response of wt is stronger than that of the <italic>os2</italic> signaling mutant, both in the stress-specific transcripts that are induced to higher levels and in the normal transcripts that are dramatically reduced in wt. When carbohydrate deficiency is added to heat stress, both wt and os2 increase their stress-specific transcripts, with wt achieving very high levels. However, wt deviates from the typical HS pattern in that normal transcripts are only moderately reduced or not reduced at all from 30°C control levels. This inconsistency in wt suggests that it may be invoking two different response patterns to the combined stresses and that these responses conflict. Alternatively, its positive stress response may be so intense under DS that it is unable to respond appropriately to other signals. Despite its strikingly higher amounts of Hsp transcripts, wt accumulates lower amounts of Hsps during DS in comparison to os2. Future experiments may show whether the extremely high mRNA levels of wt for both stress-induced proteins and normal proteins are due to a lack of RNA degradation and whether the low levels of corresponding proteins are due to inefficient translation of these mRNAs or to extensive proteolysis.</p>
<p>Carbohydrate metabolism is altered at the transcript level by both HS and DS, which lead to increased transcripts for enzymes involved in fermentation, an important means for generating energy under stress conditions when oxidative respiration is minimized. In the glycolytic pathway, os2 is higher in enzymes of the ATP-producing stages of the pathway and wt is higher in enzymes of the ATP-utilizing stages. Transcripts for gluconeogenic enzymes increase during stress, and os2 is higher in the rate-limiting enzyme PEP carboxykinase. Overall, os2 appears to be more active in gluconeogenesis and in catabolism for generating glucose and TCA intermediates during DS, as evidenced by its enrichment in enzymes of glycogen degradation and ketone body metabolism. wt, on the other hand, is likely more active in anabolic metabolism, including the pentose phosphate pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref020">20</xref>], which produces ribose sugars for nucleotides and NADPH for biosynthetic pathways. Subunits of mitochondrial respiratory complexes and their assembly proteins are more abundant in os2 during DS, despite higher wt transcripts for these subunits. Furthermore, proteins that guide mitochondrial fission and morphology are upregulated in os2 over wt during DS, implying greater dynamism in mitochondria of the mutant strain.</p>
<p>ROS are implicated in the lethality of DS, since addition of the anti-oxidant glutathione rescues wt cells from death. In fact, we found that DS, but not HS, leads to increased ROS and very high NO in intact wt cells. In contrast, DS does not lead to increased ROS in os2 and the resultant NO levels are only moderately high. Nevertheless, intrinsic anti-oxidant capabilities do not appear sufficient to explain these differences between wt and os2, since most catalases and thiol-related anti-oxidant proteins are lower in os2 than in wt. Furthermore, according to our recent LC-MS metabolomics analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref010">10</xref>], glutathione content increased 5-fold (p value of 0.00638) in wt cells subjected to DS. Intracellular ROS are a by-product of oxidative respiration under normal conditions, and mitochondrial ROS increase further when the electron transport chain is inhibited by stress or mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref023">23</xref>]. The low level of ROS in os2 may be due, at least in part, to its DS-induced increase in alternative mitochondrial electron carriers that circumvent the respiratory complexes where ROS are primarily generated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>Many vacuolar/lysosomal proteases are more abundant in os2 during DS than in wt, leading us to believe that autophagy may be an important factor in os2 survival, a proposal supported by further experiments. Our analysis also shows that many transcripts for proteins involved in autophagosome formation and vacuolar biogenesis are upregulated by HS, but only in os2 are they induced to higher levels by DS. Both strains have increased transcripts related to protein ubiquitination and proteasome biogenesis during DS. Transcripts associated with programmed cell death also increase to higher levels during DS than during HS. wt proved to have higher quantities of oxidoreductases that are reported to be pro-apoptotic, whereas os2 had higher quantities of anti-apoptotic oxidoreductases. This balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins supports the possibility, proposed by us earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref004">4</xref>], that apoptosis or PCD may be responsible for the DS-induced death of wt.</p>
<p>Although DS leads to activation of MAP kinases in two stress pathways, these pathways show divergent transcriptional responses. Transcripts for the osmotic stress pathway are stable or increase during stress, whereas transcripts for the CWI pathway are downregulated by stress, except for wt during DS. Detected CWI pathway proteins are also higher in wt than in os2 during DS. Nevertheless, more phosphorylated Mak1 of this pathway is evident in os2. Perhaps downregulation of CWI transcripts and proteins in os2 is a feedback mechanism to dampen their hyperactivation during DS. The general amino acid control pathway is upregulated by DS. Transcripts for Cpc2, which is a transcriptional repressor of this pathway, decline during all stress conditions, but remain stable during DS in wt, which also has higher quantities of Cpc2. In parallel, transcripts for eIF2α kinase (Cpc3) increase during stress in os2 to higher levels than in wt, suggesting that cross-pathway control is less effective in wt during DS than in os2. Nevertheless, phosphorylation of eIF2α appeared to occur equally in wt and os2 during the initial stages of DS.</p>
<p>Our survival assays of strains deleted in genes for signaling proteins showed that the <italic>stk10</italic> mutant strain survives almost as well as os2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165980.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The yeast homolog of Stk10, Sch9, is directly phosphorylated by activated Tor1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref062">62</xref>]. When we inhibited TORC1 with rapamycin, we found that wt cells were rescued from DS-induced death and survival of os2 and other assayed mutant strains was enhanced. In contrast, rapamycin decreased the strong resistance of stk10 to DS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165980.g001">Fig 1</xref>), likely due to pre-existing ineffectiveness of TORC1 in the stk10 strain. We learned that Stk10 is required for phosphorylation of Os2 in response to DS; and like Os2, it is required for resistance to hyperosmotic stress, as confirmed by us (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165980.g001">Fig 1</xref>) and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref063">63</xref>]. Furthermore, yeast Sch9, which also is required for hyperosmotic stress resistance, was found to associate with Hog1 during osmotic stress; but it did not directly phosphorylate it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref064">64</xref>]. However, in a recent report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref065">65</xref>], deletion of <italic>sch9</italic> abolished the Hog1 phosphorylation that was induced by C2-ceramide treatment in Isc1-deficient yeast cells.</p>
<p>Our observations suggest that the DS-induced phosphorylation of Os2 may depend indirectly upon activated TORC1, as well as on Stk10. We earlier reported that Os2 activation appeared greater during DS than during HS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref004">4</xref>], and we found here that rapamycin addition during DS depressed Os2 phosphorylation in wt. Overall, these results suggest that TORC1 may remain at least partially activated in wt during DS; and being activated, it may phosphorylate Stk10, which is needed for the subsequent phosphorylation of Os2. Nevertheless, much of the damaging effect of the proposed TORC1 activation can evidently be communicated through the activation of Os2 during DS. It has been reported that the p38 MAP kinase of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is necessary for activation of TORC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref066">66</xref>], and there may be a positive feedback loop in <italic>Neurospora</italic> between Os2 and TORC1. Further experiments are needed to directly address the relationship between TORC1 and Os2 during DS.</p>
<p>Earlier reports have shown that autophagy is required for the lifespan extension that is produced by <italic>tor1</italic> or <italic>sch9</italic> mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref006">6</xref>]. According to our visualization of vacuoles by TEM, autophagy appears to be a prominent feature of the HS response of wt and os2. However, during DS it remains important only for os2 and appears absent in wt. The mammalian p38 MAP kinase has been reported to have contradictory effects on autophagy, either facilitating it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref067">67</xref>] or inhibiting it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref068">68</xref>], depending on context. This may apply to Os2, as well, since its activation during HS clearly does not interfere with autophagy. However, more highly activated Os2 during DS appears to inhibit autophagy. In contrast, the <italic>os2</italic> mutant strain, which is able to undergo autophagy, tolerates DS well. It is likely that wt cells, characterized by high levels of ROS, undergo apoptosis or PCD, a possibility that needs to be explored further.</p>
<p>A contributing liability for wt may be its increased anabolic activity, possibly driven by TORC1; this is indicated by its relative abundance of pentose phosphate pathway enzymes and greater quantities of enzymes that assimilate sulfur and nitrogen into metaboIites such as methionine and ammonia, respectively. Furthermore, bioinformatics suggest that the biosynthesis of lipids is higher in wt during DS than in os2. In our earlier study of DS, we found that fatty acid synthesis was necessary for wt death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref004">4</xref>]. Blocking this synthesis either chemically or genetically allowed cells to fully survive DS. The anabolic activity of wt would be appropriate under growth conditions when resources are abundant, but it is inappropriate under stress. os2, on the other hand, likely utilizes fatty acid catabolism under DS in part to generate substrates for mitochondrial respiration, as judged by its increased content of enzymes for ketone body metabolism. os2 also has a higher complement of mitochondrial proteins involved directly in electron transport, including those that minimize the generation of ROS.</p>
<p>In this report we have sought to understand the basis for DS lethality to wt cells. In summary, we found that DS causes wt cells to diverge from the characteristics of its protective HS response. The DS response of wt deviates in its stabilization or new synthesis of normal mRNAs, increased ROS and NO, likely increased anabolic activity, and lack of autophagy. The DS response of os2 cells, in contrast, more closely resembles its HS response.</p>

The plates were incubated for 44 hr at 45°C, and the colonies growing from surviving spores were counted. A minimum of three plates was used for each treatment. Additions to the liquified agar medium, for individual experiments, included reduced L-glutathione, probucol, menadione, chloroquine, tunicamycin (all from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis), hydrogen peroxide (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh), rapamycin (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA), and 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI).</p>

<title>ROS measurement</title>
<p>Ten μM 2’,7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) in ethanol were added to 10 ml cultures at time of stress and to the 30°C control. Cells were collected after 1 hr, washed with 1/10 PBS, pH 7.2, resuspended in 1 ml PBS, diluted (1:0.5, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:5) with buffer, and pipetted into microplates. Procedures were performed with minimal light exposure. The fluorescence signal was read from above by a Biotek Synergy MX (Winooski, VT) scanning microplate fluorometer, with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 502 nm and 523 nm, respectively. We programmed an endpoint read at normal speed with automatic sensitivity adjustment. Gen5 software was employed for operations and data analysis.</p>

<p>Conidia were cultured as for ROS measurements. After their transfer to treatment conditions, 4-amino-5-methylamino-2’,7’-difluorofluorescein diacetate (DAF-FM diacetate, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) in DMSO was added to 1.8 μM final concentration during the last 30 min of a 60 min incubation. The cells were collected, treated, and diluted as for the ROS measurements. For fluorescence scanning, the excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 495 nm and 515 nm, respectively.</p>

<title>Western Blots</title>
<p>Protein extraction, gel electrophoresis, and Western blotting procedures were carried out as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref004">4</xref>]. Primary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), along with their concentrations, were phospho-p38 MAPK antibody, #9211 (1:1,000); phospho-p44/42 MAPK mAb, #4370 (1:2,000 or 1:3,000); and phospho-eIF2α mAb, #3398 (1:1,000). The secondary antibody (1:20,000) was peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA).</p>

<title>Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
<p><italic>Neurospora</italic> cultures, transferred from 30°C, were subjected to HS or DS for 2 hr, and the control remained at 30°C for an hr after transfer. To stabilize autophagic vesicles from proteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref060">60</xref>], 2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was added from a 100 mM ethanolic stock solution during the last hr of incubation. Cultures were filtered, washed with 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and resuspended in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Fixation was initiated by exposure of the resuspended cells to vacuum for 15 min at RT and continued overnight with constant mixing at 4°C. Samples were rinsed 3x in 0.1 M phosphate buffer and placed in 1% osmium tetroxide, 0.1 M phosphate buffer overnight at 4°C. Specimens were rinsed in water and embedded in 2% low melting point agarose (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The samples were cut into 1-mm<sup>3</sup> pieces and dehydrated in an ethanol series (2x15 min in 25%, 50%, 75%, 95%, and 3x15 min in 100%). Following dehydration the samples were infiltrated with Embed 812 resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA), with the following concentrations: 50% ethanol:50%resin, 100% resin without accelerator, and 100% resin with accelerator (2x), for a duration of 8 hr to overnight at RT for each mix. Specimens were polymerized at 60°C for 48 hr. Ultrathin sections 80–100 nm thick were cut on a Leica Ultracut UCT microtome with a diamond knife and collected on formvar/carbon-coated 200-mesh copper grids. Sections were post-stained with 3% uranyl acetate for 20 min, followed by Sato’s triple-lead stain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165980.ref075">75</xref>] for 3 min, and examined with an FEI/Philips (Hillsboro OR) CM12 transmission electron microscope operating at 60 kV. Images were recorded with a Maxim DL digital capture system.</p>
