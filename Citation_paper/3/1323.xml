        <p>Graph-based computational network analysis has proven a powerful tool to quantitatively characterize functional architectures of the brain. However, the test-retest (TRT) reliability of graph metrics of functional networks has not been systematically examined. Here, we investigated TRT reliability of topological metrics of functional brain networks derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Specifically, we evaluated both short-term (&lt;1 hour apart) and long-term (&gt;5 months apart) TRT reliability for 12 global and 6 local nodal network metrics. We found that reliability of global network metrics was overall low, threshold-sensitive and dependent on several factors of scanning time interval (TI, long-term&gt;short-term), network membership (NM, networks excluding negative correlations&gt;networks including negative correlations) and network type (NT, binarized networks&gt;weighted networks). The dependence was modulated by another factor of node definition (ND) strategy. The local nodal reliability exhibited large variability across nodal metrics and a spatially heterogeneous distribution. Nodal degree was the most reliable metric and varied the least across the factors above. Hub regions in association and limbic/paralimbic cortices showed moderate TRT reliability. Importantly, nodal reliability was robust to above-mentioned four factors. Simulation analysis revealed that global network metrics were extremely sensitive (but varying degrees) to noise in functional connectivity and weighted networks generated numerically more reliable results in compared with binarized networks. For nodal network metrics, they showed high resistance to noise in functional connectivity and no NT related differences were found in the resistance. These findings provide important implications on how to choose reliable analytical schemes and network metrics of interest.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The human brain is a highly complex system represented as a structurally interconnected network by a dense of cortico-cortical axonal pathways (i.e., structural connectome, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Sporns1">[1]</xref>) and a functionally synchronized network by external or intrinsic coherent neural activity (i.e., functional connectome, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Biswal1">[2]</xref>). Mapping the brain connectome and highlighting the underlying organizational principles are fundamental for our understanding of the brain architecture. Recent studies have manifested that human brain connectome networks can be constructed using neuroimaging (e.g., functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)) or electrophysiological (e.g., electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG)) data and further investigated by graph theoretical approaches. These brain networks have consistently demonstrated many non-trivial topological properties, such as small-worldness, modularity and highly connected hubs (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Bullmore1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-He1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Guye1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Stam1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Bullmore2">[7]</xref>), and exhibited distinct alterations associated with different neurocognitive disorders (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-He2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Bassett1">[9]</xref>).</p>
      <p>While graph theoretical approaches provide valuable insights into normal brain architecture and pathological mechanism for brain disorders, the test-retest reliability has not been systematically investigated. Reliable measures are fundamental to infer trustworthy conclusions and to serve as potential clinical biomarkers. In response to the demand, several groups examined the TRT reliability/reproducibility of graph network metrics. In anatomical world, Vaessen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Vaessen1">[10]</xref> assessed the reproducibility of anatomical brain networks derived from DTI data and reported high inter-scan reproducibility of network metrics across sampling schemes (e.g., number of gradient directions and gradient amplitude). Bassett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Bassett2">[11]</xref> demonstrated high reproducibility and low variability of graph metrics for both DTI and diffusion spectrum imaging data derived networks. As for functional imaging arena, Deuker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Deuker1">[12]</xref> investigated the TRT reliability of functional brain networks using MEG data and reported high reliability during a working memory task but relatively low under resting condition for network metrics. More recently, Telesford et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Telesford1">[13]</xref> constructed functional brain networks using baseline fMRI data during an executive task and demonstrated excellent reproducibility for both small-world properties and network efficiency metrics. Despite these progresses, however, the TRT reliability of network metrics derived from resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) dataset has not been well documented so far.</p>
      <p>R‚ÄìfMRI is a promising tool to non-invasively map intrinsic functional connectivity patterns of the human brain in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Biswal1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Biswal2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Fox1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Zhang1">[16]</xref> and has been extensively used to investigate inherent brain network topological organization (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Wang1">[17]</xref>). Of note, several previous R-fMRI studies suggest that the strength of interregional functional connectivity is dynamic in time (from seconds to minutes) and frequency domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Chang1">[18]</xref> and can be modulated by the levels of current conscious awareness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Greicius1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Horovitz1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Horovitz2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Martuzzi1">[22]</xref>, emotional state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Harrison1">[23]</xref> and cognitive demand prior to resting-state scanning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Waites1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Albert1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Lewis1">[26]</xref>. Using R-fMRI, Shehzad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Shehzad1">[27]</xref> have demonstrated modest to good TRT reliability for some specific functional connections. However, these states or experiments related alterations in functional connectivity may further interact with the global network topology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Spoormaker1">[28]</xref>. To our best knowledge, there are no studies to systematically examine the TRT reliability of network topological metrics derived from R-fMRI data. Accordingly, systematic and direct work is clearly warranted.</p>
      <p>In the current study, we implemented a comprehensive estimation of TRT reliability for both global network properties and regional nodal characteristics of intrinsic functional brain networks constructed using a public TRT R-fMRI dataset (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nitrc.org/projects/trt" xlink:type="simple">http://www.nitrc.org/projects/trt</ext-link>). This dataset allows us to examine both short-term (&lt;1 hour apart) and long-term (&gt;5 months apart) network reliability. Moreover, given numerous discrepancies in the analytical strategies of existing brain network studies (e.g., how to define network nodes or how to deal with negative correlations/connections), we further evaluated the effects of three factors on network reliability. They are: (1) network node definition (ND, i.e, structural regions of interest (ROIs) based node definition or functional ROIs based node definition); (2) network membership (NM, i.e., inclusion or exclusion negative correlations); and (3) network type (NT, i.e., binarized or weighted networks). <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0021976-t001">Table 1</xref> lists those acronyms specific to the current study.</p>

        <title>Data acquisition</title>
        <p>Three resting-state scans were obtained for each participant using a Siemens Allegra 3.0-Tesla scanner. Each scan consisted of 197 contiguous EPI functional volumes (time repetition (TR)‚Ää=‚Ää2000 ms; time echo (TE)‚Ää=‚Ää25 ms; flip angle (FA)‚Ää=‚Ää90¬∞, number of slices‚Ää=‚Ää39, matrix‚Ää=‚Ää64√ó64; field of view (FOV)‚Ää=‚Ää192 mm; acquisition voxel size‚Ää=‚Ää3√ó3√ó3 mm<sup>3</sup>). Scans 2 and 3 were conducted in a single-scan session, 45 minutes apart, and were 5‚Äì16 months (mean 11¬±4) after scan 1. All individuals were asked to relax and remain still with eyes open during the scan. Additionally, a high-resolution T1-weighted magnetization prepared gradient echo sequence was also obtained (MPRAGE, TR‚Ää=‚Ää2500 ms; TE‚Ää=‚Ää4.35 ms; inversion time‚Ää=‚Ää900 ms; FA‚Ää=‚Ää8¬∞; number of slices‚Ää=‚Ää176; FOV‚Ää=‚Ää256 mm).</p>

        <p>Data preprocessing was performed using SPM5 package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm" xlink:type="simple">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm</ext-link>). First, all images were corrected for intra-volume acquisition time offsets between slices using the Sinc interpolation and inter-volume geometrical displacement due to head movement using six-parameter (rigid body) transformation. Then all functional images were normalized into the Montreal Neurological Institute space using an optimum 12-parameter affine transformation and nonlinear deformations, and then resampled to 3-mm isotropic voxels. Finally, the normalized images were further temporally band-pass filtered (0.01‚Äì0.1 Hz) to reduce the effects of low-frequency drift and high-frequency physiological noise. Notably, for the extraction of mean nodal time courses of functional defined ROIs, spatial smoothing with 6-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel was performed before band-pass filtering (see below for node definition).</p>

          <title>Node definition (ND)</title>
          <p>A network (i.e., graph) is comprised of nodes and edges connecting nodes. In the current study, nodes represent ROIs and edges represent RSFC between ROIs. Given the accumulating evidence of effects of node definition on network topology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Wang2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Hayasaka1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Zalesky1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Fornito1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-SanabriaDiaz1">[36]</xref>, two strategies of defining ROIs (i.e., anatomical and functional ROIs) were employed to provide a comprehensive assessment of TRT reliability of brain networks across different node definitions. Specifically, to obtain structurally defined ROIs, a prior Anatomical Automatic Labeling atlas (AAL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-TzourioMazoyer1">[37]</xref> and Harvard-Oxford atlas (HOA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Kennedy1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Makris1">[39]</xref> were separately used to divide the whole brain into different number of regions. These two structural atlases parcellated the whole brain into 45 and 56 regions in each hemisphere and were termed as S-AAL and S-HOA, respectively. To obtain functionally defined ROIs, 160 spheres (radius‚Ää=‚Ää5 mm) were generated around the peak coordinates previously identified form meta-analytic studies of multiple brain functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Dosenbach1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Dosenbach2">[41]</xref> and were termed as F-DOS. These ROIs are comprised of discrete spherical ROIs and not completely cover the cerebral cortex and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021976.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). All the ROIs are associated with five different kinds of functions of error-processing, default-mode, memory, language and sensorimotor. There were no any overlaps between ROIs. Names of the three sets of ROIs and their corresponding abbreviations are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021976.s011">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021976.s012">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021976.s013">S3</xref>.</p>

          <p>To measure inter-ROI RSFC, for each of the three sets of ROIs, a mean time series for each ROI was calculated by averaging the time series of all voxels within that ROI. Several potential nuisance signals associated with physiological processes were further removed. Specifically, we regressed out estimated head-motion profiles and global signal from each ROI's mean time series <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Wang2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Fox2">[42]</xref>. The residuals were then used to estimate inter-ROI RSFC that were quantified by Pearson correlation coefficient. For each subject at each scan, three correlation matrices (corresponding to three sets of ROIs) consisting of Pearson correlation coefficients between each pair of ROIs were therefore generated.</p>

        <title>Test-retest reliability</title>
        <p>To investigate the TRT reliability of all graph metrics mentioned above, we used a common index of intraclass correlation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Shrout1">[48]</xref>. For each global and nodal network measure derived under each combination of the three factors mentioned above, individual values were first merged into two 25√ó2 matrices (rows corresponding to subjects and column corresponding to scans), with one representing short-term intra-session across scans 2 and 3 and the other long-term inter-session between scan 1 and the average of scans 2 and 3. Additional long-term reliability estimation using scan 1 and scan 3 alone outputted similar results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021976.s014">Table S4</xref>). Therefore, long-term reliability results were reported based on scan 1 and the average of scan 2 and scan 3. Of note, the average was done on individual functional connectivity matrices rather than graph metrics between scan 2 and scan 3, followed by graph metric calculation. Using a one-way ANOVA on each of the two matrices, with random subject effects, we split the total sum of the squares into between-subject (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0021976.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and within-subject (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0021976.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, i.e., residual error) sum of squares. Finally, ICC values were calculated according to the following equation where k is the number of repeated observations per subject <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Shrout1">[48]</xref>:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0021976.e054" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>Of note, the ICC derived from (3) has a relationship with the F-value derived from the one-way ANOVA as follows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Stratford1">[49]</xref>:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0021976.e055" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula>ICC is close to 1 for reliable measures that show low within-subject variance relative to between-subject variance and 0 (negative) otherwise. In the current study, reliability was recorded in terms of the criteria of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Winer1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Sampat1">[51]</xref>, with an ICC value from 0 to 0.25 indicating poor; 0.25 to 0.4 indicating low; 0.4 to 0.6 indicating fair; 0.6 to 0.75 indicating good and 0.75 to 1.0 indicating excellent reliability. Since the network construction was done over a continuous range of sparsity threshold, ICC is a function of the threshold. To provide a threshold-independent reliability assessment, we also calculated the area under curve (AUC, i.e., the integral) for each network metric <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-He4">[52]</xref> that was used to compute a single ICC scalar for each network measure. Finally, we compared the consistency between ICC-based reliability and Pearson correlation coefficient-based similarity analysis (across subjects) for network metrics between scans, which was restricted to S-AAL-based networks.</p>

        <title>Simulation analysis</title>
        <p>To investigate the effects of numerical changes in RSFC on network metric reliability, we performed simulation analyses as follows: individual functional connectivity matrices based on S-AAL were calculated using dataset of scan1 and their corresponding network metrics (both global and nodal metrics) were used as reference values. Then, for each correlation matrix, different levels of independent Gaussian noise were added and all network metrics were recomputed. The added Gaussian noise were zero mean and the variances varied across six equally spaced levels corresponding to 8.3%, 16.7%, 25.0%, 33.3%, 41.7% and 50.0% of actual functional connectivity variances for each subject. This procedure assures the same proportion of noise added to each correlation matrix. Of note, the procedure of noise addition was performed 5 times. Therefore, 25 (subjects) <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0021976.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 6 (noise levels) <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0021976.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 5 (random times)‚Ää=‚Ää750 functional connectivity matrices were simulated in total. Finally, the TRT reliability of each metric was calculated between the reference values and those obtained from simulated functional networks under each level of noise and then averaged across 5 rounds of noise addition.</p>

Of note, those reliable connections were mainly related with ROIs designated as default mode network according to previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Dosenbach1">[40]</xref>. In addition, short-term reliability was found to positively correlate with long-term reliability across all connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021976-g004">Fig. 4c</xref>, Pearson correlation, r‚Ää=‚Ää0.337, p&lt;10<sup>-300</sup>).</p>

          <p>In the present study, individual networks were constructed at the same sparsity level by applying subject-specific correlation thresholds to individual correlation matrices (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021976.s004">Fig. S4</xref> for the corresponding correlation thresholds under each sparsity level). Sparsity threshold ensures all resultant networks to have comparable topological structures of the same number of edges. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021976-g005">Figure 5</xref> shows the TRT reliability of 12 global network metrics over the whole sparisty range. Generally, most global network metrics exhibited poor to low reliability, irrespective of the factors of TI, NT and NM. For example, clustering coefficient <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0021976.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was found to uniformly exhibit poor reliability (ICC&lt;0.25) under all conditions. Nonetheless, we noted that some global metrics (e.g., lambda<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0021976.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and assortativity <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0021976.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) exhibited modest long-term reliability when the networks were sparsely connected (sparsity&lt;10%). Interestingly, we found that global network reliability appeared to depend on the factors of TI and NM but relatively insensitive to NT by qualitatively visual inspection. Specifically, long-term scans seemed to be associated with better reliability in compared with short-term scans and the exclusion of negative correlations enhanced network reliability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021976-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). These were reflected in both increased ICC values and the broadened threshold range of high ICC. Finally, a threshold-independent reliability scalar was obtained for each global network metric by using the AUC. Again, several specific global metrics (e.g., lambda<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0021976.e061" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) demonstrated moderate long-term reliability under certain analytical schemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021976-g006">Fig. 6a</xref>, left). Of note, we found that assortativity <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0021976.e062" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>showed moderated both short-term and long-term reliability for networks of positive correlations.</p>

              <p>Areas under curves (AUCs) of each metrics were used to provide threshold-independent reliability estimation. Different metrics showed variable levels of reliability. Several of them were moderately reliable (e.g., lambda for S-AAL-based networks). Subsequent statistical analysis revealed significant differences in TRT reliability among the 12 global network metrics for S-AAL- but not for F-DOS-based networks.

          <p>Beyond the descriptive results mentioned above, we further performed statistical analyses to test the differences in reliability among 12 global metrics (one-way repeated-measure ANOVA) and the effects of TI, NM and NT on the reliability of global network metrics (three-factor repeated-measure ANOVA). Those AUC-based ICC values were used for the statistical analyses. The results showed that TRT reliability differed significantly (F(11,77)‚Ää=‚Ää3.434, p‚Ää=‚Ää0.001) among 12 global network metrics with lambda <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0021976.e063" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> showing the highest reliability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021976-g006">Fig. 6b</xref>, left). Furthermore, TI (F(1,11)‚Ää=‚Ää8.176, p‚Ää=‚Ää0.016) and NM (F(1,11)‚Ää=‚Ää4.492, p‚Ää=‚Ää0.058) showed significant or marginally significant main effects on global network reliability, respectively. In addition, a significant interaction was observed between TI and NT (F(1,11)‚Ää=‚Ää5.317 , p‚Ää=‚Ää0.042). NT and other interactions were not significant (p&gt;0.05). Further post-hoc comparisons (paired t-tests) revealed that long-term scans outperformed short-term scans only for binarized networks (t(23)‚Ää=‚Ää5.100, p&lt;10<sup>‚àí4</sup>) but not for weighted networks (t(23)‚Ää=‚Ää1.333, p‚Ää=‚Ää0.196) and excluding negative correlations increased the reliability (t(47)‚Ää=‚Ää3.228, p‚Ää=‚Ää0.002) of global network metrics.

          <p>First, nodal reliability patterns did not show remarkable differences associated with the factors of TI, NM and NT by visual inspection. To test whether or not there exist differences in the TRT reliability associated with these factors, three-factor repeated-measure ANOVA was further performed on the mean ICC values over all nodes. Results revealed that none of these three factors had significant main effects or interactions on the mean nodal reliability (p&gt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0021976-t003">Table 3</xref>).</p>
          <p>Second, nodal reliability exhibited variable patterns across nodal attributes under each combination of the three factors. Further one-factor repeated-measure ANOVA on the mean nodal reliability over regions supported this finding that there was significant (F(5,35)‚Ää=‚Ää6.578, p‚Ää=‚Ää0.0002) differences among the six nodal metrics examined, with the highest ICC values and least variance for nodal degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021976-g008">Fig. 8a</xref>).</p>

          <p>Finally, nodal reliability distributed non-uniformly over the brain, an observation irrespective of nodal metrics and factors of TI, NM and NT. To highlight those reliable regions, we selectively mapped nodal reliability of degree of all regions after averaging over factors of TI, NM and NT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021976-g009">Fig. 9a</xref>). This was because nodal degree showed higher reliability and less variance as compared to other nodal metrics and was robust to TI and NM as well as NT. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021976-g009">Figure 9a</xref>, some association and limbic/paralimbic cortex regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Mesulam1">[53]</xref> exhibited fair reliability that were predominately located in bilateral parietal and occipital lobes, such as association cortex regions of the left angular gyrus (ANG), right paracentral lobule (PCL), right precuneus (PCUN), bilateral supramarginal gyrus (SMG), bilateral dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus (SFGdor), right medial superior frontal gyrus (SFGmed) and left superior occipital gyrus (SOG), and limbic/paralimbic regions of the bilateral hippocampus (HIP) and the left posterior cingulate gyrus. In addition, one primary cortex region of the left calcarine fissure (CAL) was also found to be fairly reliable. To test whether or not nodal reliability was related with nodal centrality, we also mapped the mean nodal degree over TI, NM and NT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021976-g009">Fig. 9b</xref>) and found visually different patterns between nodal degree and nodal reliability. The most reliable regions located on the posterior while the most connected regions on the anterior portions of the brain. Further quantitative correlation analysis revealed that only tiny variance (R<sup>2</sup>&lt;7%) in nodal reliability could be explained by nodal degree centrality in both cases of with (r‚Ää=‚Ää0.255, p‚Ää=‚Ää0.015, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021976-g009">Fig. 9c</xref>) and without (r‚Ää=‚Ää0.263, p‚Ää=‚Ää0.012, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021976-g009">Fig. 9d</xref>) correction for regional nodal size. To test whether there exist a relationship between spatial location and nodal reliability, we compared nodal degree reliability between anterior (y&gt;0) and posterior (y&lt;0) regions. The results revealed that posterior regions were more reliable than anterior regions even if nodal mean functional connectivity differences were corrected (t(87)‚Ää=‚Ää2.801, p‚Ää=‚Ää0.006). In addition, we also found dramatically different patterns across nodal metrics even for those most reliable regions except for the right PCL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021976.s005">Fig. S5a</xref>).</p>

          <p>By simulating functional connectivity matrices with different levels of noise, we found that: 1) for global network metrics, the TRT reliability was sensitive (F(5,55)‚Ää=‚Ää23.303, p&lt;10<sup>-11</sup>, repeated two-way ANOVA) to disturbances in functional connectivity values and weighted network analysis generated numerically more (F(1,11)‚Ää=‚Ää5.183, p‚Ää=‚Ää0.044, repeated two-way ANOVA) reliable results than binarized network analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021976-g011">Fig. 11</xref>); 2) for nodal network metrics, although sensitive to the levels of noise (F(5,25)‚Ää=‚Ää7.762, p&lt;10<sup>‚àí3</sup>, repeated two-way ANOVA), they were highly resistant to numerical changes in functional connectivity and there were no differences (F(1,5)‚Ää=‚Ää0.312, p‚Ää=‚Ää0.601, repeated two-way ANOVA) in the resistance to noise between binarized and weighted network analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021976-g012">Fig. 12</xref>); 3) there were no differences in numerical stability against noise in functional connectivity (p&gt;0.05 under each noise level) between the first-order and second-order network metrics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0021976-t002">Table 2</xref>); 4) nodal network metrics were more numerically reliable than global network against noise in functional connectivity (p&lt;10<sup>‚àí3</sup> under each noise level).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the present study, we examined the test-retest reliability of topological metrics of intrinsic connectivity networks derived from human brain R-fMRI data. First, we replicated previous findings that RSFC exhibited modest to high test-retest reliability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Shehzad1">[27]</xref>. Further reliability analyses of network metrics highlighted several main findings: 1) that global network metrics showed overall poor to low but threshold-sensitive reliability; 2) that local nodal metrics were fairly reliable for association and limbic/paralimbic cortex regions; 3) that reliability of network metrics (both global and local) differed significantly among the measures examined; 4) that reliability of global network metrics depended on multiple experiment and analytical factors while nodal reliability was robust to these factors; and 5) that weighted networks (compared to binarized networks) and nodal (compared to global) network metrics were numerically more reliable in the face of noise in functional connectivity. Taken together, we provided a systematically quantitative TRT reliability evaluation of topological metrics of R-fMRI based brain networks. Our findings suggested continued usage of graph theoretical approaches to explore brain networks and had potential relevance for guiding graph analytical schemes for R-fMRI to achieve reliable results.</p>
      <p>For global network metrics, we observed overall low TRT reliability. This observation was consistent with results reported in a previous MEG study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Deuker1">[12]</xref>. Indeed, compared with task engagement, Deuker et al. (2009) found that resting state was related with significantly lower reliability of global network metrics. This may be related to variable mental states of participants across scans which induce variations in RSFC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Greicius1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Horovitz1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Horovitz2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Martuzzi1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Harrison1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Waites1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Albert1">[25]</xref>. Such discrepancies in RSFC especially in shortcuts or inter-module/component connections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-He5">[54]</xref> may further affect the topological organization of the overall connectivity network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Spoormaker1">[28]</xref>. To test the possibility, we examined the differences in RSFC strength between scans by paired t-tests. The results revealed that no connections showed significant differences (p&lt;0.05, corrected) across scans, implying the temporal stability of RSFC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Shehzad1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Zuo1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Zuo3">[31]</xref>. Despite of non-significant differences, our simulation analysese indicated that global network metrics were extremely sensitive to numerical changes in RSFC, especially for small-world parameters and network efficiency. Another possible origin of low TRT reliability is due to low between-subject variance or low ability of global network metrics to differentiate subjects. With that said, the low TRT reliability of global metrics may suggest high consistency of global properties of intrinsic brain networks across subjects. Finally, the noise resulting from MRI data acquisition and coregistration inaccuracy may also influence network reliability, which should be elucidated in the future work.</p>
      <p>Despite of the overall low TRT reliability, some global metrics showed relatively high reliability. For example, lambda showed moderate long-term reliability for structural both S-AAL and S-HOA-based networks. This may be due to the correction of absolute characteristic path length to referenced random networks which compensates for underlying differences of baseline networks. Further statistical analyses revealed significant differences in TRT reliability among global metrics, suggesting an obvious heterogeneity among different global network metrics in reliably capturing intrinsic brain architecture. Moreover, the profiles of global network reliability presented threshold sensitive patterns indicating the importance of threshold selection for reliable results. These findings raise the question of how to determine threshold for brain network studies. A compromise strategy is to investigate brain networks over a continuum threshold range under the circumstance that no sufficient knowledge exists for prior threshold selection.</p>
      <p>Several factors were found to significantly affect the TRT reliability of global network metrics. First, inclusion of negative functional connectivity in brain networks tended to decrease TRT reliability of global network properties. Previous evidence has manifested that negative correlations showed greater population and state related variance in the spatial maps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Tian1">[55]</xref> and lower TRT reliability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Shehzad1">[27]</xref> relative to positive correlations. Consistent with these findings, our results suggest that negative connectivity should be treated with cautions for resting-state brain network studies, which may reduce the TRT reliability. It should be noted that the emergence of negative connectivity is related with the global signal regression, a currently controversial step in preprocessing R-fMRI data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Fox3">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Murphy1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Weissenbacher1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Birn1">[59]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Second, binarized networks outperformed weighted networks in TRT reliability of global network metrics. This finding seemed counterintuitive. Indeed, weighted networks could characterize network topology more precisely and detect more subtle network topological changes than binarized networks due to the consideration of connectivity strength <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Cole1">[60]</xref>. However, this is not necessary to mean better reliability for weighted networks since the possibility that weighted networks may introduce simultaneously extra noise or overly model individual specific details. All these may lead to more within-subject variance (i.e., variance across scans) and thus lower reliability. Of note, our simulation results showed that weighted networks generated numerically more stable results against noise in functional connectivity in comparison to binarized networks. This suggests that the observed reliability derived from actual R-fMRI data were affected by various factors, not a single factor of numerical changes in functional connectivity.</p>
      <p>Third, long-term scans showed higher TRT reliability of global network metrics than short-term scans. This finding was contrast to previous findings that RSFC exhibited higher TRT reliability for short-term interval scans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Shehzad1">[27]</xref>. It may reflect the fact that the average of scan2 and scan3 in the current study can potentially improve the estimation of long-term reliability, i.e., reduce within-session noise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Zuo1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Zuo2">[30]</xref>. To test this interpretation, we further calculated the long-term TRT reliability by using scan1 and scan3 and again found a long-term-larger-than-short-term pattern, indicating a robust finding. Nevertheless, further work is needed to verify this finding and aid in our understanding of how network topology interacts with the scanning procedure of time interval.</p>
      <p>Finally, TRT reliability of global network metrics was modulated by strategies of network node definition. Specifically, reliability of only structural (S-AAL and S-HOA) rather than functional (F-DOS) ROIs-based networks depended on the factors of TI, NM and NT. The discrepancy may reflect different approaches of generating ROIs. Structural ROIs were obtained mainly in terms of anatomical features of sulcal pattern (S-AAL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-TzourioMazoyer1">[37]</xref> or standard anatomical boundaries (S-HOA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Kennedy1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Makris1">[39]</xref> whereas functional ROIs were derived from previous meta-analyses of fMRI activation studies which carried specific functional information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Dosenbach1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Dosenbach2">[41]</xref>. Furthermore, even for structural ROIs based networks, the modulations of TI, NM and NT differed across parcellations. Previous studies have demonstrated that network properties were sensitive to nodal definition based on parcellation strategies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Wang2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-SanabriaDiaz1">[36]</xref> and spatial scales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Hayasaka1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Zalesky1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Fornito1">[35]</xref>. Nevertheless, it's hard to conclude which approach or which parcellation is better since all of them are valid and important approaches to uncover brain connectivity architecture from different perspectives <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Dosenbach1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Achard1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Salvador1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-AlexanderBloch1">[62]</xref>. Here, our results provide references for studying intrinsic brain networks, for example, binarized networks should be preferred for S-HOA-based intrinsic brain networks according to our results.</p>
      <p>For local nodal metrics, nodal degree showed the highest reliability and least variance across factors of TI, NM and NT among the six nodal metrics. Using this metric, we found that some association cortex and limbic/paralimbic regions exhibited fair to good TRT reliability for S-AAL and S-HOA derived networks, such as precuneus, angular gyrus, superior forntal gurus, paracentral lobule, supramarginal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus. Most of these regions have been identified to serve as structural or functional hubs/connectors in human brain networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Achard1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Gong1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-He5">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Cole1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Hagmann1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Buckner1">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Yan1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Chen1">[66]</xref>. For F-DOS derived networks, more regions were modestly reliable, predominately located in the right frontal lobe and bilateral parietal and temporal lobes. Hubs are essential in supporting the performance of high cognitive functions of the human brain by integrating specialized brain regions into coordinated networks. Buckner and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Buckner1">[64]</xref> demonstrated that the topography of human brain cortical hubs is highly similar across populations and robust against task states, therefore reflecting a stable property of brain functional architecture. Here, our results indicate that those reliable regions qualitatively tend to serve as hubs in intrinsic functional brain networks. Nonetheless, our quantitative analysis found that nodal reliability showed low correlations (although significant) with nodal centrality (R<sup>2</sup>&lt;10%), suggesting limited predictive ability of nodal centrality on reliability. These findings imply that there may exist other factors affecting nodal reliability, such as the spatial locations of nodes or regions. Indeed, we found that posterior regions were more reliable than anterior regions even after correcting for the differences in functional connectivity across regions. This may reflect the nature of the brain in which the neural dynamics of spatially different brain regions are differently constrained in the resting-state. It would be an interesting question for future studies. Additionally, we noted that the most reliable regions appeared to predominately locate in the right hemisphere for F-DOS and S-HOA based networks. Hence, exploring brain functional asymmetry from the perspective of reliability may provide more insights into the brain's functional architecture.</p>
      <p>Nodal reliability was found to be robust against the factors of TI, NM and NT, regardless of different node definition strategies. Simulation analyses revealed that nodal metrics were highly tolerant of fluctuations in functional connectivity values and were numerically more stable than global network metrics in the face of connectivity noise. The reliable and robust features of nodal metrics propose local nodal metrics as reliable candidates to reveal topological organization of intrinsic functional brain networks.</p>
      <p>There are several issues that remained to be addressed in future. First, the reliability analyses of graph-based network metrics were conducted after several R-fMRI preprocessing steps. To date, how different preprocessing strategies affect the TRT reliability of network metrics is rarely investigated. Specifically, in the current study, RSFC were obtained based on band-pass filtered data (0.01‚Äì0.1 Hz). Previous R-fMRI studies have demonstrated frequency specific features for RSFC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Salvador2">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Salvador3">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Salvador4">[69]</xref> and network topology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Achard1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Achard2">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Supekar1">[70]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Supekar2">[71]</xref>. Accordingly, exploring the impacts of different preprocessing steps on TRT reliability, especially the filtering frequency bands, is an important topic to determine specific processing schemes for consistent, reliable results. Second, we limited our examination of TRT reliability to 12 global network properties and 6 nodal characteristics, which were widely used to characterize brain network architectures. However, there are still a lot of other network metrics, such as motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Milo1">[72]</xref> and vulnerability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Costa1">[73]</xref> (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Rubinov1">[74]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Boccaletti1">[75]</xref>) whose TRT reliability need to be evaluated in future. Finally, using R-fMRI, we examined the TRT reliability of intrinsic functional brain networks. Previous studies have performed similar analyses of structural or functional brain networks using DTI, MEG, or fMRI data during resting state or cognitive task engagement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Vaessen1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Bassett2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Deuker1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021976-Telesford1">[13]</xref>. Despite these advances, a systematic reliability evaluation using multimodal data from the same cohort of population is warranted to gain more insights into human brain's structural and functional architectures.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we studied the TRT reliability of graph-based network metrics derived from resting-state fMRI data and the effects of several factors on the reliability. Based on our findings, we provide some methodological recommendations for resting-state fMRI community in dealing with brain connectome studies. First, negative correlations need to be excluded or considered with cautions for S-AAL-based brain network studies. Second, binarized networks should be preferred for S-HOA-based brain network studies as compared to weighted networks. Third, reliability of functional ROIs-based networks was robust against the three factors of scanning time, network membership and network type. Finally, nodal metrics (especially nodal degree) could produce more reliable results and are more resilient to functional connectivity disturbances, which should be popularized in future brain network studies. Nonetheless, we pointed out that further work is necessary to standardize the methodological framework on this burgeoning field.</p>
