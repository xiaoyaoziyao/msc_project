<abstract>
<p>Tumor invasion and metastasis involves complex remodeling of gene expression programs governing epithelial homeostasis. Mutational activation of the RAS-ERK is a frequent occurrence in many cancers and has been shown to drive overexpression of the AP-1 family transcription factor FRA1, a potent regulator of migration and invasion in a variety of tumor cell types. However, the nature of FRA1 transcriptional targets and the molecular pathways through which they promote tumor progression remain poorly understood. We found that FRA1 was strongly expressed in tumor cells at the invasive front of human colorectal cancers (CRCs), and that its depletion suppressed mesenchymal-like features in CRC cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. Genome-wide analysis of FRA1 chromatin occupancy and transcriptional regulation identified epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes as a major class of direct FRA1 targets in CRC cells. Expression of the pro-mesenchymal subset of these genes predicted adverse outcomes in CRC patients, and involved FRA-1-dependent regulation and cooperation with TGFβ signaling pathway. Our findings reveal an unexpectedly widespread and direct role for FRA1 in control of epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity in CRC cells, and suggest that FRA1 plays an important role in mediating cross talk between oncogenic RAS-ERK and TGFβ signaling networks during tumor progression.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Local invasion and metastasis of colorectal and some other carcinoma types is thought to involve transient remodeling of the epithelial tumor cell phenotype to an invasive mesenchymal-like state, characterized by defects in tight and adherens junction formation, increase in intermediate filament proteins (e.g. vimentin), and elevated expression of proteases mediating degradation of the extracellular matrix. Such epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) and mesenchymal-epithelial transitions (MET) involve extensive and highly coordinated changes in gene expression, regulated by complex signalling and transcription factor networks that engage master EMT transcription factors belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH), Snail, Twist and ZEB families <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Polyak1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Thompson1">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a genetically heterogeneous disease whose metastatic spread to the liver, lung, peritoneal cavity and bones poses major clinical problems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-LeGolvan1">[4]</xref>. More than 50% of CRCs harbor oncogenic mutations in the <italic>KRAS</italic> or <italic>BRAF</italic> genes, which drive persistent activation of the ERK MAPK pathway. These mutations generally arise at a relatively early stage during adenoma-carcinoma progression, following functional loss of the tumor suppressor APC, and their high incidence of concordance in primary and metastatic cancers suggests that they contribute to both tumor initiation and progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Hung1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Nash1">[8]</xref>. At later stages, some tumors acquire mutations (<italic>TGFBR2</italic>, <italic>SMAD2</italic>, <italic>SMAD3</italic> or <italic>SMAD4</italic>) that disrupt signaling via the TGFβ pathway, which provides growth inhibitory signals in the normal intestinal epithelium.</p>
<p>In CRC, EMT-like events are strongly associated with budding, a pathological phenomenon observed in 20–40% of cases, in which tumor cells detach from the invasive front and invade into the surrounding basement membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Zlobec1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Brabletz1">[10]</xref>. The interplay between EMT and MET has also been suggested to underlie the observation that basement membrane expression is often lost at the invasive front of CRCs, but regained in metastases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Spaderna1">[11]</xref>. More recently, several studies have identified EMT-related gene expression signatures as a common occurrence in primary CRCs, which are strongly associated with poor prognosis and resistance to targeted therapies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Jorissen1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-DeSousa1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>One of the major pathways involved in induction and maintenance of EMT events during development and tumorigenesis is the TGFβ pathway. Although activation of the pathway is growth inhibitory in normal epithelial cells, oncogenic RAS-ERK signaling has been reported to induce a paradoxical switch in its role from tumour suppressor to pro-metastatic factor, in part through activation of EMT-related programs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Thiery1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Eger1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Janda1">[19]</xref>. The mechanisms underlying pro-malignant cross talk between the RAS and TGFβ pathways during CRC progression are not well understood. Perturbation of the TGFβ pathway is a frequent event in CRC. Complete inactivation of TGFβ signaling through mutation of the type II TGFβ receptor (<italic>TGFBR2</italic>) locus is a common occurrence in the 15% of CRCs displaying DNA microsatellite instability (MSI), which ironically are associated with favorable prognostic outcomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Watanabe1">[20]</xref>. The remaining 85% of microsatellite stable (MSS) cancers display chromosomal instability (CIN), and often (∼50% of cases) harbor mutations in the <italic>SMAD4</italic> gene, and less frequently the <italic>SMAD2</italic> and <italic>SMAD3</italic> genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Fleming1">[21]</xref>. Recent studies have shown that the <italic>TGFBR2</italic> genotype is the major factor determining a lack of EMT-like responses to TGFβ1 in MSI-positive tumors, whereas CRC cells with <italic>SMAD4</italic> mutations retain the ability to undergo EMT upon TGFβ1 treatment through coupling with the ERK pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Pino1">[22]</xref>. The nature of ERK pathway effectors required for these responses are presently unclear.</p>
<p>The Activator Protein-1 complex is a key regulator of transcriptional responses induced by various cancer-associated signalling pathways. It consists of homo- or hetero-dimers of Fos, Jun, ATF and MAF family members, whose activities are strongly influenced by oncogenic signaling events. Activating mutations in RAS pathway components have been shown to induce overexpression of the Fos family member FRA1, a highly unstable protein that is expressed at low levels in normal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-MildeLangosch1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Young1">[24]</xref>. Transcriptional induction and post-translational stabilization of FRA1 by oncogenic RAS-ERK signaling increases the relative abundance of FRA1 containing AP-1 dimers, which has been causally linked enhanced migration and invasion of CRC and multiple other carcinoma cell types, including breast, lung, bladder, head and neck, thyroid and brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Pollock1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-MildeLangosch1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Doehn1">[34]</xref>. In addition to the RAS-ERK pathway, FRA1 expression is induced by the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in CRC cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Brabletz2">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Tice1">[41]</xref>, suggesting that it may play a role in integrating signaling through these pathways during CRC progression.</p>
<p>In the present study, we applied a genome-wide approach to better understand the nature of transcriptional programs underlying the pro-malignant actions of FRA1 in CRC. We found that FRA1 binds and regulates expression of a clinically relevant cohort of genes associated with EMT in invasive CRC cells, with stable FRA1 knockdown invoking a MET-like phenotypic switch. FRA1 was strongly enriched in budding tumor cells at the invasive front of human CRCs, and expression of its pro-mesenchymal targets identified a subset of primary cancers with poor prognosis. Mechanistically, we found that activation of mesenchymal genes involved FRA1-dependent regulation and cooperation with TGFβ signaling networks. Collectively, our findings suggest that FRA1 plays a widespread and direct role in transcriptional control of epithelial-mesenchymal programming during CRC progression.</p>

<title>FRA1 is enriched in tumor cells at the invasive front of human CRCs</title>
<p>Although it was previously reported that FRA1 is more highly expressed in CRCs than the normal colorectal epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Zhang1">[35]</xref>, its relationship with tumor pathology has not been established. Using immunohistochemistry, we detected FRA1 immunoreactivity in 20 out of 25 primary tumor specimens. In contrast to its weak expression in the center of tumors, cells at the invasive front exhibited strong FRA1 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088950-g001">Figure 1A–1C</xref>), including cytokeratin AE1/AE3 positive clusters of cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Rettig1">[36]</xref> that had detached from the tumor bulk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088950-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). This latter feature is indicative of tumor budding, a phenomenon associated with the acquisition of mesenchymal-like features by CRC cells, and is an independent predictor of lymph node metastasis, vascular and lymphatic invasion, distant metastasis, local recurrence and poor disease-free survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Zlobec1">[9]</xref>.</p>

<title>FRA1 regulates mesenchymal-like features in CRC cells</title>
<p>Previous investigations on the pro-invasive actions of FRA1 in CRC have used the BE cell line model, which comprises highly invasive mesenchymal-like cells that harbor <italic>KRAS</italic>/<italic>BRAF</italic> mutations driving high endogenous FRA1 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Vial1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Vial2">[37]</xref>. Consistent with its role as a major contributor to AP-1 activity in these cells, stable knockdown of FRA1 using 2 distinct shRNAs constructs reduced both basal and c-Jun stimulated AP-1 reporter gene activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088950-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>). Phenotypically, FRA1 depletion invoked a striking mesenchymal to epithelial-like morphological switch, with cells acquiring a flattened appearance, regaining expression of the epithelial differentiation marker E-cadherin, and forming tight junctions staining positively for ZO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088950-g002">Figure 2A and 2C</xref>). In addition, FRA1-depleted cells almost completely lost their capacity to migrate and invade <italic>in vitro</italic>, but their proliferation rates remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088950-g002">Figure 2D–2F</xref>). Together, these findings suggest a requirement for FRA1 to maintain CRC cells in a mesenchymal-like state.</p>

<title>EMT-related genes are a major class of direct FRA1 targets in CRC cells</title>
<p>To identify direct transcriptional targets and molecular pathways through which FRA1 controls mesenchymal-like features in tumor cells, we performed genome-wide ChIP-Seq and transcriptome analysis to search for genes at which FRA1 binding was enriched, and whose expression was regulated by FRA1 in BE cells. Despite several attempts to optimize the ChIP assay using antibodies targeting endogenous FRA1, we were unable to recover sufficient chromatin to perform subsequent high-throughput sequencing. We therefore generated BE cell lines moderately (∼5-fold higher than endogenous FRA1) overexpressing a FLAG-FRA1 protein, which was localized in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088950-g003">Figure 3A,B</xref>). In contrast to a DNA binding defective variant, wild-type FLAG-FRA1 demonstrated strong enrichment at the promoter of <italic>VIM</italic>, a previously identified direct FRA1 target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088950-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Andreolas1">[38]</xref>.</p>

Only annotated genes undergoing at least a 2-fold change in expression upon FRA1 silencing (p&lt;0.05) were considered, and genes associated with multiple FLAG-FRA1 peaks were only counted once. (E) Ontological analysis of genes identified after intersection of the microarray and ChIP-Seq datasets. Genes were clustered into major biological pathways using GeneGo.</p>

<p>Using microarrays, we found that FRA1 knockdown in BE cells significantly up-regulated expression of 1392 genes while reducing expression of 832 genes by at least 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088950-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). ChIP-Seq analysis revealed that 72% percent of the FRA1-regulated genes contained loci significantly enriched for FRA1 binding (&gt;5-fold) within 5 kb of their transcription start site (TSS). To identify major functional classes of FRA1 target genes, we intersected the microarray and ChIP-Seq data and interrogated overlapping genes for enrichment of gene ontology terms (using GeneGo). Of the top 6 groups identified using this approach, 3 were significantly enriched for genes associated with EMT-related processes, while a further 3 groups featured adhesion-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088950-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). These findings indicated that EMT and adhesion are two major processes under direct FRA1 transcriptional control in CRC cells.</p>
<p>Based on the phenotypic changes resulting from FRA1 knockdown in BE cells, and the association between tumour budding and EMT in CRC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Zlobec1">[9]</xref>, we chose to focus on the involvement of FRA1 in regulating EMT events in CRC. Collectively the EMT-related genes bound and regulated by FRA1 (herein termed FRA1<sup>EMT</sup> genes) encoded a diverse array of proteins involved cell adhesion, signal transduction, transcription, cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix remodeling, as well as components of TGFβ signaling networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088950-g004">Figure 4A</xref> and Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0088950.s001">File S1</xref>). These genes broadly comprised a pro-mesenchymal subset whose expression was promoted by FRA1 and an epithelial subset that was repressed by FRA1. Many of the genes contained multiple loci occupied by FRA1, which were primarily located within intronic regions of the gene body and in distal upstream sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088950-g004">Figure 4B</xref> and Table S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0088950.s001">File S1</xref>).

<p>We also found that high levels of FRA1 gene (<italic>FOSL1</italic>) expression independently predicted poor recurrence-free survival and was associated with a higher T-stage, an index of advanced tumor invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088950-g005">Figure 5A</xref> and Table S5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0088950.s001">File S1</xref>). Although <italic>FOSL1</italic> expression was detected in both epithelial- and mesenchymal-like tumors, its expression was significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) in the latter group.

<title>Cross talk between FRA1 and TGFβ signalling controls mesenchymal gene expression</title>
<p>Given their association with adverse clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088950-g005">Figure 5</xref>), we next sought to gain a deeper mechanistic insight into FRA1-dependent control of mesenchymal expression programs in CRC cells. In particular, we wondered if in addition to directly binding and regulating their transcription, FRA1 could promote expression of pro-mesenchymal genes by modulating the activities of EMT-associated signaling pathways whose components we had identified as direct FRA1 targets. The most highly represented of these were genes acting in TGFβ signaling networks, including those encoding activating (<italic>TGFB2</italic>) and inhibitory ligands (<italic>BMP4</italic>, <italic>BMP7</italic>), whose expression was promoted or repressed by FRA1, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088950-g004">Figure 4A, 4C and 4E</xref>). Being the only activating ligand identified as a FRA1 target, we chose to investigate the potential contribution of TGFβ2 signaling in regulating expression of a selection of FRA1<sup>EMT</sup> targets. Transient knockdown of <italic>TGFB2</italic> in parental BE cells significantly reduced expression of several pro-mesenchymal (<italic>AXL</italic>, <italic>VIM</italic>) but not epithelial (<italic>CDH1</italic>, <italic>CLDN7</italic>) FRA1 target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088950-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Similar effects were also observed upon transient knockdown of another FRA1 bound target acting in the pathway, encoding the transcription factor SMAD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088950-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). To directly examine the possibility that a FRA1-dependent autocrine TGFβ2 loop was operating in these cells, they were treated with the type 1 TGFβ receptor inhibitor SB43152 to block transduction of TGFβ2 signals. Consistent with the effects of <italic>TGFB2</italic> knockdown, we found that expression of several pro-mesenchymal FRA1 targets (<italic>AXL</italic>, <italic>VIM</italic>, <italic>TGFBI</italic>) was significantly reduced after 3 days of SB43152 treatment.</p>

<p>To further investigate the extent of cross talk between FRA1 and the TGFβ pathway, we assessed the expression of several mesenchymal and epithelial FRA1 targets in another <italic>KRAS</italic> mutant TGFβ-responsive CRC cell line, SW837. Despite FRA1 levels being elevated in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088950-g007">Figure 7A</xref>), their expression of the pro-mesenchymal genes <italic>VIM</italic> and <italic>AXL</italic> was low when compared to BE cells, while the epithelial genes <italic>CDH1</italic> and <italic>CLDN7</italic> were highly expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088950-g007">Figure 7B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The local invasion and metastatic spread of cancers involves specific, highly coordinated and dynamic remodeling of tumor cell gene expression through bidirectional cross talk between signaling and transcriptional networks. Much remains to be understood about how these networks are regulated by tumor-associated genetic and epigenetic lesions, and the mechanisms through which they are coordinated to induce specific changes in gene expression during invasion.</p>
<p>The transcription factor AP-1 has long been implicated as a central regulator of tumor cell invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Ozanne1">[39]</xref>. FRA1 is one of the most frequently overexpressed AP-1 proteins in solid cancers, and its ability to promote migratory and invasive traits in a variety of different tumor cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Adiseshaiah1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Tkach1">[32]</xref> suggests that its actions involve engagement of common targets and pathways. The identity of these pathways is presently unclear, while only a handful of its direct transcriptional targets in carcinoma cells identified to date. Through analysis of its genome-wide chromatin occupancy and target gene regulation, the present study identifies genes and pathways involved in cell adhesion and EMT as major classes of direct FRA1 targets associated with CRC progression.</p>
<p>EMT-like gene expression signatures have been reported to correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to targeted therapies in CRC patients, but the mechanisms governing their genesis are poorly understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Jorissen1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-DeSousa1">[15]</xref>. Our findings suggest that FRA1-regulated transcriptional events play an important role in this process, with elevated levels of pro-mesenchymal FRA1 targets associated with adverse outcomes in about half of all stage B and stage C cancers, while high levels of FRA1 gene (<italic>FOSL1</italic>) expression in these mesenchymal-type identifying cancers with poorest prognosis.</p>
<p>Pathological EMT in CRC strongly linked with tumor budding, an independent prognostic indicator of higher lymph node metastasis, vascular and lymphatic invasion, distant metastasis, local recurrence and poor disease-free survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Zlobec1">[9]</xref>. While FRA1 expression appears relatively homogenous in tumor cell lines, we found that it was highly enriched at invasive regions and in budding cells but not the center of primary tumors. The mechanism underlying this restricted expression in tumors is presently unclear, however a similar localization pattern has been reported for the Wnt pathway transcriptional effector, β-catenin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Brabletz2">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Tice1">[41]</xref>. As β-catenin induces transcription of the FRA1 gene in CRC cells, FRA1/β-catenin cooperativity may play an important role in controlling localized transcription of pro-invasive genes in colorectal tumors, a notion supported by our finding that FRA1 directly binds and regulates several pro-invasive β-catenin targets, including <italic>MMP14</italic>, <italic>LAMC2</italic>, <italic>VIM</italic> and <italic>ZEB1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Spaderna1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Hlubek1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-SanchezTillo1">[46]</xref>.</p>
<p>The induction of EMT involves remodeling of multiple cellular processes, including adhesion, signaling, transcription, and extracellular matrix remodeling. There is growing evidence that tumor cells often exhibit only some of these changes, for example expressing a subset of mesenchymal markers while retaining epithelial features <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Thompson1">[3]</xref>. The ability of tumor cells to transit from an epithelial to mesenchymal-like state is thus likely to be highly context-specific, and require cooperativity between multiple signaling and transcriptional networks. The ability of FRA1 to bind and regulate genes involved in different EMT-associated processes suggests that it may play an important role in coordinated EMT events. Interestingly, in BE CRC cells, FRA1 binding was involved both in maintaining expression of pro-mesenchymal genes, while repressing an epithelial subset. Several potential mechanisms may contribute to these opposing effects of FRA1, including its assembly into distinct FRA1/Jun complexes within the same cells, its coupling with different signaling networks, and ability to promote expression of the master EMT transcriptional factors, ZEB1 and/or SNAI2. Additionally, FRA1 binding may result in localized changes in chromatin dynamics, a role recently ascribed to AP-1 in regulating the inducibility of glucorticoid receptor targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Biddie1">[47]</xref>. FRA1 may thus contribute to the generation of permissive chromatin contexts, necessary for both the reprogramming of CRC cells to a mesenchymal state, and subsequently to sustain the operation of mesenchymal programs when tumour cells disseminate. Interestingly, the major regions of AP-1 binding identified previously near glucocorticoid receptor targets and in the present study occurred upstream of target gene promoters or within introns, implicating a role for FRA1 in transcriptional control at an enhancer level and/or downstream of transcription initiation (e.g. elongation).</p>
<p>While stable FRA1 knockdown invoked a MET-like phenotypic change in BE cells, we have noted that many FRA1-overexpressing CRC cell lines retain epithelial features (ASD, unpublished). Thus FRA1 expression alone is not sufficient to drive EMT-like cellular changes, but may do so in cooperation with other pathways. Indeed, we identified components of several signaling networks as direct FRA1 targets in BE cells, with the most highly represented acting in the TGFβ pathway. We found that an underlying function of FRA1 in CRC cells was to positively regulate TGFβ signaling, which it could do via several mechanisms; in the mesenchymal-like BE cell line, its binding modulated expression of multiple TGFβ pathway components, including maintaining operation of an autocrine TGFβ2 loop that promoted expression of mesenchymal genes. However, in epithelial-like SW837 CRC cells where autocrine TGFβ signaling was not established, FRA1 was required for TGFβ-induced mesenchymal gene expression responses. Collectively our findings suggest that FRA1 may play an important role in coupling oncogenic RAS-ERK signaling with the TGFβ pathway to control EMT-like responses in CRC cells. We suggest that FRA1 may have a similar function in other cancers where it is overexpressed such as breast, where FRA1 has recently been shown to play an important role in regulating EMT events and metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Desmet1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Tam1">[48]</xref>, and in which the TGFβ and RAS-ERK pathways have been reported to cooperate during EMT induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Janda1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>From a clinical perspective, our findings are consistent with recent work showing that induction of EMT is impaired in microsatellite instable (MSI) colon cancer cells due to the presence of <italic>TGFBR2</italic> mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Pino1">[22]</xref>. Interestingly, CRC cells harboring <italic>SMAD4</italic> mutations were found to retain the ability to undergo EMT-like changes in response to TGFβ by coupling with the ERK pathway. We suggest that FRA1 may be a critical ERK pathway effector regulating EMT-like changes in these cells. Consistent with this notion, we have found that TGFβ-mediated induction of SNAI2 in <italic>SMAD4</italic> mutant SW480 CRC cells is regulated FRA1 (ASD, unpublished).</p>
<p>In summary, the present work reveals an unexpectedly widespread and direct role for FRA1 in transcriptional control of clinically relevant programs governing epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity. We also show that these actions of FRA1 are intricately linked with its coupling to the TGFβ signaling network. Approaches to inactivate FRA1 and/or pathways through which its pro-malignant actions are mediated may hence provide an approach to modulate EMT-MET balances and impede the spread of CRC and other cancers in which the RAS-ERK pathway is hyperactive.</p>

<p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Sanij1">[55]</xref>. For each ChIP assay, we incubated 25 µl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity beads (Sigma-Aldrich) overnight with cross-linked chromatin fragments from 1.5×10<sup>7</sup> BE cells stably expressing pBABE-FLAG-FRA1 or empty vector (negative control). High-throughput sequencing of immunoprecipitated FLAG/StrepII-FRA1 and input chromatin was performed on an Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Illumina). We used 12.5 ng of ChIPed DNA to prepare sequencing libraries and sequenced two flow cell lanes per sample. Selected FRA1 targets were validated by ChIP followed by qPCR, with relative enrichment levels calculated after normalising against background enrichment determined in the negative control. The 36 bp ChIP-Seq reads were aligned to the human b37/hg19 reference genome using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Li1">[56]</xref> and peaks were called using Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Zhang2">[57]</xref>. Input genomic sequences served as negative control. Statistical analysis of the resulting bam file and peaks was performed with the R package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.R-project.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.R-project.org</ext-link>). The Bioconductor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Gentleman1">[58]</xref>, Rsamtools and ChIPpeakAnno packages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Zhu1">[59]</xref> were used to extract data from the bam files and to annotate the predicted peaks. Using custom scripts, the human genome was split into 1 kb bins and the number of tags in each bin calculated. Predicted peaks within 250 bp of each other were combined and each resulting peak matched with a bin. The number of tags at each summit was calculated and a normalised fold change, taking into account total reads, was calculated for the summit, peak and bin regions. Each peak was annotated using Ensembl GRCh37 version 61. Subsequently, motif analysis was performed using the MEME suite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Bailey1">[60]</xref> and the data visualised with the Integrative Genomic Viewer (IGV 2.0) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Robinson1">[61]</xref>. Comparison of ChIP-Seq reads near FRA1<sup>EMT</sup> genes to a known AP-1 motif (MA0099.1, Jaspar core database) was performed using FIMO (MEME suite), with a p-value threshold less than 0.0001. Further data analysis was performed using the Galaxy platform <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Goecks1">[62]</xref>. The pie chart illustrating the location of ChIP-Seq reads relative to the transcription start site (TSS) of FRA1<sup>EMT</sup> was generated using SoleSearch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Blahnik1">[63]</xref>. Gene cluster analysis of genes identified by microarray and ChIP-Seq was performed using GeneGo. EMT-related genes identified by GeneGo in both datasets were termed FRA1<sup>EMT</sup> genes.</p>

<title>Analysis of gene expression in human tumors</title>
<p>Previously published gene expression data were retrieved for primary colorectal cancers from 91 stage B and 94 stage C patients from the Royal Melbourne Hospital, Western Hospital, and Peter MacCallum Cancer Center in Australia, and the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center in the United States <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Jorissen1">[12]</xref>. The median age at cancer diagnosis was 67 years (range 26–92 years); 98 patients were male and 87 were female. Follow-up and adjuvant treatment details were available from Biogrid Australia for Australian patients and the Moffitt Cancer Center Tumor Registry for U.S. patients. All samples had been analysed using HG-U133Plus2.0 GeneChip arrays (Affymetrix). Array data were RMA normalized and expression values log2 transformed. For unsupervised clustering, expression values for FRA1 silencing associated EMT genes were mean and sample centered followed by divisive hierarchical clustering using pair distances calculated as 1 minus the Spearman r as distance metric. Differences in mean gene expression values were calculated for the samples within the two main branches of the resulting dendrogram and assessed for statistical significance using the t-test with Benjamini and Hochberg multiple-testing correction. Relative upregulation or downregulation of gene expression between these two groups was assessed for consistency with upregulation or downregulation observed between FRA1 silencing and control cells using Pearson's χ<sup>2</sup> test. All data processing and analysis were conducted using the statistical software package R and associated Bioconductor packages. Data processing and analysis were conducted using the statistical software package R. Differences between groups were assessed using the χ2 test for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables. For the outcome analysis, recurrence-free survival was defined as the time of surgery to the first confirmed relapse. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated using the PrognoScan algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088950-Mizuno1">[64]</xref>. Censoring was done when a patient died or was alive without recurrence at last contact. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to estimate survival distributions and hazard ratios, and were adjusted for patient characteristics as indicted. All statistical analyses were 2-sided and considered significant if P&lt;0.05.</p>
