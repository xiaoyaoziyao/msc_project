        <p>Whereas detrimental effects of vitamin D deficiency are known over century, the effects of vitamin D receptor activation by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>, the principal hormonal form of vitamin D, on the growing bone and its growth plate are less clear. Currently, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> is used in pediatric patients with chronic kidney disease and mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) and is strongly associated with growth retardation. Here, we investigate the effect of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> treatment on bone development in normal young rats, unrelated to renal insufficiency. Young rats received daily i.p. injections of 1 µg/kg 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> for one week, or intermittent 3 µg/kg 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> for one month. Histological analysis revealed narrower tibial growth plates, predominantly in the hypertrophic zone of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-treated animals in both experimental protocols. This phenotype was supported by narrower distribution of aggrecan, collagens II and X mRNA, shown by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. Concomitant with altered chondrocyte maturation, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> increased chondrocyte proliferation and apoptosis in terminal hypertrophic cells. <italic>In vitro</italic> treatment of the chondrocytic cell line ATDC5 with 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> lowered differentiation and increased proliferation dose and time-dependently. Micro-CT analysis of femurs from 1-week 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-treated group revealed reduced cortical thickness, elevated cortical porosity, and higher trabecular number and thickness. 1-month administration resulted in a similar cortical phenotype but without effect on trabecular bone. Evaluation of fluorochrome binding with confocal microscopy revealed inhibiting effects of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> on intracortical bone formation. This study shows negative effects of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> on growth plate and bone which may contribute to the exacerbation of MBD in the CKD pediatric patients.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>During childhood, the skeleton undergoes rapid structural adaptations to the growing body demands, manifested by changes in the bone mineral composition, cortical and trabecular architecture and altered mechanical properties. Bone mass acquisition is orchestrated by a variety of factors ranging from genetic determinants and nutritional influences, to the hormonal balance, including classical regulation of mineral homeostasis by vitamin D <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Bouillon1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Dusso1">[2]</xref>. Vitamin D is obtained from dietary sources and is synthesized in the skin by photoconversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3, which subsequently undergoes two major modifications. First, it is metabolized in the liver to produce the circulating form 25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> (25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>, calcidiol), which is later converted in the kidney and other tissues including bone by 1α-hydroxylase to generate the active form 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> (1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>, calcitriol). 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> is the principal hormonal form of vitamin D which binds to vitamin D receptor (VDR), exerting a wide range of biological responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Bouillon1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Dusso1">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Whereas detrimental effects of vitamin D deficiency on bone growth have been known over a century, the direct effects of VDR activation on the growth plate are still a matter of investigation. Analysis of transgenic VDR or 1α-hydroxylase null mice revealed phenotypic abnormalities characteristic of vitamin D-dependent rickets, with decreased bone mineralization, growth retardation and aberrant growth plate development after weaning. Impaired apoptosis of hypertrophic chondrocytes, with ordinary proliferation, was demonstrated to cause the significant widening and disorganization of the epiphyseal growth plates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Donohue1">[3]</xref>. These phenotypes could largely be corrected by rescue supplementation of dietary calcium and phosphate, suggesting a primary systemic role of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> in intestinal calcium absorption <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Amling1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Dardenne1">[5]</xref>. In contrast, transplantation of VDR null bone into wild-type mice resulted in increased bone mass and <italic>vice versa</italic>, transplantation of wild-type bone into VDR null mice developed osteopenia, implying a direct inhibitory role of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> in osteogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Tanaka1">[6]</xref>. To support these data, conditional VDR inactivation in growth plate chondrocytes has been shown to reduce vascular invasion and osteoclast numbers leading to increased trabecular bone mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Masuyama1">[7]</xref>. Two additional transgenic mice models with chondrocytes-specific 1α-hydroxylase ablation or overexpression, revealed a “mirror image” growth plate phenotype with increased hypertrophic zone width, reduced osteoclastogenesis and delayed angiogenesis in the former, while decreased hypertrophic zone width, enhanced osteoclastogenesis and induced angiogenesis in the later, further supporting the paracrine role 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> in the process of endochondral ossification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Naja1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Besides its physiological role, the pharmacological influence of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> on bone development in pediatric patients is not fully understood. In the clinical settings, administration of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> is currently used as a standard of care treatment combating both 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> deficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism in children with chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Sanchez1">[9]</xref>. In the pediatric patients, diminished renal function is commonly accompanied by a disturbed bone metabolism, reduced linear growth and the presence of ectopic soft tissue calcifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Sanchez1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Wesseling1">[10]</xref>. Despite its widespread use, accumulating evidence points towards severe side effects and chronic toxicity associated with active vitamin D treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Wesseling1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Querfeld1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Sanchez2">[12]</xref>. Observational studies suggest that chronic use of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> is strongly associated with suppression of PTH and development of adynamic bone disease (ABD), characterized by low bone turnover and diminished osteoblast and osteoclast activities, in children with renal insufficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Sanchez1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Wesseling1">[10]</xref>. Clinical studies performed in children on peritoneal dialysis treated for 12 months with intermittent calcitriol therapy and calcium salts as phosphate binders, demonstrated diminished linear growth and induction of ABD, accompanied by significant reduction in PTH and episodes of hypercalcemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Kuizon1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Salusky1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Goodman1">[15]</xref>. Linking bone and cardiovascular health, both ABD and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> were reported to increase the occurrence of vascular calcification (VC), known as a leading factor of mortality in CKD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Querfeld1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-London1">[16]</xref>. The risk for cardiovascular complications exhibits a biphasic curve, with highest risk involving vitamin D deficiency, uncontrolled hyperparathyroidism and high bone turnover, on one hand, and vitamin D-induced low PTH and ABD on the other hand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Querfeld1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Zittermann1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In attempt to understand the role of vitamin D in CKD-MBD state, several studies examined the effect of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> treatment on growth plate and bone development in renal failure animal models. Daily or intermittent treatment with 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> for a period of 4 weeks of 5/6 nephrectomized weanling rats with secondary hyperparathyroidism was shown to increase the markers of growth plate chondrocytes proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Sanchez3">[18]</xref>. Short-term treatment of uremic rats with 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> resulted in a reduced number of chondro-osseous junction chondroclasts compared to uremic control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Sanchez4">[19]</xref>. Examination of bone micro-architecture in nephrectomized growing rats revealed significantly altered bone parameters, including increased trabecular thickness, reduced cortical thickness and increased porosity, which were aggravated by daily administration of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Hopper1">[20]</xref>. Treatment with calcimimetic VDR analogues in a similar uremic rat model were also demonstrated to affect bone formation reducing osteoid surface and increasing bone resorption <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Finch1">[21]</xref>. Collectively, these studies suggest that active vitamin D influences growth plate and bone formation in the young skeleton and may contribute to the diminished growth in CKD-MBD children.</p>
      <p>At present, limited data is available on the direct effects of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> in bone tissue under physiological conditions, separate from renal insufficiency. In the current study we investigate the influence of continuous 1-week and intermittent 1-month administration of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> on growth plate and bone development in normal young rats.</p>

        <title>Animal experiments</title>
        <p>The studies were approved by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem Animal Care and Use Committee, Ethics number: AG-09-12147-2. Male Sprague-Dawly rats (75 g, 4 weeks old) were purchased from Harlen Labratories (Rehovot, Israel) and fed a normal chow diet. Two experimental schedules were performed, one week experiment and one month experiment. For a one week experiment rats were randomly allocated into two groups: (1) received i.p. injections of 2.4% (v/v) ethanol in saline vehicle, daily for 7 days (n = 6); (2) received i.p. injections of 1 µg/kg 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> in saline, daily for 7 days (n = 6). For a one month experiment: (1) received i.p. injections of 2.4% (v/v) ethanol in saline vehicle three times a week for 30 days (n = 6); (2) received i.p. injections of 3 µg/kg 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> in saline, three times a week for 30 days (n = 6). The total volume of injection was 100 µL per 100 mg of rat body weight. In the clinical settings, secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with moderate-to-severe CKD-MBD in pediatric patients is managed with doses reaching 0.025 µg/kg daily (The Merck Manual). We have chosen to administer about 40 times higher dose due the following reasons. First, both of our experiments were designed to span a considerably shorter time-frame, in comparison to chronic 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> treatment practiced in CKD-MBD patients, where drug and its effects may be accumulated over time. Second, during the allometric dose translation from animals to humans, in addition to body weight (BW), Km factor representing BW (kg) divided by body surface area (BSA, m<sup>2</sup>) of both species is commonly taken into account. BSA has been previously shown to correlate with several parameters including oxygen utilization, caloric expenditure, basal metabolism, blood volume, circulating plasma proteins, and renal function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-ReaganShaw1">[26]</xref>. Thus, according to the Food and Drug administration recommendations, dose given to rats should be about 6.2 times higher than dose given to humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-ReaganShaw1">[26]</xref>. To accommodate these two notions we decided to administer a dose higher than normally given to pediatric CKD-MBD patients, which in our view serves a better representation of the clinical picture. Both groups in one week experiment also received i.p. injections of mineral binding fluorochromes, 40 mg/kg calcein on day 2 and 20 mg/kg alizarin complexon on day 5. At the end of the experiment the animals were anesthetized by Isoflurane and killed by cervical dislocation. Tibiae were removed, decalcified and embedded in paraffin blocks for histological analysis, femurs were frozen at −20C° until subsequent micro-CT analysis.</p>

        <p>The region of proximal metaphysis to mid- diaphysis of all femurs , was scanned with a Skyscan 1174 X-ray computed microtomograph scanner (Skyscan, Aartselaar Belgium), equipped with a CCD detector. Images were obtained by 50 kV X-ray tube voltage and 800 µA current. Specimens from the 7-day calcitriol experiment were scanned using 0.25 mm aluminum filter, at 3500 ms exposure time, and at 13.8 pixel size resolution. For samples belonging to the 1-month calcitirol experiment 0.5 mm aluminum filter, 4000 ms exposure time and 13.8 pixel size resolution were used. For each specimen, a series of 900 projection images were obtained with a rotation step of 0.4°, averaging 2 frames, for a total 360° rotation. Flat field correction was performed at the beginning of each scan for a specific zoom and image format. A stack of 2D X-ray shadow projections was reconstructed to obtain images using NRecon software (Skyscan), and subjected to the morphometric analysis using CTAn software (Skyscan). During reconstruction, dynamic image range, post-alignment value, beam hardening and ring-artifact reduction were optimized for each experimental set. Analysis of the diaphyseal cortical region 200 slices, corresponding to 2.764 mm were chosen. Global greyscale threshold levels for the cortical region were between 100 and 255 were selected. For the trabecular region a total of 150 slices, corresponding to 2.073 mm were selected, and adaptive grayscale threshold levels between 40 (1-week experiment) and 60 (1-month experiment) to 255were used. Morphometric analysis was based on the 2-D and 3-D internal CTAn plug-ins. 3-D images (CTM file format) were constructed from cortical and trabecular regions of interest, utilizing Marching Cubes 33 algorithm in CTVol software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Reich2">[27]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Tibiae were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS at 4°C and subjected to 3 weeks of decalcification in 0.5 M EDTA, pH 7.4. Following dehydration in graded ethanol solutions and histoclear (Bar-Naor), tissue was embedded in Paraplast, cut into 5 µm sections and mounted on Superfrost slides (Thermo Scientific). For Safranin O staining, 0.1% Safranin O (Sigma) solution was used. Growth plate total width and areas width were measured using ImageJ software. For that, total growth plate was visually separated into two areas, based on morphological distinctions: 1. Proliferative zone, including columnar chondrocytes and intense orange (Safranin O stained) extracellular matrix; 2. Hypertrophic zone, including swollen mature, hypertrophic and terminally differentiated chondrocytes, characterized by low extracellular matrix volume. In each zone, 7 vertical (perpendicular to chondro-osseous junction) lines were drawn throughout the growth plate and width was calculated as an average of these 7 measurements. For immunohistochemistry, sections were deparaffinized in xylene and washed twice with ethanol. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Merck) in methanol for 30 min. Sections were rehydrated through a graded series of ethanol solutions, rinsed in PBS+T and blocked with 3% goat serum in PBS+T for 1 hr.

To assess whether pharmacological administration of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> influences bone formation in young rats with normal renal function we established two regiments where 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>, was administered to young rats for a period of one week or one month. 1-week and 1-month treatment with 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> induced vascular calcification, as evident by intense Alizarin Red staining of the aortae, compared to control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020772.s001">Fig S1A,B</xref>). Staining of tibiae with Safranin O (stain for cartilage) revealed marked reduction in the total growth plate width in both experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020772-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020772-g002">2A</xref>). Measurement of individual zones showed that this effect is attributed predominantly to the narrowing of the hypertrophic zone of the growth plate, since the proliferative zone width remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020772-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020772-g002">2B</xref>). Hypertrophic zone width was reduced by 47% after 1-week 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> treatment and 32% after 1-month treatment compared to the relevant controls. While continuous 1-week 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> administration did not significantly alter the morphological appearance of chondrocytes, intermittent 1-month treatment resulted in disordered chondrocyte morphology, noticeably disrupting the columnar organization of the growth plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020772-g002">Fig. 2A,E</xref>). Growth plate phenotypes were not manifested in significant tibial length differences (and final weight) between experimental groups, suggesting presence of compensating mechanisms which regulate longitudinal growth in this model.</p>

        <title>1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> induces chondrocytes proliferation and reduces the expression of hypertrophic chondrocyte markers</title>
        <p>Given the unchanged width of the proliferative zone, we subsequently tested whether 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> altered the number of proliferating cells. Both 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> treatment groups showed elevated ratio of PCNA positive cells out of the total population of proliferating cells, increasing by 107% after 1-week treatment, and by 131% after 1-month treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020772-g001">Fig. 1C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020772-g002">2C,D</xref>). The count of total proliferating cells did not significantly vary between groups. Narrowing of the growth plate may stem from a number of mechanisms including hindered or accelerated chondrocyte maturation, elevated apoptosis, enhanced chondroclastogenesis and osteogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Nilsson1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Karsenty1">[32]</xref>. To investigate this question, we fist examined the expression of several chondrocyte differentiation markers. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization (<italic>ISH</italic>) analysis using specific probes for aggrecan and collagen type II, major structural components of the growth plate cartilage, demonstrated their compressed distribution in the 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-treated groups compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020772-g001">Fig. 1E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020772-g002">2E,F</xref>). As aggrecan and collagen type II are normally expressed in all growth plate zones, excluding the terminally differentiated chondrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Sandell1">[33]</xref>, the effect observed is presumably due to the marked narrowing of the hypertrophic areas. Whereas 1-week 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> treatment showed equal intensities of aggrecan and collagen type II mRNA staining throughout the growth plate, 1-month 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> treatment resulted in weaker staining in the proliferative zone and more intense staining in the hypertrophic zone chondrocytes. In this regard, considering the observation of disrupted columnar organization it is plausible to assume that chondrogenesis is affected not only in the mature hypertrophic zone, but also in the earlier stages of chondrocyte proliferation during 1-month 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> treatment. We speculate that a combined notion of increased PCNA staining and delayed escalation in collagen type II, as well as aggrecan expression, points toward a 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-meidated disruption in the differentiation balance, favoring chondrocytes proliferation over maturation. <italic>ISH</italic> using probe for collagen type X, a specific marker for hypertrophic chondrocytes, supported these results, by showing a significantly reduced area of collagen type X expression in 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> –treated compared to control tibiae in both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020772-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020772-g002">2G</xref>).

TUNEL, labeling DNA strand nicks, showed that both 1-week and 1-month 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> treatment significantly increases the number of apoptotic cells in the hypertrophic zone compared to the respective control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020772-g001">Fig. 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020772-g002">2H</xref>).

Notably, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> triggered a significant reduction in bone volume over total volume (BV/TV) which fell to 7% lower than control during 1-month regimen. As BV/TV represents the relative ratio between bone and open space, the reduction BV/TV resulted in reciprocal 138% elevation in the percent cortical porosity (Ct.Po.) after 1-week (BV/TV of VD 96.9% compared to Ctr 98.6%) and 416% elevation after 1-month (BV/TV of VD 91.5% compared to Ctr 98.3%) 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020772-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020772-g005">5C</xref>).

        <p>1-week 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> administration triggered significant increases of 68% in BV/TV, 77% in trabecular number (Tb.N.), and 5% in trabecular thickness (Tb.Th.), while causing a corresponding 54% reduction in the trabecular separation (Tb.Sp.) compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020772-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>).

        <p>Micro-CT analysis of cortical mineral density (BMD) demonstrated significant 10±2% and 22±2% reduction during 1-week and 1-month 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> treatments respectively. In attempt to elucidate the reasons for 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-increased cortical porosity and reduced BMD, we monitored the dynamics of bone formation by injecting two fluorochromes, calcein and alizarin complexone at different time points, known to bind precipitated mineral. Confocal microscopy images showed progressive time dependent bone deposition (first green calcein and subsequently red alizarine complexone) leading to pore closure in the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020772-g006">Fig. 6A,B</xref>). 1-week treatment with 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> demonstrated markedly reduced fluorochrome staining, particularly surrounding pore area indicating hampered bone formation and thus reduced pore closure. Bone apposition at the periosteal side does not appear to be affected, supported by the unchanged T.Ar. values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020772-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020772-g005">5C</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>To our knowledge, the current study is the first to utilize 3D imaging for presenting differential effects of supraphysiological doses of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> on the trabecular and cortical bone architecture in healthy young rats. We have shown that both 1-week-continuous and 1-month-intermittent administration of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> results in significantly narrower growth plates, influencing chondrocytes proliferation, maturation and apoptosis. Alterations in growth plate morphology coincide with changes in bone architecture, transiently elevated trabecular bone and suppressed cortical bone formation, which exacerbated with prolonged 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> administration. Overall, our results suggest that high pharmacological doses of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> may directly hamper endochondral ossification and appositional bone development in the growing skeleton.</p>
      <p>Longitudinal bone growth is largely dependent on the cartilaginous growth plates, where chondrocytes proliferate in a columnar manner, hypertrophy and undergo subsequent replacement by primary spongiosa, constituting mineralized trabecular bone. Any condition or interruption of this orderly transition can lead to bone deformities and decline the growth potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Nilsson1">[31]</xref>. Children and animals with vitamin D deficiency or VDR mutations have expanded growth plates, known as rickets, which are largely corrected by high calcium diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Bouillon1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Donohue1">[3]</xref>. Aberrant growth plate, however, appears before the onset of hypocalcemia in VDR-deficient mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Li1">[34]</xref>, supporting a defined role for 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> in the process of endochondral bone formation. Recent literature supports both systemic (mineral homeostasis centered) and local (VDR-mediated activity in chondrocytes and osteoblasts) of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>. Whereas most studies examine the effect of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> in transgenic models or in conjunction with either nephrectomy or ovariectomy, we tested the effect of pharmacological 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> administration on growth plate development under normal physiological conditions. Our observations of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>–mediated compression of hypertrophic chondrocytes, are in line with the data from VDR or 1α-hydroxylase deficient animals, where hypertrophic chondrocyte zone spreads in a rickets-like manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Donohue1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Dardenne2">[35]</xref>. Moreover, the restricted chondrocytes hypertrophy associated with TUNEL-detected apoptotic death in our models correlates with the above studies, where growth plate expansion was reported to be secondary to the decreased apoptosis. Although, the width of the proliferative layer was not altered, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> treatment caused an increase in the number of the proliferative cells both <italic>in vivo</italic> and in the ATDC5 chondrocytic cell line <italic>in vitro</italic>. On the other hand, analysis of maturation markers, including Collagen type II and X, revealed down-regulation by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> in the ATDC5 and compressed expression in the rat growth plates. In this regard, a collection of <italic>in-vitro</italic> findings previously showed differential effect of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> on the proliferation and differentiation of a variety of chondrocytic cell types, where the responsiveness depends on the state of maturation, dose and the time course of treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Nilsson1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Anderson1">[36]</xref>. A study in uremic rats also showed that both daily and intermittent calcitriol therapy actively enhance markers of chondrocyte proliferation (cyclin D, histone-4, mTOR) and the expression of the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor-3 (FGFR3), a known chondrogenesis inhibitor localized to the hypertrophic zone, compared to the nephrectomized control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Sanchez3">[18]</xref>. In contrast to our observations, however, the same study reported higher expression level of VDR, Calcium Receptor (CaR), Fibroblast Growth Factor-23 (FGF-23) associated with hypertrophic chondrocytes. This discrepancy could possibly arise from the important role VDR, CaR and FGF-23 play in the maintenance of calcium and phosphorus homeostasis which is strongly perturbed in the model of renal failure. Overall, we speculate that our observations result from the direct stimulatory influence of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> on chondrocyte proliferation, and either an inhibitory influence on chondrocyte maturation or induction of the neighboring bone-residing osteoblasts to dominate the process of osteogenesis over chondrogenesis.</p>
      <p>In attempt to translate the altered proliferation and differentiation from the level of growth plate to the level of bone modeling, we subjected bones to micro-CT analysis. By comparison, 1-week 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> administration resulted in trabecular bone state analogous to the three weeks older, 1-month control group. Despite similar growth plate phenotype, 1-month 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> administration did not further enhance trabecular bone development, possibly due to additional mechanisms controlling bone growth capacity. Such anabolic effects of active vitamin D were previously reported following 13 day infusion of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> to adult rats, manifested by increased trabecular osteoid mass. Moreover, in accordance with our data, histomorphometric analysis showed significantly reduced number of surface osteoclasts, suggesting lower bone resorption of the newly formed bone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Wronski1">[37]</xref>. Additional study where high dose of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> was given to adult female rats resulted in augmented osteoblast recruitment and performance, reduced osteoclast number and stimulated trabecular bone remodeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Erben1">[38]</xref>. Interestingly, VDR−/−, 1α-hydroxylase−/− or double mutant mice on rescue diet show reduced bone formation below wild-type, which is corrected by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>, indicating physiological anabolic role for the endogenous 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> mediated by VDR <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Xue1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Panda1">[40]</xref>. Although, not tested here, the inhibitory effects of calcitriol on TRAP-positive osteoclast and chondroclast invasion may involve a mechanism of suppressed PTH release, well associated with bone resorption. Alternatively, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> may directly influence osteoclasts, since <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies reported a calcitriol VDR-mediated suppression of osteoclast differentiation from precursor cells, dependent on c-Fos protein reduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Takasu1">[41]</xref>. Additional supporting evidence relates to the impaired chondrocytes activity, which was previously shown to locally regulate osteoclastogenesis during bone formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Masuyama1">[7]</xref>. Collectively, our results suggest that 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-mediated increase in chondrocyte proliferation together with compressed maturation and enhanced apoptosis, indicate accelerated process of growth plate transition which ultimately results in increased osteogenesis.</p>
      <p>A particularly interesting observation came from the analysis of cortical bone which in contrast to trabecular bone, portrayed a reduced osteogenesis profile, in terms of both architecture and mineral content. Separate from the longitudinal bone growth, appositional bone growth relies on the process of modeling where endosteal osteoclast resorb inner cortex surface and periosteal osteoblasts deposit and mineralize primary bone matrix on the outer perimeter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Schoenau1">[42]</xref>. Our results demonstrated that continuous or intermittent treatment with 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> reduce cortical modeling, leaving bones 14% and 45% thinner after 1-week and 1-month treatment respectively. Increased medullar area in conjunction with normal cortical perimeter point toward uncoupled bone formation and resorption, plausibly stemming from enhanced osteoclastic activity at the endosteal surface. Previous work demonstrated that pharmacological, but not physiological doses of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> markedly increase RANKL expression by osteoblast, stimulating cortical osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption in rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Suda1">[43]</xref>. Moreover, daily calcitriol injection in uremic rats was reported to result in lower cortical thickness, compared to nephrectomized control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Hopper1">[20]</xref>. These data partially support the fact that cortical bone is affected more dramatically during renal failure than trabecular bone, in the pediatric patients on peritoneal dialysis and calcitriol therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Sanchez1">[9]</xref>. Inside the cortex, the coupling between osteoblast and osteoclast activity is manifested in the presence of cortical pores which provide conduits for the passage of neurovascular structures. Cortical porosity is considered to be closely associated with mechanical properties of cortical bone, influencing bone strength and risk of fracture. We showed that 1-week 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> administration dramatically augmented the volume and number of cortical pores, which exacerbated to over 4 fold higher percent cortical porosity in relation to control upon 1-month administration. Since larger medular cavity implies enhanced osteoclast presence, we speculate that elevated bone resoprtion, either alone or in combination with suppressed osteoblast function, accounts for higher porosity. A recent notion of two distinct osteoblast types situated in the cortical bone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Shapiro1">[44]</xref>, raises another possibility, whereby 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> selectively suppresses the intracortical osteoblasts lining primary osteons, without affecting surface mesenchymal osteoblasts lining the periosteum. Finally, analysis of mineral binding flurochromes demonstrated that administration of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> dramatically hampered intracortical collagen matrix deposition and mineralization leading to the deficient filling of pores. Previous literature reports using classical 2D histomorphometric methods show inhibitory effect of pharmacological dose of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> on cortical bone remodeling in ribs of adult dogs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-High1">[45]</xref> and impaired mineralization in adult rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Wronski1">[37]</xref>. Our observations suggest that although osteoblast-dependent radial cortical growth was not affected, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> augmented endosteal osteolclast activity and largely disturbed intracortical bone remodeling and mineralization.</p>
      <p>To offset the 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-related ABD and cardiovascular components of CKD, novel less hypercalcemic analogues of vitamin D, including paricalcitol and doxercalciferol, have already been available for use in adult patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020772-Wesseling1">[10]</xref>. In light of the significant adverse effects of calcitriol, search for alternative treatments in CKD-MBD which ensure optimal growth plate physiology and resolution of secondary hyperparathyroidism without the burden of systemic vasculopathy are in place.</p>
