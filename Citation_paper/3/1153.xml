<abstract>
<p>Methylophiopogonanone A (MO-A), an active homoisoflavonoid of the Chinese herb <italic>Ophiopogon japonicus</italic> which has been shown to have protective effects on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, has been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. However, little is known about its role in cerebral I/R injury. Therefore, in this study, by using a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and reperfusion rat model, the effect of MO-A on cerebral I/R injury was examined. The results showed that MO-A treatment reduced infarct volume and brain edema, improved neurological deficit scores, reversed animal body weight decreases, and increased animal survival time in the stroke groups. Western blotting showed that MO-A suppressed MMP-9, but restored the expression of claudin-3 and claudin-5. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy were monitored to determine the blood–brain barrier (BBB) alterations <italic>in vitro</italic>. The results showed that MO-A markedly attenuated BBB damage <italic>in vitro</italic>. Additionally, MO-A inhibited ROS production in ECs and MMP-9 release in differentiated THP-1 cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, and suppressed ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression in ECs and leukocyte/EC adhesion. In conclusion, our data indicate that MO-A has therapeutic potential against cerebral I/R injury through its ability to attenuate BBB disruption by regulating the expression of MMP-9 and tight junction proteins.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ischemic stroke, a complex devastating disease, is caused by drastic disruption of cerebral blood flow, resulting in a deficiency of glucose and oxygen and triggering a multi-step pathophysiological ischemic cascade. Disruption of the blood—brain barrier (BBB) and successive brain edema formation are two of the basic pathological changes in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Focal cerebral ischemia induces BBB integrity loss, which allows intravascular fluid and proteins to penetrate into the cerebral extracellular space, thereby incurring vasogenic edema formation and further brain damage [<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The BBB is a highly selective permeability barrier to separate the circulating blood from the brain extracellular fluid and to maintain the micro-environment of brain, which being formed of endothelial cells, pericytes, astrocytes, neurons, and the extracellular matrix [<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Considerable evidence indicates that I/R oxidative stress can cause BBB disruption and increase cerebral vascular permeability, which then leads to the formation of brain edema, which aggravates cerebral infarction [<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A sudden supply of molecular oxygen after reperfusion subsequently produces excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) via electron transport within mitochondria in brain tissue. ROS then activates enzymes and signal cascades such as lipids and chromatin, activating matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), changing tight junction proteins, and eventually resulting in BBB dysfunction [<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124558.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, protection of the BBB can thus be seen as an aspect of stroke management, by rescuing the neurovascular unit.</p>
<p>Quite a few neuroprotective agents with moderate efficacy in stroke management have been reported. However, the treatment of stroke remains considerably unsatisfactory as the performance of almost all neuroprotective agents in the clinical treatment of patients with stroke has been disappointing [<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Recent attention has focused on a series of natural products shown to protect against cerebral I/R injury. The dried tuber root of <italic>Ophiopogon japonicus</italic> (L.f) Ker-Gawl from <italic>Ophiopogon japonicus plants</italic>, which commonly being classified into Chuanmaidong and Zhemaidong according to its mainly producing areas of Sichuan and Zhejiang provinces in China, is one of the commonly traditional Chinese medicine in clinic, being used for the treatment of myocardial ischemia and thrombosis, remedying hypoxia, delaying senility and reducing blood sugar etc. for thousands of years [<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It has been reported that a Chinese patent drug consisting of <italic>Ophiopogon japonicus</italic> (Shengmai San) might significantly protect the brain against I/R injury [<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The main chemical constitutes of <italic>Ophiopogon japonicus</italic> involve steroidal sapogenins and homoisoflavonoids [<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A major steroidal sapogenin of <italic>Ophiopogon japonicus</italic> (Ruscogenin) has been shown to prevent cerebral I/R injury [<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], however, little is known about homoisoflavonoids of <italic>Ophiopogon japonicus</italic>. Methylophiopogonanone A (MO-A; <xref rid="pone.0124558.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) is one of the major isoflavonoid present in <italic>Ophiopogon japonicus</italic>. Previous pharmacological investigations have revealed that both MO-A has anti-oxdative [<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124558.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and anti-inflammatory properties [<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, there are no reports about the effect of MO-A on cerebral I/R injury.</p>

<p>Therefore, in this study, rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of BBB dysfunction were used to examine the therapeutic potential of MO-A on stroke prevention. Additionally, we assessed whether these cerebral protective effects were associated with inhibition of BBB disruption via regulating MMP-9 and claudin protein expression.</p>

<title>Transient Focal Cerebral Ischemia in the Rat</title>
<p>The experimental protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal Experimentation of Capital Medical University (Beijing, China) and conformed to internationally accepted ethical standards. Sprague-Dawley rats (Male, 280–320g weights) were supplied by the Vital River Laboratories (Beijing, China) and housed under controlled conditions with a 12-hour light/dark cycle, at a temperature of 21°C ± 2°C, and humidity of 60 ± 5% for at least 1 week before experimentation. The rats were allowed free access to a standard rodent diet and tap water.</p>
<p>MCAO was induced using the intraluminal suture method [<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124558.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Briefly, rats were anesthetized using chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg), which shown advantages of fast absorption, short excited periods and long periods of anesthesia (1–3 hours), while its possible side effects, such as strong irritant to local tissues, inhibitation of themoregulatory center and arrhythmia, should be caution; a 2.0-cm skin incision was made in the ventral neck muscles, and a 3–0 MCAO monofilament (Sunbio Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) was advanced to block the origin of the MCA. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was monitored using a laser Doppler computerized main unit (Perimed AB, Sweden). Successful establishment of MCAO was determined when rCBF decreased to 20% of baseline levels before ischemia; otherwise, animals were excluded. Reperfusion was performed by withdrawing the monofilament after 120 minutes ischemia, and then the wound was closed. During the surgery and reperfusion, rectal temperature was maintained at 37 ± 0.5°C by means of a heating blanket. Rats were examined once every 3 hours at day 1 and once every 12 hours at day 2 to day 7. “Low mobility” and “animals incapable of feeding” were used as humane endpoints. The mortality rate of the MCAO model was around 15%, while about 9% in the young rats and 43.5% in the aged rats [<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A similar procedure without MCAO was conducted in control rats.</p>

<sec id="sec004">
<title>Drug Treatments</title>
<p>To evaluate the neuroprotective effect of MO-A (purity &gt; 98%; Ronghe Technology Co., LTD, Shanghai, China, and was dissolved in normal saline with PH = 8.0), except for sham operation rats (Control), MCAO rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: MCAO with vehicle (model), and MCAO treated with 1.25, 2.50 or 5.00 mg/kg MO-A twice per day. After 2 h reperfusion, the rats were treated intravenously with MO-A for 7 days. Control rats were treated with equal volumes of saline.</p>

<sec id="sec005">
<title>Neurological Deficit Evaluation</title>
<p>Neurological function was evaluated blindly as described previously [<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] at 6 hours, 1, 3 and 7 days after reperfusion. On a five-point scale (grade 0: showing no observable deficit; Grade 1: a failure to fully extend left forepaw; Grade 2: circling to the left; Grade 3: falling to the left; Grade 4: no walking spontaneously and having a depressed level of consciousness). The evaluation was performed by an observer who was blind to the group.</p>

<sec id="sec006">
<title>Infarct Volume Measurement</title>
<p>On day 7 after MCAO, animals were euthanized and sacrifices by decapitation, and the brains were collected. Brains were sliced into 7 coronal sections at 2-mm thickness each and stained with 2% (w/v) 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) in saline at 37°C for 30 minutes, and then fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde [<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124558.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Afere 24 hours, slices were scanned and images were analyzed with Image J 1.42q software (National Institutes of Health, USA), the normal tissue was stained with a deep red while a pale gray color in the infarct area, infarct volumes was expressed as percentage of the two fold of the contralateral hemisphere.</p>

<sec id="sec007">
<title>Brain Water Content Determination</title>
<p>Animals were anesthetized and sacrificed by decapitation after reperfusion at 3 days. The brains were quickly removed and weighed to obtain the wet weight, and dried at 100°C for 24 h and weighed to obtain the brain water content. The formula for calculating water content was as follows: water content (%) = (wet weight − dry weight) / wet weight ×100.</p>

<sec id="sec008">
<title>Western Blotting</title>
<p>Protein was extracted from the cortex according to a previously described procedure [<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Membranes were probed with primary antibodies against claudin-3, claudin-5 (1:1000, Millipore, USA) and MMP-9 (1:1000, Cell signaling, USA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies were used and visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Thermo Scientific, USA). The density of each band was quantified with Image J 1.42q software (National Institutes of Health, USA). β-actin (1:5000, Abmart, China) was used as a loading control.</p>

<p>After reperfusion, neurological scores were measured at 6 hours, 24 hours, 3 days and 7 days (<xref rid="pone.0124558.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>), and animal body weights were measured at day 1, 3 and 7 (<xref rid="pone.0124558.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). The results showed that neurological scores of MCAO animals with MO-A treatment at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg and 5.0 mg/kg were significantly decreased when compared with the model group (P &lt; 0.05 or 0.01). Additionally, the decrease in animal body weights was significantly reversed with MO-A (5.0 mg/kg) treatment (P &lt; 0.01).</p>
<p>Furthermore, animal survival time was also observed to evaluate the protective effects of MO-A in MCAO rats. Although no significant differences were observed, the results showed that the survival time of MCAO animals with MO-A treatment (127.8 ± 66.7, 136.0 ± 57.2 and 141.8 ± 46.1 hours of 1.25, 2.50 or 5.00 mg/kg dosage treatment, respectly) increased when compared with the model group (107.9 ± 80.3 hours) (<xref rid="pone.0124558.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, To investigate the protective effects of MO-A on BBB disruption under hypoxic conditions, the brain water contents in MCAO rats were measured. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0124558.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>, cerebral water contents were less in the MO-A (2.5 mg/kg and 5.0 mg/kg) treatment groups than those in the model group (P &lt; 0.05).</p>

<title>Discussions</title>
<p>MCAO rats, when administered with MO-A at 2.50 and 5.00 mg/kg intravenously twice per day, had significantly reduced infarct volumes following TTC staining, and significantly alleviated the neurological deficits and body weight loss of the rats with MCAO, which indicating that the less histological damage was observed after MO-A treatment. It suggests that MO-A has significant therapeutic potential on brain ischemic injury.</p>
<p>Mechanical or hypoxic damage of vascular endothelium, toxic damage of excitotoxic amino acids (especially glutamate), inflammatory molecules and free radicals, and destruction of the basal lamina by matrix metalloproteinases are potential causes of BBB disruption, which leads to vasogenic edema, influx of toxic substances and inflammation after stroke [<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Vasogenic edema, being distinct from cytotoxic edema, occurs due to a breakdown of the tight endothelial junctions that make up the blood–brain barrier, which allows intravascular proteins and fluid to penetrate into the parenchymal extracellular space [<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In the present study, we demonstrated that MO-A reduced water content after reperfusion when compared with the model group, which suggested that MO-A had a protective effect on ischemic brain edema. We also demonstrated that I/R impaired BBB permeability BBB while MO-A treatment restored BBB integrity following hypoxic BBB damage <italic>in vitro</italic>. This result indicates that the protective effect of MO-A on brain ischemic injury involves its ability to attenuate BBB disruption <italic>in vitro</italic> and brain vasogenic edema.</p>
<p>Brain capillary endothelial cells expressing tight junction proteins are the major structural constituents of the BBB [<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Degradation of the critical tight junction proteins claudin-3 and claudin-5 is involved in BBB breakdown and a pathological hallmark of acute ischemic stroke [<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124558.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This degradation of tight junction proteins was involved in triggering numerous molecular cascades that suppress MCAO-induced over expression of MMP-9 [<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124558.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. MMP-9 has been extensively studied for its involvement in BBB disruption after stroke [<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It has been reported that MMP-9 knockout mice are resistant to BBB disruption induced by transient focal cerebral ischemia [<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Accordingly, in this study, we observed robust upregulation of MMP-9 in the brain after transient MCAO, which was significantly decreased with MO-A treatment. We also found that I/R altered the expression of tight junction proteins (claudin-3 and claudin-5), while MO-A treatment normalized their expression. These results suggest that the protective effect of MO-A on BBB disruption may associated with the inhibition of MMP-9 and regulation of tight junction proteins.</p>
<p>MMP-9 over expression has been shown to be strongly associated with oxygen radicals [<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Reactive oxygen species, as a consequence of focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion, are produced under ischemic conditions and during the inflammatory response after ischemia [<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], which react irreversibly with several cellular constituents and damage virtually any cellular component [<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Oxygen radicals serve as important signaling molecules in the pathophysiology of BBB damage and ischemic stroke [<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Oxygen radicals not only triggers the activation of MMP-9 in brain I/R injury [<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], but also elicits an inflammatory response and plays a key role in the induction of cell adhesion molecules [<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Several studies have shown that cerebral infarction induced by transient MCAO is significantly reduced when leukocyte adhesion to ECs is inhibited [<xref rid="pone.0124558.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124558.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In this study, we found that treatment with MO-A may significantly abolish the increase of ROS and the level of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in OGD/R bEnd.3 cells, followed by marked inhibition of the adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells in the presence of TNF-α and IL-1β. Additionally, MMP-9 release in PMA differentiated THP-1 cells was also significantly prevented with MO-A treatment. These results suggest that the inhibition of MMP-9 release and leukocyte adhesion to ECs may be associated with the inhibition of ROS increase.</p>
<p>Collectively, these data clearly indicate that the protective effect of MO-A on cerebral I/R injury partly involves its ability to attenuate BBB disruption <italic>in vitro</italic> and brain edema. The potential mechanism of this BBB disruption attenuation following MO-A treatment may be associated with the regulation of tight junction proteins and MMP-9, which is likely to be mediated by attenuating oxidative stress, and the resultant inhibition of leukocyte and EC inhibition.</p>
