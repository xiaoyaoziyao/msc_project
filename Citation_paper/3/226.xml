<title>Aim</title>
<p>Although the atheroprotective effects of statins and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are well-established, little is known about their additive effects, especially during the early period of atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether combination of a statin and an ARB exerts synergistic anti-atherosclerotic effects, and to elucidate the mechanisms of combined effects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Atherosclerotic plaques were developed in arteries of 23 rabbits using a high-cholesterol diet (HCD) and intra-arterial balloon inflation. Rabbits received one of five different treatment strategies for 4 weeks: positive control [n = 5, HCD]; negative control [n = 3, regular chow diet]; statin [n = 5, HCD and rosuvastatin 10 mg]; ARB [n = 5, HCD and olmesartan 20 mg]; and combination [n = 5, HCD and statin+ARB].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Histological analysis demonstrated that development of atherosclerotic plaques was inhibited more in combination group than in statin group (P = 0.001). Although macrophage infiltration identified by RAM11 staining was not significantly different between combination and individual treatment groups (31.76±4.84% [combination] vs. 38.11±6.53% [statin; P = 0.35] or 35.14±2.87% [ARB; P = 0.62]), the relative proportion of pro-inflammatory M1-macrophages was significantly lower in combination group than in ARB group (3.20±0.47% vs. 5.20±0.78%, P = 0.02). Furthermore, M2-macrophage polarization was higher in combination group than in statin group (17.70±3.04% vs. 7.86±0.68%, P = 0.001).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec004">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Combination treatment with a statin and an ARB produced synergistic protective effects for atherosclerosis initiation and progression, which may be attributed to modulation of macrophage characteristics in the early period of atherosclerosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref001">1</xref>]. They are primarily caused by atherosclerosis, a composite of complex inflammatory and immunologic responses resulting in atheromatous plaques within the lining of arteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref004">4</xref>]. Following lipid accumulation, robust inflammatory responses occur within the intima, producing endothelial injury and dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref003">3</xref>]. During these inflammatory processes, subsets of monocytes play substantial roles in the progression of atherosclerosis and evolve into various phenotypes of macrophages, promoting or inhibiting plaque development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref005">5</xref>]. Macrophages involved in the progression of atherosclerosis have different effects on atherosclerosis, according to their polarity. While pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1-type) are usually enriched in progressing plaques, M2-macrophages, which promote tissue repair, are more enriched in regressing plaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Statins are the first-line pharmacological treatment for preventing atherosclerotic plaque progression. Furthermore, statins can stabilize and even induce regression of atherosclerotic plaques through their pleotropic effects, including anti-inflammatory activity as well as lipid-lowering effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref008">8</xref>]. However, beneficial effects of statins on suppressing initiation and progression of atherosclerosis before definite plaque development, termed the early period, are not well elucidated.</p>
<p>Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) exert their cardioprotective and atheroprotective effects by directly inhibiting the effects of angiotensin-renin-aldosterone system on arteries, as well as by reducing blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref010">10</xref>]. As with statins, the protective effects of ARB in the early period of atherosclerosis are not well understood, especially with respect to vascular inflammation.</p>
<p>Given that combined treatment with statins and ARBs is extremely common in clinical practice, as most patients with CVD also have dyslipidemia and/or hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref012">12</xref>], we investigated whether statins and ARBs possess synergistic effects in preventing the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. To determine whether these drugs have specific anti-atherosclerotic effects, rather than indirect effects related to risk factor modification, we focused on initial effects after drug administration.</p>

<p>Rabbits were anesthetized with intravascular injections of Alfaxan (0.2 mg/kg, Careside, Seongnam, Korea) and xylazine (0.5 mg/kg, Rompun, Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany). Anesthesia was maintained with 1.5% isoflurane (Forane, JW Pharm, Seoul, Korea) and oxygen. Surgical access was achieved via the left carotid artery, through which a 6 F sheath was inserted. Heparin 600 IU was injected before catheterization. Angiography was performed of the aorta and iliac arteries, followed by over-inflation of the balloon at a balloon:artery ratio of 1.2:1.0 for two 30-s intervals. Inflation was performed in each arterial segment. Catheters were subsequently removed, and the left carotid artery was ligated.

<title>Immunohistochemical staining to assess inflammatory responses to drug treatment</title>
<p>To clarify the mechanisms whereby statins and ARBs synergistically suppress atherosclerosis progression, we further investigated the atherosclerotic plaques in rabbit vessels by IHC staining. Given that macrophages play a central role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, we investigated whether statins and ARBs synergistically affect macrophage characteristics. Plaque macrophage content, detected by staining for anti-rabbit macrophage clone RAM11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215604.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), was significantly less in combination group than in positive control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215604.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The inflammatory content of plaques, detected by staining for TNF-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215604.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), tended to be less in combination group than in other groups, although the differences were not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215604.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). We also used IHC to evaluate markers for macrophages observed in advanced plaques, such as CD163 (receptor of hemoglobin/haptoglobin complex) and CD206 (macrophage mannose receptor). Levels of these markers did not differ significantly between treatment groups: CD163, 32.92±4.05% in combination group vs. 36.94±1.43% in statin group (p = 0.40) and 38.86±3.77% in ARB group (p = 0.22) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215604.g003">Fig 3E and 3F</xref>); and CD206, 35.70±4.11% in combination group vs. 44.54±3.23% in statin group (p = 0.06) and 39.14±2.81% in ARB group (p = 0.47) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215604.g003">Fig 3G and 3H</xref>).

<p>This study demonstrated that the combination of a statin and an ARB synergistically exerts early anti-atherosclerotic effects, compared to administration of each drug separately.

<p>In the current study, we used an HCD-induced atherosclerosis rabbit model, which has been widely used to study the effects of drugs on atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref019">19</xref>]. To evaluate acute anti-atherosclerotic effects of these drugs, rather than their well-known chronic anti-atherosclerotic effects secondary to risk factor modification, drugs were administered immediately after initiation of HCD. Under our experimental conditions, statin and/or ARB treatment did not significantly reduce serum cholesterol levels. Nevertheless, our histological analysis showed a significant decrease in atheromatous plaque ratio after statin and/or ARB treatment. These observations suggest that the combination of these drugs exhibits acute anti-arteriosclerotic effects, even before the onset of risk factor effects. In addition, imaging analyses of coronary arteries using OCT and angiography demonstrated that plaque %AS was reduced by combination treatment with a statin and an ARB. Consistent with the plaque-stabilizing effects of statins and ARBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref021">21</xref>], we confirmed the synergistic effects of these drugs on plaque characteristics by histomorphological analysis. Lipid deposition, confirmed by Oil Red O staining, was markedly decreased in combination treatment group. Furthermore, collagen accumulation and smooth muscle cell proliferation was less with combination treatment. Further, mRNA and protein expression of TNF-α, one of the most potent pro-inflammatory cytokines, which exacerbates plaque progression and induces rupture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref022">22</xref>], was also lowest in combination treatment group. Taken together, these results suggest that combination treatment results in synergistic stabilization effects in atherosclerotic plaques.</p>
<p>A previous report demonstrated that a statin plus ARB markedly reduced atherosclerotic plaque lesion area by reducing RAM11 macrophage content of vascular plaques in hyperlipidemic rabbits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref023">23</xref>]. Similarly, our IHC data showed that macrophage area, as identified by RAM11 staining, was the lowest in combined group compared to other groups. These results led us to further investigate the effects of statins and ARBs on macrophage characteristics. Macrophage balance between M1/M2 polarization is known to play an important role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerotic plaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref024">24</xref>]. It has been suggested that highly-inflammatory Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes evolve into M1-macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions, which predominate in advanced vulnerable plaques and play an important role in plaque pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref007">7</xref>]. Conversely, M2-macrophages are associated with plaque stability because of their location within the human plaque and their intrinsic anti-inflammatory properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref024">24</xref>]. Further, macrophages observed near the necrotic lipid plaque core have reduced expression of Arg-1, a representative M2-macrophage marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref025">25</xref>]. In the current study, immunofluorescence staining for either M1-macrophage marker (iNOS) or M2-macrophage marker (Arg-1) demonstrated that combination treatment synergistically decreased iNOS area compared to ARB treatment, and increased Arg-1 area compared to statin treatment. In addition, areas of macrophages expressing CD163 or CD206, which are frequently observed in high-risk plaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref027">27</xref>], were lower in combination treatment group than in monotherapy groups, indicating that combination treatment with a statin and an ARB synergistically affects macrophage polarization, and thereby may exert beneficial effects on plaque stability. Mechanistically, both statin and ARB treatment alone showed a trend toward suppressing M1 polarization of macrophages, whereas ARB treatment alone increased M2-macrophage polarization, resulting in favorable macrophage polarization.</p>
<p>Along with favorable macrophage polarization, combined administration of statin and ARB reduced expression of receptors for these drugs. Previous reports have shown that statins down-regulate AGTR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref029">29</xref>] and inhibit HMG CoA reductase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref030">30</xref>]. Indeed, AGTR1 expression was slightly decreased by statin treatment alone, and combination drug treatment synergistically decreased AGTR1 mRNA expression. Koga and colleagues have nicely shown that AGTR1 on vascular wall cells, not bone marrow hematopoietic cells, plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by up-regulating the expression of adhesion molecules, thus inducing monocyte recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref031">31</xref>]. This interesting result supports our claim that ARB may directly contribute to the suppression of atherosclerosis initiation and progression, as well as blood pressure reduction. Furthermore, HMC CoA reductase mRNA expression was further suppressed by combined administration of statin and ARB, compared with statin alone, which was possibly attributable to the pleiotropic effects of ARBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref032">32</xref>]. Using genetically modified mice, Sakai and colleagues have shown that HMG CoA reductase contributes to atherosclerosis by promoting migratory activity of monocytes/macrophage into atherosclerotic plaques through regulating the expression of small GTPase proteins, such as RhoA (RAS homolog family member A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215604.ref033">33</xref>]. This interesting finding that highlighted the central role of HMG CoA reductase in atherosclerosis, again supports our finding that statin and ARB synergistically suppresses atherosclerosis by suppressing HMG CoA reductase expression.</p>
<p>The main limitation of this study was its short experimental period, which resulted in negligible lipid-lowering effects. However, this allowed us to specifically assess the initial effects of treatment with a statin and an ARB. Also, a limited number of rabbits were available for this study, which prohibited statistical significance from being achieved in some experiments. Nevertheless, distinct trends were observed supporting the synergistic effects of statins and ARBs.</p>
<p>In conclusion, combined administration of a statin and an ARB exerted synergistic acute anti-atherosclerotic effects by reducing plaque burden, as confirmed by live-imaging analyses, as well as histological analyses. Mechanistically, co-administration of these agents polarized macrophages toward more reparative M2-macrophages, potentially leading to atherosclerosis suppression. These findings suggest that, in patients with coronary artery disease in a clinical setting, initiating concomitant administration of the two drugs at disease onset may lead to superior clinical outcomes.</p>
