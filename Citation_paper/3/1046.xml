<abstract>
<p>Neuroinflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of a range of brain disorders. Non-invasive imaging of neuroinflammation is critical to help improve our understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms, monitor therapies and guide drug development. Generally, MRI lacks specificity to molecular imaging biomarkers, but molecular MR imaging based on chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) can potentially detect changes of myoinositol, a putative glial marker that may index neuroinflammation. In this pilot study we aimed to investigate, through validation with immunohistochemistry and <italic>in vivo</italic> magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), whether CEST imaging can reflect the microglial response to a mild inflammatory challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), in the APPSwe/ PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease and wild type controls. The response to the immune challenge was variable and did not align with genotype. Animals with a strong response to LPS (Iba1+, n = 6) showed an increase in CEST contrast compared with those who did not (Iba1-, n = 6). Changes of myoinositol levels after LPS were not significant. We discuss the difficulties of this mild inflammatory model, the role of myoinositol as a glial biomarker, and the technical challenges of CEST imaging at 0.6ppm.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neuroinflammation is a potential factor in a range of neurodegenerative diseases, including stroke, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref003">3</xref>]. Microglia, key mediators of the CNS response to an inflammatory stimulus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref004">4</xref>], react to pathological insults by undergoing a transformation towards an activated state, changing morphology, accumulating at the site of the inflammatory insult, and triggering the cascade of molecular events that characterizes neuroinflammation. In the healthy brain, this process is finely regulated, but in pre-existing neurodegenerative conditions the microglial response can exacerbate disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref006">6</xref>]. Therefore, glial activation and neuroinflammation are potentially key modifiable mechanisms for different neurodegenerative disorders.</p>
<p>Non-invasive imaging biomarkers are important tools for the development of potential new treatments and for monitoring therapeutic effects. Radiolabeled ligands for positron emission tomography (PET) based on the upregulation of the translocator protein 18kDa (TSPO) have been shown to allow detection and monitoring of neuroinflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref008">8</xref>]. Due to its versatility, absence of ionizing radiation and routine clinical use, MRI would be a particularly attractive modality to complement PET to image neuroinflammation non-invasively. To date, however, MR imaging is generally not sensitive enough to monitor molecular markers of neuroinflammation.</p>
<p>MR spectroscopy on the other hand allows to measure a range of metabolites that have been linked to glial activation and neuroinflammation, including creatine, choline, glutamate, and myoinositol (mI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref011">11</xref>]. But the spatial resolution of MR spectroscopy is poor, and an MR imaging approach that retains spatially resolved molecular information indicative of neuroinflammation would be highly valuable. One way of overcoming the limitation of MR spectroscopy while to a degree retaining its specificity is to use chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST), where proton exchange between low-concentration molecules—below the detection threshold of standard MRI—containing hydroxyl (-OH), amine (-NH<sub>2</sub>), or amide groups with the abundant water protons amplifies the signal of a target molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref012">12</xref>]. Several studies have explored the possibility of imaging a neuroinflammatory response with CEST MRI, focusing on strong inflammatory stimuli or inflammation in late stages of disease. A reduction in CEST contrast at 3 ppm (attributed predominantly to glutamate changes and hence named GluCEST) was seen to correlate with a decrease in glutamate levels in 18–20 month old animal models of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref013">13</xref>]. Similar changes in the GluCEST signal have been demonstrated in a model of astrocyte activation (overexpression of the cytokine ciliary neurotrophic factor, CNTF, a strong activator of astrocytes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref014">14</xref>]. A reduced GluCEST signal has also been reported in a 20-month old mouse model of tauopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref015">15</xref>], in a 12-month old mouse model of Huntington disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref016">16</xref>] and in patients on the psychosis spectrum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref017">17</xref>], while increased gluCEST signal was observed in a mouse model of dopamine deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>Myoinositol is primarily found in glial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref009">9</xref>] and has therefore been proposed as a marker for microglial activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref019">19</xref>]. An increase in myoinositol levels in MR spectroscopy studies could be explained by a microglial proliferation observed in the neuroinflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref022">22</xref>]. Myoinositol is suitable for detection with CEST, because its six hydroxyl protons exchange with bulk water at a rate of k = 600 s<sup>−1</sup>, and a frequency shift Δω &lt; 1 ppm from bulk water, placing it in the slow to intermediate NMR exchange regime. This was first demonstrated by Haris et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref023">23</xref>], who later also described an increase in the CEST signal at 0.6 ppm in an 18–20 month old AD mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref013">13</xref>]. Higher concentrations of myoinositol in Alzheimer’s disease have also been demonstrated in the very early stages of disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref024">24</xref>]. An increase in myoinositol levels has been consistently observed in the posterior cingulate, hippocampus and anterior cingulate gyrus in mild cognitive impairment in the early stage of dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref022">22</xref>]. Together these studies suggest that myoinositol levels assessed by MR spectroscopy may index neuroinflammation and microglial activation. However, recent studies question the relationship between myoinositol and microglial activation. Datta et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref025">25</xref>] reported that MRS myoinositol levels were not associated with TSPO PET in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients, and studies on Alzheimer’s disease have proposed that myoinositol levels might be associated with amyloid plaque load instead of microglial activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<p>Administration of the neurotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a standard approach to activate microglia through binding to the Toll-like receptor 4, which dose-dependently induces secretion of inflammatory mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref027">27</xref>]. Previously, we showed that a weak peripheral dose of LPS (1 mg/kg iv) led to a rise in myoinositol levels within four hours in an APP/PS1 model of Alzheimer’s disease, but without microgliosis or morphological evidence of microglial activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref021">21</xref>]. This myoinositol increase was apparent in the APP/PS1 which failed to show a microglial response to LPS, but not in wild type controls, which did show a microglial response. This raised doubts whether myoinositol really was a glial marker in AD, as previously proposed by Murray et al. (25), but questions remain regarding the robustness of the peripheral LPS challenge given the poor brain penetration of LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref028">28</xref>]. Liu et al. reported CEST measurements following LPS injections in subcutaneous tumors (after a 1 mg/kg direct injection), but found no significant differences in the CEST signal one day after LPS administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref029">29</xref>]. No study has set out to investigate whether CEST MRI could be used to visualize changes following an LPS challenge directly in the brain.</p>
<p>In this pilot study we therefore aimed to explore whether CEST can detect the response to LPS-induced microglia activation in APP/PS1 transgenics and wild type controls. We expected that a challenge at a relatively low dose would be representative of the early inflammatory response present in many neuroinflammatory disorders and it would lead to differential levels of microglial activation in the AD model compared with wild-type (WT) controls. We further hypothesized that CEST MRI would allow to distinguish between these responses. To explore the origin of this CEST signal we measured a range of metabolite levels and in particular myoinositol measured by MR spectroscopy. Indeed, we found distinct responses of microglial activation through histology and CEST MRI could be used to differentiate them. However, the LPS challenge was highly variable and separation between animals with and without responses did not align with genotype.</p>

<title>Study design</title>
<p>Experimentally naïve female APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic and wild-type C57BL6/J (WT) mice were bred in the University Biomedical Service Unit (age: 3.0 ± 0.5 months old; weight: 23.0 ± 0.6 g). They were maintained in individually vented (IVC) cages under standard husbandry conditions on a 12/12 h light cycle, with lights on at 07:00 h; the room temperature, relative humidity and air exchange were automatically controlled. Animals were group-housed with <italic>ad libidum</italic> access to food and water, and provided with nesting material and a play tube.</p>
<p>Throughout the experiment, animals were kept under anesthesia with a mixture of oxygen and isoflurane (Isocare, 3% for induction and 1–2% for maintenance). Animals were positioned in a stereotactic head frame and a small hole was made in the skull using Bregma as reference at the following coordinates: - 2 mm anterior-posterior, 1.8 mm lateral (both hemispheres), and 1 mm dorsoventral. Mice were given an intracerebral administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 2 μL of 5 ng/μL) and phosphate buffered serum (PBS) contralaterally as vehicle control, before being transferred to the MR imaging system. Injections were carried out by two experimenters. MR experiments were carried out on a horizontal 9.4 T system (Agilent, Palo Alto, California) with Vnmrj 4.0 software. A 22 mm volume coil (Rapid Biomedical GmbH, Rimpar, Germany) was used for excitation and signal detection. Animals were positioned in the imaging system in a custom made frame to minimize movement. Eye gel (Lubrithal) was applied in both eyes to avoid desiccation. Body temperature and breathing rate (80–120 breaths/min) were monitored and maintained stable throughout the experiment. Brain metabolite levels were measured with MR spectroscopy, in two target volumes centered over the injection sites in the hippocampus, first on the LPS side, then, with 0.5h delay on the vehicle side where PBS was injected. Between the MRS scans, a CEST image was acquired with the imaging plane covering the injection sites. MR spectroscopy scans acquired on the vehicle (PBS) and LPS side were acquired 0.5h apart, so that the metabolite levels derived from the MR spectra would be at equal interval from the CEST scan acquisition time. Three hours after the start of the experiment mice were given an overdose of anesthesia, and brains were immediately extracted and immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for further processing for histology.</p>

For image readout, a single-slice segmented gradient echo sequence with a Gaussian excitation pulse and centric encoding was acquired in two segments with 64 phase encoding steps each (FOV = 20 x 20 mm, slice thickness 2 mm, matrix size 128 x 128). The acquisition time for the CEST image array was 6 min. The WASSR array consisted of a 0.5 s hard prepulse (0.1 μT), followed by the segmented GE readout with 35 offsets in ±1 ppm (acquisition time 5 min).

<p>Brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), stored at 4–8 °C for a minimum of 48 hours, and then embedded in paraffin wax on a tissue embedding station (Leica TP1020). 7 μm-thick coronal sections were cut throughout the hippocampus using a microtome (Microtome Slee Cut 4060), mounted on APES coated slides and dried overnight at 40°C. Immunostaining of Iba1 (ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1) was carried out as previously described (26). Sections were first re-hydrated in consecutive rinses in xylene, 100% ethanol, 70% ethanol and dH<sub>2</sub>O and then immersed in sodium citrate buffer for 20 minutes at 95–99°C for antigen retrieval. Once the solution was cooled down to 70°C, sections were washed in PBS, incubated in 1% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> solution to inhibit endogenous peroxidase activity, washed in PBS and blocked in 5% goat serum. Brain slices were then incubated with rabbit anti-Iba1 (Wako, cat. nr. 019–19741; 1:6000 in PBS-T) antibody for 1h at room temperature, washed in PBS, and incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody (Vectastain Elite ABC Kit, Rabbit IgG, Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA cat. nr.

<title>Microglial response to the inflammatory challenge</title>
<p>Histology was used to establish the response to the inflammatory challenge. All histological images were examined in blind by an experienced, board certified pathologist. A highly variable response was observed to the immune challenge, which could be readily distinguished in two categories: those animals with strong activation of microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref041">41</xref>] on the side where LPS was administered (LPS Iba1+, n = 6, 3 WT, 3 APPSwe/PS1), and those who did not show a response (LPS Iba1-, n = 6, 3 WT, 3 APPSwe/PS1), judged by the morphometry of the microglial cells. One animal appeared to show higher activation in four of five slides on the PBS injection side (PBS Iba1+, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212002.s001">S1 Table</xref>) and is excluded from statistics and reported separately. The qualitative assessment by the pathologist matched the independent quantitative assessment of microglial activation when microglial soma size was measured.</p>
<p>In the Iba1+ group, Iba-1 immunostaining showed a strong localized microglial response to LPS, which was higher compared with the contralateral side, where vehicle (PBS) only was administered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212002.g001">Fig 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212002.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). For Iba1+ the difference in soma size between the LPS vs the contralateral PBS side was 10.1 μm<sup>2</sup> (interquartile range: 6.8–15.5 μm<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.0041 paired t-test, p = 0.0087 Wilcoxon rank sum test). For Iba1-, the difference was -7.5 μm<sup>2</sup> (interquartile range: - 9.6–0.7 μm<sup>2</sup>). No differences in classification in response to the stimulus were observed between genotypes (Fisher exact test, p &gt;&gt;0.05). However, we observed a difference with respect to the experimenter carrying out the intracerebral injection, and the Iba+ animals were among the first to receive the LPS challenge (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212002.s001">S1 Table</xref>).

While in Iba1+ animals, mI levels relative to tCr on the side of the LPS injection tended to be higher compared with the contralateral vehicle side, these differences were not significant (LPS side: 0.82; interquartile range: 0.78–0.84; PBS side: 0.70; interquartile range: 0.69–0.74; n = 4, p = 0.21, paired t-test, p = 0.38, Wilcoxon rank sum test, n.s.). No significant difference between hemispheres was observed in Iba1- animals, where relative mI levels on the LPS side were 0.64 (interquartile range: 0.60–0.79) and on the PBS side: 0.72 (interquartile range: 0.65–0.79; n = 6, p = 0.56, paired t-test, p = 0.69, Wilcoxon rank sum test, n.s.).

<p>One animal, a transgenic APPSwe/PS1, did not align with the categorization in Iba1+ vs Iba1- after LPS administration, but showed more activation on the side where the control vehicle was injected (difference in soma size between LPS vs PBS side -0.15 μm<sup>2</sup>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this pilot study, we used intracerebral low dose LPS as an acute inflammation challenge in young wild type and AD mice. We designed the pilot study to explore whether CEST can index activation of microglia with this inflammatory challenge, and whether at these early stages of disease, MRS and CEST biomarkers would be sensitive enough to distinguish differential levels, if present, of activation in WT and AD animals. While an LPS challenge is an established procedure, we found the immune response at this dose to be highly variable; unilateral activation of microglia was seen by immunohistochemistry only in a subset of animals (‘Iba1+’).</p>
<p>To test whether CEST MRI could be a specific imaging biomarker to monitor the inflammatory response, we chose an LPS challenge as one of the more widely used experimental routes of inducing neuroinflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref045">45</xref>]. A lipopolysaccharide challenge is of particular interest in Alzheimer’s disease, since LPS may impact hallmarks of disease in mouse models of AD. Intrahippocampal LPS injections have been shown to reduce β-amyloid peptide load in transgenic AD mouse model mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref046">46</xref>]. Also, the LPS-derived TLR-4 ligand monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) restricts cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref047">47</xref>]. Moreover, LPS induces a stronger inflammatory response in AD model mice than in wild type controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref048">48</xref>]. We chose a direct injection into the hippocampus to allow intra-subject comparisons, and due to the poor brain penetration of LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref028">28</xref>]. We chose the low dose of LPS based on our earlier <italic>in vivo</italic> study, where we sought to elicit a differential response between WT and AD mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref021">21</xref>]. Specifically, we had found that peripheral, low dose (100 μg/kg) LPS led to a significant increase in myoinositol levels within four hours in the AD transgenic mice but not in WT controls. Consequently, in the current study we had expected that the direct intracerebral challenge would lead to differential levels of microglial activation in the AD model where primed microglia may be more susceptible. However, while a subset of animals showed a pronounced response to LPS readily identifiable in immunohistochemistry, this variation did not align with genotype. A possible explanation could be that at this young age, differences between genotypes are not very significant, since for example, this model only starts to show synaptic loss by 4 months, and plaques and gliosis by around 6 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref049">49</xref>].</p>
<p>Therefore, rather than separating the groups for analysis in WT and AD, instead we grouped animals based on whether a unilateral activation was observed (Iba1+ vs non Iba1-), by an expert blind to the study examining the slides from immunohistochemistry stained for the microglial marker protein Iba-1. The assessment by the pathologist served as the gold standard for separating the groups, and this did align with the difference in soma size as a quantitative measure between the two groups. Soma size was the measure we used in our previous study as a marker of microglia activation, although more accurate histological measures would allow to determine the presence of neuroinflammation. There is a linear, albeit weak relationship between the CEST signal and the quantitative histology measures, when considering the difference between the LPS injection site and the contralateral vehicle control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212002.s004">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>In those animals, where an acute intracerebral LPS challenge led to a pronounced microglial response, the CEST MRI signal at 0.6 ppm was higher in the brain hemisphere where LPS was injected, compared with the contralateral control with vehicle injection only. In our pilot study, myoinositol levels measured by MR spectroscopy tended to be higher following LPS but did not reach significance. A possible explanation is the smaller group size with MRS data, compared to histology and CEST. Two MRS datasets from the Iba1+ group had to be excluded due to the spectral quality (linewidth criteria).</p>
<p>A range of <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging techniques based on PET or MRI have been proposed to study neuroinflammation and its spatial distribution. PET imaging of the TSPO receptor is the best characterized translational technique for imaging neuroinflammation <italic>in vivo</italic>. MR contrast agents have been widely used to visualize local inflammation in the brain, for example with superparamagnetic iron oxide particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref050">50</xref>] or with perfluorocarbons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref051">51</xref>], which avoids background signal but lacks sensitivity. More targeted approaches to image neuroinflammation have been successful with contrast agents, for example dextran coated SPIOs, functionalized with antibodies or ligands that bind to specific targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref052">52</xref>]. An endogenous MR imaging biomarker that is sensitive and specific enough to detect LPS induced metabolic changes with high spatial resolution would be an important step, because once validated it could be readily transferred to clinical MR systems. Microstructural changes as a consequence of local neuroinflammation have been assessed with diffusion MRI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref053">53</xref>] or magnetization transfer imaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref054">54</xref>], but these approaches still lack specificity. A range of studies have assessed spectroscopic changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref009">9</xref>] at the expense of spatial resolution. CEST MRI has the potential to bridge this gap, targeting specific moieties while retaining spatial resolution. However, care must be taken when interpreting our results, because of challenges due to the model and the CEST contrast itself.</p>
<p>Hydroxyl groups have broad CEST effects in the 0–1.5 ppm region. Other visible contributions to the CEST spectrum in our data are the amine (2 ppm) and amine (3.5 ppm) peaks. The peak at 2 ppm is generally attributed to creatine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref055">55</xref>] and proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref056">56</xref>], but did not differ between groups that showed a more pronounced response to LPS (‘Iba1+’). CEST MRI in the frequency range below 1 ppm poses several technical challenges. First, CEST resonances from hydroxyl groups are strongly affected by direct water saturation since both the CEST effect and spillover or direct saturation of the free water pool increase with B<sub>1</sub> power. Direct saturation thus imposes a restriction on the RF pulse power and limits the CEST saturation efficiency. Secondly, static magnetic field (B<sub>0</sub>) inhomogeneities shift the water resonance frequency, which results in asymmetric direct water saturation and consequently in artefacts in asymmetry analysis. The sharp peak at ~ 0.2 ppm (vehicle control–Iba1- group) is a B<sub>0</sub> artifact. Accurate correction of field inhomogeneities is crucial for CEST asymmetry measurements. After extensive shimming before each MR measurement, we used the WASSR method to map the water frequency. However, there are still changes in susceptibility in regions of tissue—air interface. We therefore filled the space between the top of the head and the volume coil with agarose to reduce susceptibility artifacts and reduce variability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212002.s005">S4 Fig</xref>). We only quantified CEST changes if a sufficient B<sub>0</sub> field homogeneity across both regions of interest in the hippocampus was achieved. Many groups studying the APT (amide proton transfer, around 3.5 ppm) signal are using Lorentzian fitting methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref057">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref058">58</xref>], mainly because of asymmetric magnetization transfer (MT) effects around the water peak. Asymmetric MT does not have a significant effect on the CEST contrast for frequency offsets close to the water peak. Furthermore, in cases where CEST pool line shapes have merged with that of water (as in the case of hydroxyl groups), the line shape is not Lorentzian anymore and fitting will fail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref059">59</xref>]. Hence asymmetry analysis is most suited to our analysis even though it does not allow to extract subtle details of the signal.</p>
<p>We cannot simply attribute the inflammatory response to the impact of LPS, because a range of factors contribute to the inflammatory response and the signals measured by MR spectroscopy and CEST MRI. The high variability we observed in microglia activity (Iba-1) could be caused by differences in the efficiency of LPS delivery between experimenters, brain injury during injection, or for example the drug viability over time (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212002.s001">S1 Table</xref>). To avoid bias, we therefore based our analysis and interpretation on the resulting Iba1 activity as the starting point.</p>
<p>An intrinsic complication for the interpretation of the CEST signal is the overlap of different molecules in the region of the myoinositol resonance. Several groups demonstrated how metabolites that contribute to the CEST signal overlap, including glutamate, glutamine, creatine, taurine and many endogenous molecules contain exchangeable–OH therefore potentially contributing to the total CEST signal (e.g. glucose, choline and myoinositol, glycerophosphocholine, and glycoproteins) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref057">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref060">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref062">62</xref>], an effect that we also reproduced here (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212002.s006">S5 Fig</xref>). Therefore, direct attribution of the observed CEST effect to a specific metabolite change would require completely isolating this from other contributions, which is difficult when studying the cascade of molecular events involved in inflammation. In our study, we measured in addition to myoinositol a range of metabolites that overlap with the CEST signal &lt; 1ppm, but did not find any significant changes after the LPS challenge. We did also exclude an effect of the drug molecule itself on the CEST signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212002.s006">S5 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The injury caused by vehicle injection into the brain alone will cause a degree of microglial activation and injection sites were visible in T<sub>2</sub> maps (but not in T<sub>2</sub> weighted images), although signal levels in T<sub>2</sub> maps did not differ between LPS and vehicle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212002.s003">S2 Fig</xref>). In our experiment, we controlled the effect of the injection with contralateral vehicle administration, but this does not isolate the effect of LPS.</p>
<p>An improvement of the current protocol may be to acquire CEST MRI and MRS separately before and after each injection (LPS and vehicle). This would allow a more careful distinction of the effects of the intervention and allow to separate the effect of LPS and injection, but require a setup where LPS and vehicle are administered in the scanner rather than the approach chosen here where procedures are separated.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that the area of microglial activation in histology does not precisely fit an outline of the area of higher signal in CEST MRI. This may be due to the difficulties in clearly delineating LPS enhancement or the CEST threshold chosen, but also to differences in the volume covered by the different techniques. For the quantitative assessment of our CEST MRI images and the histology, we chose a region of interest centered on the target of the injection, which was the same size in the image plane but differed in the slice thickness (2 mm for CEST, 7 μm for histology). However, the distinction into Iba1+ and Iba1- was based on the qualitative assessment of the pathologist.</p>
<p>We had hypothesized that a change in the CEST signal would be accompanied by an increase in the levels of myoinositol measured by MRS. In the group of animals responding strongly to LPS, myoinositol levels tended to be higher after LPS but did not reach significance. We also tested, post-hoc, other potential inflammation markers, including glutamate, choline and creatine, but these did not show significant differences. We had expected a myoinositol increase, since in contrast to our earlier study with peripheral LPS administration, we opted for the direct LPS challenge, where initial scans suggested the change in myoinositol levels. Our study does not in itself really clarify the role of myoinositol as an MRS biomarker for neuroinflammation, partially due to the limited size of our pilot study. We initially chose myoinositol due to the number of studies pointing to its potential to index neuroinflammation, but recent work from our group and others question a direct link to microglial activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref023">23</xref>]. Datta et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref025">25</xref>] reported that MRS determined myoinositol levels were not associated with TSPO PET in patients with Multiple Sclerosis. The authors suggested that both measures might be related to the same common process but with different time courses, or to different processes, with histopathology results suggesting a link between myoinositol and astrocyte activation.</p>
<p>Future experiments could benefit from another inflammatory model. Sauvage et al. locally induced astrocytic activation through lateral injection of lentiviral vectors encoding either the human CNTF gene or the β-galactosidase gene as control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref014">14</xref>]. This is a very robust challenge which may not be representative of neuroinflammation occurring in early stages of disease, but a similar approach may be feasible that is selective for microglia. Further validation will also be necessary, for example with another imaging modality such as with TSPO PET, or the suppression of the inflammatory response with minocycline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref063">63</xref>].</p>
<p>In terms of acquisition, a chemical exchange-sensitive spin lock type of experiment (higher power and shorter irradiation) would increase the sensitivity to faster exchanging spins (such as hydroxyls), while minimizing the influence of slower exchanging spins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref064">64</xref>]. While CEST MRI benefits from higher magnetic field strength, there is potential for hydroxyl CEST in the clinic, with recent work showing that variable saturation amplitude CEST can improve sensitivity at 3T [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212002.ref065">65</xref>].</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this study, we set out to monitor the response to LPS as an inflammatory stimulus with CEST. Our data suggests that CEST MRI in the hydroxyl region is sensitive to the effect of a low dose LPS inflammatory challenge in mice that show a pronounced microglial response. The immune response to LPS was highly variable and did not align with genotype. This may be due to the variability in the response to the intracerebral LPS injection, or the young age of the animals (3 months old), which may be too early to detect differences between genotypes. The sensitivity of CEST could not be explained by changes in myoinositol levels measured by MR spectroscopy, even though they tended to be higher. If a sufficiently sensitive CEST measure for neuroinflammation could be established on a clinical scanner, it could have important implications for drug development and early diagnosis in neurodegenerative disorders.</p>
