<abstract>
<p>Fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) is a multifunctional polypeptide belonging to the FGF family and has functions related to bone formation, lens-fiber differentiation, nerve development, gap-junction formation and sex determination. In a previous study, we demonstrated that FGF9 stimulates the production of testosterone in mouse Leydig cells. In the present study, we used both primary mouse Leydig cells and MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells to further investigate the molecular mechanism of FGF9-stimulated steroidogenesis. Results showed that FGF9 significantly activated steroidogenesis in both mouse primary and tumor Leydig cells (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). Furthermore, FGF9 significantly induced the expression of phospho-Akt at 0.5 and 24 hr, phospho-JNK at 0.25, 0.5, and 24 hr, phospho-p38 at 0.5 hr, and phospho-ERK1/2 from 0.25 to 24 hr in primary Leydig cells (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). Also, FGF9 significantly up-regulated the expression of phospho-Akt at 3 hr, phospho-JNK at 0.25 hr, and phospho-ERK1/2 at 1 and 3 hr in MA-10 cells (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). Using specific inhibitors of Akt, JNK, p38, and ERK1/2, we further demonstrated that the inhibitors of Akt and ERK1/2 significantly suppressed the stimulatory effect of FGF9 on steroidogenesis in mouse Leydig cells. In conclusion, FGF9 specifically activated the Akt and ERK1/2 in normal mouse Leydig cells and the Akt, JNK and ERK1/2 in MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells to stimulate steroidogenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) was first isolated from the culture supernatant of the human glioma cell line NMC-G1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Naruo1">[1]</xref> and has been shown to participate in neuron development, bone formation, lens-fiber differentiation, gap-junction formation, sex determination, and steroidogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Cohen1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Lin1">[8]</xref>. In fact, studies have demonstrated that FGF9 is expressed in the embryonic and postnatal male reproductive tract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Colvin1">[3]</xref>. Moreover, FGF9-knockout mice die after birth as a consequence of hypoxia in lung cells and exhibit various phenomena, such as testicular hypoplasia and male-to-female sex reversion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Colvin1">[3]</xref>. Other studies have shown that FGF9 participates in sex determination by maintaining SOX9 expression and seminiferous tubule formation, and failure of FGF9 expression results in abnormal testicular development in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Hiramatsu1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Chung1">[11]</xref>. Together, these evidences suggest that FGF9 plays an important role in male gonadal development and function. Colvin's 2001 study showed that expression of the cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme (Scc) decreases in FGF9-knockout mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Colvin1">[3]</xref>. In a previous study, we demonstrated that FGF9 increases testosterone production in postnatal mouse Leydig cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Lin1">[8]</xref>, implying that FGF9 may regulate steroidogenesis in male reproductive tissues.</p>
<p>Testosterone promotes gonad development and maintains reproductive functions in male adults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Saez1">[12]</xref>. Furthermore, steroidogenesis in Leydig cells is regulated by luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin (LH/CG), and binding of LH to its receptor on the surface of Leydig cells triggers the Gs/adenylyl cyclase/cAMP/PKA signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Ascoli1">[13]</xref>. Although PKA-mediated protein phosphorylation is undoubtedly important in regulating steroidogenesis, other signaling systems have also been implicated, including protein kinase C (PKC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Hirakawa1">[14]</xref>, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Brion1">[15]</xref>, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Ahn1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>FGF receptor (FGFR) is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family and plays important roles in cell proliferation and survival under diverse stimulation of growth factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Johnson1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Niederst1">[18]</xref>. Binding of FGF to FGFR initiates various signal transduction pathways, such as the MAPK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Pearson1">[19]</xref>, PI3K <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Eswarakumar1">[20]</xref>, and phospholipase C gamma (PLCγ) pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Mohammadi1">[21]</xref>. Additionally, MAPKs have three downstream signal relays to pass the growth factor signals, including the signals mediated by extracellular signal–regulated kinases 1 and 2 (Erk1/2), c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Johnson2">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our previous study demonstrated that FGF9 increases testosterone production principally through the Ras/MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways rather than the PLCγ pathway in Leydig cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Lin1">[8]</xref>. In the present study, using both mouse primary and tumor Leydig cells, we further explored how FGF9 could activate JNK, p38, ERK1/2, and Akt, which are the downstream signal transduction mediators of the Ras/MAPK and PI3K pathways.</p>

<title>Isolation of mouse primary Leydig cells</title>
<p>Leydig cells were isolated from 5- to 6-week-old immature B6 mice. Mouse testes were removed from sacrificed mice and decapsulated in M199 medium. Decapsulated testes were then incubated in a shaking water bath (120 cycles/min) at 37°C for 15 min in M199 containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 100 U/ml collagenase type II. Seminiferous tubules were separated from interstitial cells by gravity sedimentation. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 300× <italic>g</italic> for 6 min and resuspended in 2 ml of M199 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. This interstitial cell preparation was layered by a Percoll™ (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) gradient and then centrifuged at 800× <italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 20 min.

<title>FGF9 increases steroidogenesis in both mouse primary and tumor Leydig cells</title>
<p>Mouse primary Leydig cells were treated with different concentrations of FGF9 (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 2.5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 ng/ml) for 24 hr. Results showed that FGF9 at induced testosterone production in a dose-dependent phenomenon. In fact, 1, 2.5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 ng/ml FGF9 stimulated 1.8-, 2.2-, 2.7-, 3.5-, 3.7-, and 4.0-fold increases of testosterone, respectively, compared with the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090243-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).

<p>MA-10 cells are a mouse Leydig tumor cell line that produces progesterone rather than testosterone owing to a defect in 17α-hydroxylase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Ascoli2">[24]</xref>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previously, we demonstrated that FGF9 increases testosterone production in mouse primary Leydig cells through the Ras/MAPK, PI3K, and PKA pathways but not through the PLCγ pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Lin1">[8]</xref>. In the present study, we further showed that FGF9 could induce testosterone and progesterone production in mouse primary and tumor Leydig cells, respectively, through the induction of phospho-Akt, -JNK, -p38, and/or -ERK1/2, which are the downstream components of Ras and MAPK signal transduction pathways.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that the binding of FGF to FGFR initiates the PI3K pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Eswarakumar1">[20]</xref>, and steroidogenesis is regulated by the PI3K pathway in Leydig cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Ahn1">[16]</xref>. Moreover, factors such prohibitin and restistin can activate the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway to regulate steroidogenesis in bovine and rat granulosa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Wang1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Maillard1">[28]</xref>. In the present study, we showed that FGF9 activated the phosphorylation of Akt both in mouse primary and tumor Leydig cells, which is consistent with those studies.</p>
<p>Studies have demonstrated that steroidogenesis is regulated by many signaling pathways, such as the cAMP/PKA, PI3K, and MAPK pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Ascoli1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Manna1">[26]</xref>. It has been shown that gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) activates ERK1/2, rather than JNK or p38, to increase transcription/translation of the gene encoding 3β-HSD and subsequent testosterone production in rat primary Leydig cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Yao1">[29]</xref>. Furthermore, 8-Br-cAMP induces transcription/translation of steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein and progesterone production through ERK1/2 activation in MA-10 Leydig cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Brion1">[15]</xref>. Moreover, bisphenol A, an endocrine disrupter, activates the CRE, PKA, Akt, and MAP kinase signaling pathways to regulate testosterone production in rat Leydig cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Kim1">[30]</xref>. Thus, there is no doubt that JNK, p38, and ERK1/2 may be involved in regulating steroidogenesis. Parallel to those studies, we showed that FGF9 also activated the phosphorylation of JNK, ERK1/2, and/or p38 in mouse primary and tumor Leydig cells.</p>
<p>In our results, a temporal difference in the phosphorylation of Akt, JNK, p38, and ERK1/2 between mouse primary and tumor Leydig cells was observed. In general, phospho-Akt, -JNK, -p38, and -ERK1/2 were induced by FGF9 within 30 min in mouse primary Leydig cells. However, the period prior to phosphorylation was more unpredictable in MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells in that FGF9 stimulated phospho-Akt at 3 hr, phospho-JNK at 15 min, phospho-ERK1/2 at 1 and 3 hr, but no expression of phospho-p38. Studies have clearly shown that normal and tumor cells may exhibit different protein expression patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Qiao1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Romero1">[32]</xref>. Moreover, different expression of FGF9 and FGF9 receptors between normal and abnormal cells have been well documented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Chung1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Falvella1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Coffey1">[34]</xref>. Furthermore, studies have also shown that the binding of FGF to FGFR initiates various signal transduction pathways in different cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Pearson1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Mohammadi1">[21]</xref>. Thus, our observations of differential temporal expression of phospho-Akt, -JNK, -p38, and -ERK1/2 between mouse primary and tumor Leydig cells is not unprecedented.</p>
<p>In the present study, p38 was activated by FGF9 in primary Leydig cells. However, FGF9 did not activate any phospho-p38 expression in MA-10 cells. Studies have shown that overexpression of oncogenic MAP 17 in breast tumors relies on p38 insensitivity to induce intracellular reactive oxygen species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Guijarro1">[35]</xref>. Furthermore, p38/MAPK activation participates in apoptosis in epithelial cells through an unknown cell elimination process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Norman1">[36]</xref>. Thus, the loss of p38 activation might be involved in mouse Leydig cell tumorigenesis, which should be further investigated.</p>
<p>Our data showed that inhibitors of the Akt and MAPK pathways (wortmannin, SP600125, SB202190, and PD98059) had different effects on mouse primary and tumor Leydig cells. Akt and ERK1/2 inhibitors suppressed the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 in the presence of FGF9 in both mouse primary and tumor Leydig cells. However, the JNK inhibitor (SP600125) had no effect on primary mouse Leydig cells but suppressed phosphorylation of JNK in MA-10 cells in the presence of FGF9. SP600125 has different apoptotic effects depending on differences in the level of galectin-7 between urothelial carcinomas and normal urothelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Matsui1">[37]</xref>. Thus, SP600125 may have different effects on mouse primary and tumor Leydig cells.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we found that the p38 inhibitor (SB202190) had no effect in mouse primary Leydig cells. However, SB202190 potentiated FGF9 to activate phospho-p38 expression in MA-10 cells. Studies have reported that SB202190 induces cell death by cross-inhibition of the PI3K-PKB/Akt-mTOR pathway, but not the p38 pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Menon1">[38]</xref>, that SB202190- or SB203580-induced JNK activation is dependent on the MLK-3-MKK4/MKK7-dependent signal transduction pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Muniyappa1">[39]</xref>, and that SB202190 activates ERK1/2 to promote the progression of leukemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090243-Hirosawa1">[40]</xref>. These reports suggest that SB202190 may regulate other signaling pathways among various cell types rather than inhibit p38 activity. Thus, SB202190 and FGF9 may mutually potentiate p38 phosphorylation in MA-10 cells, which should be further investigated].</p>
<p>In conclusion, FGF9 specifically activated Akt and ERK1/2 in mouse primary Leydig cells and activated Akt, JNK, and ERK1/2 in MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells to stimulate steroidogenesis. Our study not only illustrates the relationship between FGF9 and Leydig cell functions but also reveals different properties between normal and tumor Leydig cells.</p>
