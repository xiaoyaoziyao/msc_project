<abstract>
<p>B cells constitute a complex system of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and exist as distinct subsets that differ in their lineage affiliation, surface molecule expression, and biological function, thus potentially regulating the immune response. In this study, we investigated the immune-regulatory roles of murine B cell subsets as regulatory APCs targeting alloreactive T cells. Either splenic B cells, peritoneal cavity (PerC) B cells, or non-B cells from Balb/c mice were intravenously injected into B6 mice. Serum levels of anti-Balb/c antibodies in the recipients of PerC B cells were significantly lower than those in the recipients of splenic B cells and PerC non-B cells, as determined over a 4-week period after the injection. Mixed-lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assays using splenocytes from the B6 mice at 2 weeks after the injection revealed the significantly reduced anti-Balb/c T cell-responses in the recipients of PerC B cells, as compared to those in the recipients of splenic B cells or untreated control mice. Since PerC B cells contained MHC class II<sup>+</sup> CD80<sup>+</sup> CD86<sup>+</sup> PD-L1<sup>+</sup> PD-L2<sup>+</sup> cells among the CD5<sup>+</sup> B-1a cell subset, PerC B cells from Balb/c mice were pre-incubated with anti-PD-L1/PD-L2 mAbs prior to injection. This treatment abrogated their immune-regulatory effects on anti-Balb/c T cells in the MLR assays. In addition, the inoculation with Balb/c PerC B cells significantly prolonged the survival of subsequently grafted Balb/c hearts in B6 mouse recipients, whereas that with SPL B cells did not. These findings indicate that the PerC B cells, including PD-L1/PD-L2 B-1a cells, may suppress T cells responding to allostimulation, and thus may be optimal for donor lymphocyte injection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>T-cell activation during sensitization or rejection in organ transplant recipients first needs antigen presentation to T cells by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells. B cells are well known to play a role in allostimulation of T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178765.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178765.ref004">4</xref>]. B cells not only constitute a complex system of APCs but also exist as distinct subsets that differ in their lineage affiliation, surface molecule expression, and biological function, thus potentially regulating the immune responses. B cells play a central role in humoral immunity, but specific B cell subsets can also regulate T cell responses to foreign and self-antigens. These B cells are called regulatory B cells (Breg), and different types have been reported to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178765.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178765.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>As one part of Breg cells, B cells were found to express programmed death-ligand (PD-L) 1 and PD-L2, which are one of the key factors responsible for inhibitory T cell signaling, providing immune homeostasis and mediating the mechanisms of tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178765.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178765.ref020">20</xref>], PD-L1 is constitutively expressed by various immune cells and nonimmune cells, whereas PD-L2 expression is expressed only by APCs such as macrophages and dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178765.ref021">21</xref>]. In addition, constitutive expression of PD-L2 together with PD-L1 is observed on 50–70% of mouse peritoneal CD5<sup>+</sup> B-1a cells, a unique B cell subset, that act as efficient APCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178765.ref017">17</xref>]. Although the molecular and cellular functions of PD-L1 and PD-L2 in these B-1a cells currently remain unclear, these molecules per se are known to have a physiological role in regulating autologous T cell-immune responses in self-immunity by engaging PD-1.</p>
<p>This knowledge prompted us to investigate if the unique B cell subset that expresses PD-L1 and PD-L2 also inhibits alloimmune T cell responses. The present study has demonstrates that the infusion of allogeneic PD-L1<sup>+</sup>/PD-L2<sup>+</sup> B-1 cells suppresses T cells responding to cognate allostimulation. Thus, the present study provides a novel approach to induce T-cell hyporesponsiveness against transplanted allografts by infusing donor specific B-1 cells.</p>

<title>Mice</title>
<p>C57BL/6 (B6; H-2D<sup>b</sup>) and Balb/c (H-2D<sup>d</sup>) mice were purchased from CLEA Japan (Tokyo, Japan). All the mice were housed in the animal facility of Hiroshima University, in a pathogen-free, micro-isolated environment and were used at an age of 8–12 weeks. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Hiroshima University and were handled and conducted according to the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health (publication no.86-23, revised 1996). Animal welfare was carefully ensured constantly by experienced operators every day. Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation after inhalation of isofluran, when indicated. All efforts were made to minimize suffering of the animals along all the duration of their life and during the sacrifice.</p>

<title>Cell preparation</title>
<p>Mononuclear cell suspensions from the spleen (SPL), peritoneal cavity (PerC), liver, bone marrow (BM), cervical lymph node (CLN), and peripheral blood (PB) were prepared. B cells from the mouse SPL or PerC were purified by performing positive selection with CD19 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, San Diego, CA, USA) and an autoMACS Separator (Miltenyi Biotec), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Non-B cells from the PerC were purified by negative selection at the same time. Purity of the isolated B and non-B cells was assessed by flow cytometry (FCM) and was typically found to be &gt;95%.</p>
<p>When indicated, 10 × 10<sup>6</sup> of B cells isolated from PerC of Balb/c mice were incubated with anti-PD-L1 (10F.9G2, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) and/or anti-PD-L2 (TY25, BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA, USA) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for 30 min at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator prior to injection. Rat immunoglobulin G (IgG) 2b (R35-38, BD Pharmingen) and IgG2a (R35-95, BD Pharmingen) were used as isotype-matched control IgGs for anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-L2 mAbs, respectively. All cell cultures were performed in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin, and 50 μM 2-ME.</p>

<title>FCM analysis</title>
<p>Mononuclear cells freshly isolated from the SPL, PerC, liver, BM, CLN, and PB were incubated for 30 min at 4°C with the following diluted fluorescently labeled mAbs: PD-L1-phycoerythrin (PE) (MIH5; BD Pharmingen), PD-L2-PE (TY25; BD Pharmingen), FasL-PE (MFL3; BD Pharmingen), CD80-PE (16-10AI; BD Pharmingen), CD86-PE (GL1; BD Pharmingen), CD4-PE (L3T4; BD Pharmingen), CD5-PE-Cy7 (53–7.3; BioLegend), CD8a-PE (53–6.7; BD Pharmingen), CD8a-PE-Cy7 (53–6.7; BD Pharmingen), CD11b-APC-Cy7 (M1/70; BD Pharmingen), CD19-FITC (1D3; BD Pharmingen), IgM-allophycocyanine (APC) (II/41; BD Pharmingen), H-2D<sup>d</sup>-PE (34-2-12; BD Pharmingen), CD40-PE (3/23; BD Pharmingen), TRAIL-PE(N2B2; eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA), and IA/IE-PE(M5/114.15.2 BD Pharmingen). The following isotype matched control IgGs were used; mouse IgG 2a,k-PE, Hamster IgG1,λ1-PE-Cy7, mouse IgG2a,k-FITC, mouse IgG1-APC, and mouse IgG1-APC-Cy7.

<p>Two weeks before heart transplantation, recipient B6 mice were intravenously injected with 10 × 10<sup>6</sup> SPL or PerC CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells from Balb/c mice. Prior to surgery, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of xylazine (5 mg/kg body weight) and ketamine (100 mg/kg body weight). Cervical heterotopic heart transplantation from Balb/c mice into naïve B6 mice or B cell injected B6 mice was performed using a modified cuff technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178765.ref024">24</xref>]. Briefly, the right external jugular vein and the right common carotid artery were dissected free and were fixed to the appropriate cuffs composed of polyethylene tubes. For anastomoses, the aorta and the main pulmonary artery of the obtained donor heart were drawn over the external jugular vein, respectively. Graft ischemic time for the transplanted hearts was &lt; 30 min. The function of the grafts was monitored daily through inspection and palpation. Rejection was determined based on the cessation of heart beat and was confirmed by performing histological analysis. Mice were daily monitored for weight and well being. If there was evidence of more than 15% weight loss compared to weight at surgery-date, no food intake, breathing difficulties, apathy, or a hunched position as well as when the heart was rejected, animals were euthanized. Two mice were excluded from the evaluation of graft survival because they suddenly died of unknown cause with beating allograft heart.</p>

<title>Naïve B-1a cells from PerC highly expressed PD-L1, PD-L2, CD80, CD86, and MHC class II</title>
<p>To search for B cells having the potential to induce hyporesponsiveness of T cells to allostimulation, we investigated the phenotypic characteristics of naïve B cells from SPL, PerC, liver, BM, PB, and CLN in an anatomical screening for immune-regulatory and co-stimulatory membrane markers. Expressions of MHC class II, CD80, and CD86—surface molecules necessary for efficient antigen presentation to T cells—and the immune-regulatory molecules anti-PD-L1, PD-L2, FasL, and TRAIL were analyzed. In Balb/c mice, naïve B cells from PerC showed remarkably higher levels of PD-L1, PD-L2, CD80, and CD86 compared to those in other organs, while FasL and TRAIL were rarely expressed on B cells from any organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0178765.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Mean percentage of PD-L1, PD-L2, CD80, and CD86 expression on B cells from PerC was statistically higher than that from any other organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0178765.g001">Fig 1B</xref>. FasL and TRAIL on B cells from each organ showed generally low frequency and no difference was detected in all 6 organs. MHC class II was expressed on almost all B cells.

<p>We further analyzed the expression of immune-regulatory molecules on the various B cell subsets isolated from the SPL, PerC, and liver. SPL cells were stained with combinations of mAbs directed against IgM and CD21 with a variety of immune-regulatory molecules. Since marginal zone (MZ), follicular (FO), and newly formed B cells, which constitute anatomically distinct B cell subsets in the SPL, differ in their expression of IgM and CD21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178765.ref025">25</xref>], a combination of these markers can be used to select these three subsets by gating (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0178765.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). CD21<sup>high</sup> IgM<sup>high</sup> MZ B cells, which are uniquely positioned near antigen trapping cells in the marginal sinus, where their association with macrophages facilitates their exposure to blood-borne antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178765.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178765.ref026">26</xref>], exclusively expressed a high level of PD -L1, but barely expressed PD-L2. The expression of those PD-L1/L2 was limited on CD21<sup>int</sup> IgM<sup>int</sup> FO B cells, which were positioned adjacent to T cell areas, facilitating their response to T cell-dependent antigens and promoting germinal center formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178765.ref026">26</xref>], and CD21<sup>-/low</sup> IgM<sup>high</sup> newly formed B-0 cells, which had recently immigrated from the BM into the SPL.</p>
<p>PerC and liver B cells are divided into three distinct subsets, CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD5<sup>+</sup> B-1a cells, CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD5<sup>-</sup> B-1b, and CD11b<sup>-</sup>CD5<sup>-</sup> B-2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0178765.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Distinct from the conventional subset B-2 cells, the role of B-1a and B-1b cells as effectors of innate-like immunity is widely accepted, although the functional difference between B-1a and B-1b cells remains to be resolved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178765.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178765.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178765.ref036">36</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Numerous reports have demonstrated that pretransplant exposure to allogeneic donor antigens through donor leukocyte injection (DLI) or blood transfusion, either alone or in combination with other treatments, can facilitate donor-specific hyporesponsiveness. Some studies have investigated the subsets of allogeneic donor cells that may be important for inhibiting anti-donor immune responses, but the results remain controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178765.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178765.ref042">42</xref>]. A previous study demonstrated that a single injection of naïve donor SPL B cells prior to transplantation resulted in significantly prolonged donor-specific skin allograft survival compared to that of the infusion of non-B cells in an MHC class I-mismatched model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178765.ref043">43</xref>], indicating the important role of donor B cells in prolonging the survival of donor-specific skin allografts. However, a significant immune-regulatory effects of injection with SPL B cells has not been demonstrated in a MHC class I/II-mismatched model using a fully allogeneic combination. We demonstrated that intravenous injection of Balb/c SPL B cells in B6 mice resulted in the remarkable production of anti-Balb/c Abs and enhanced T cell responses to Balb/c-allostimulation in B6 recipient mice. In contrast, the injection of Balb/c PerC B cells, which contained B-1a cells co-expressing PD-L1 and PD-L2, in B6 mice lead to the remarkable suppression of anti-Balb/c Abs and the significant inhibition of T cell responses to Balb/c-allostimulation. The experiments using blocking mAbs targeting PD-L1 and PD-L2 suggest that the expression of both PD-L1 and PD-L2 on allogeneic PerC B cells is required to inhibit T cell-responses to the cognate allostimulation through engaging PD-1. Thus, PD-L1<sup>+</sup> PD-L2<sup>+</sup> B-1a cells from PerC may be optimal as a subset of allogeneic DLI for inhibiting anti-donor alloimmune-responses.</p>
<p>PD-L1 and PD-L2 coexpression on B-1a cells potentially has important regulatory functions in alloimmune reponses. Since PD-L1<sup>+</sup> PD-L2<sup>+</sup> B-1a cells share most of the surface markers with PD-L1<sup>+</sup> PD-L2<sup>-</sup> B-1a cells, it is very difficult to sort PD-L2<sup>+</sup> B-1a cells without using anti-PD-L2 mAb, which blocks and interferes with PD-L2 physiological function. To avoid this problem, an endogenous indicator system for tracking and sorting PD-L1<sup>+</sup> PD-L2<sup>+</sup> B-1a cells is highly desirable for applying this particular subset of B cells to DLI prior to allografting.</p>
<p>Even without sorting PD-L1<sup>+</sup> PD-L2<sup>+</sup> B-1a cells, the injection of unfractionated PerC B cells resulted in the avoidance of allo-sensitization, and even induced T cell-hyporesponsiveness in response to allostimulation. Inoculation of allogeneic PerC B cells significantly prolonged the survival of subsequently grafted cognate allogeneic hearts; however, the heart allografts were eventually rejected. One possible explanation for the limited prolongation of allograft survival by allogeneic PerC B cells is that these cells may exert efficient suppressive effects on T cells with direct allospecificity, but not on T cells with indirect allospecificity, which are also involved in rejecting allografted organs. To address this issue, it is necessary to determine the mechanisms underlying the role of PD-L1 and PD-L2 expressed on allogeneic PerC B cells in inhibiting T cells that directly recognize alloantigens.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the allogeneic PerC B cells, including the MHC class II<sup>+</sup> CD80<sup>+</sup> CD86<sup>+</sup> PD-L1<sup>+</sup> PD-L2<sup>+</sup> B-1a cell subset, have the potential to suppress T cells responding to the cognate allostimulation.</p>

<title>Division of B-cell subsets from SPL, PerC and liver by FCM assay.</title>
<p>Naïve B cells from SPL, PerC and liver were stained with various combinations of mAbs directed against IgM, CD19, CD21, CD11b, CD5, PD-L1, PD-L2, FasL, TRAIL, CD80, CD86, and MHC class II, and analyzed by FCM. Then, these cells were divided into subsets: CD21<sup>int</sup>IgM<sup>int</sup> follicular B cells, CD21<sup>high</sup>IgM<sup>high</sup> marginal zone B, and CD21<sup>-/low</sup>IgM<sup>high</sup> B-0 cells in the spleen, and CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD5<sup>+</sup> B-1a cells, CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD5<sup>-</sup> B-1b, and CD11b<sup>-</sup>CD5<sup>-</sup> B-2 cells in PerC and liver.</p>

<title>PD-L1/PD-L2 expression on B cells pre-incubated with anti-PD-L1/PD-L2 mAb.</title>
<p>Anti-PD-L1 mAb and/or anti-PD-L2 mAb was added to isolated PerC B cells with incubation for 30 min at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. Isotype-matched control IgG was used instead of anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-L2 mAb; Rat IgG2b for anti-PD-L1 mAb, Rat IgG2a for anti-PD-L2 mAb. None of isotype-matched control IgGs interfered with the expression of PD-L1 or PD-L2 on PerC B cells. PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression on B cells was analyzed by FCM assay. Anti-CD19 mAb was used as a B cell marker. Dashed lines on histograms represented isotype-matched control.</p>
