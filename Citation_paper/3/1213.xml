        <p>Activation of the sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R) improves functional recovery in models of experimental stroke and is known to modulate microglia function. The present study was conducted to investigate if Sig-1R activation after experimental stroke affects mediators of the inflammatory response in the ischemic hemisphere. Male Wistar rats were subjected to transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) and injected with the specific Sig-1R agonist 1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)-4-(3-phenylpropyl)piperazine dihydrochloride (SA4503) or saline for 5 days starting on day 2 after MCAO. Treatment did not affect the increased levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin 4 (IL-4), interleukin 5 (IL-5), and interleukin 13 (IL-13) in the infarct core and peri-infarct area after MCAO. In addition, treatment with SA4503 did not affect elevated levels of nitrite, TNF-α and IL-1β observed in primary cultures of microglia exposed to combined Hypoxia/Aglycemia, while the unspecific sigma receptor ligand 1,3-di-o-tolylguanidine (DTG) significantly decreased the production of nitrite and levels of TNF-α. Analysis of the ischemic hemisphere also revealed increased levels of ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) levels in the infarct core of SA4503 treated animals. However, no difference in Iba1 immunoreactivity was detected in the infarct core. Also, levels of the proliferation marker proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and OX-42 were not increased in the infarct core in rats treated with SA4503. Together, our results suggest that sigma-1 receptor activation affects Iba1 expression in microglia/macrophages of the ischemic hemisphere after experimental stroke but does not affect post-stroke inflammatory mediators.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Stroke induces an inflammatory response, which includes the activation and accumulation of resident microglia and peripheral leukocytes in the ischemic hemisphere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Iadecola1">[1]</xref>. Activation is regulated by specific molecules such as the NLRP1 inflammasome complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Abulafia1">[2]</xref>, and is also affected by the tissue microenvironment such as pH changes or production of reactive radicals such as reactive oxygen species from damaged cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Block1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A variety of cytokines, neurotrophic factors, neuropeptides, as well as neurotransmitters alter the activation state of microglia/macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Aloisi1">[4]</xref> which can be monitored by the expression of ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Ito1">[5]</xref>. Microglia/macrophages might be benefical and tissue protective <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Streit1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Smirkin1">[8]</xref>. Under pathological conditions, however, overactivation of microglia in the injured brain may contribute to further tissue damage and aggravation of secondary neuronal loss at the site of injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Schroeter1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Upon brain ischemia, microglia/macrophages release inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β in models of stroke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Barone1">[10]</xref>. An increased cytokine production may propagate the formation of reactive gliosis with consequences for the re-establishment and formation of neuronal circuits and be unfavorable for recovery of lost neurological function after stroke. Previous studies have shown that activation of the Sig-1R reduces microglia activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Hall1">[11]</xref>, and application of the unspecific sigma receptor ligand 1,3-di-o-tolylguanidine (DTG) suppressed the release of TNF-α, IL-10, and nitric oxide in lipopolysaccharide activated cells. In addition, enhanced neuronal survival observed after delayed DTG administration following experimental stroke was attributed to a reduced inflammatory response in the ischemic hemisphere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Ajmo1">[12]</xref>. A reduction of cytokine release was also observed after treatment with SR31747A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Gannon1">[13]</xref> and SSR125329A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Bourrie1">[14]</xref>, ligands for sigma receptors in models of rheumatoid arthritis and sepsis, respectively. Together, these studies suggest an involvement of sigma receptors in the inflammatory response after experimental stroke.</p>
      <p>The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate if short-term treatment with the highly specific Sig-1R agonist SA4503 affects mediators of inflammation in the ischemic hemisphere during the first week after experimental stroke.</p>

        <title>Transient Rat Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (tMCAO)</title>
        <p>Transient MCAO was induced as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Rickhag1">[16]</xref>. In brief, male Wistar rats (325–350 g, HsdBrlHan, Harlan Scandinavia, Denmark) were housed under diurnal light conditions and were fasted for 12 h before surgery. During surgery, physiological parameters were measured and controlled within physiological limits (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0045118-t001">Table 1</xref>). Rats were anesthetized (initial 4% fluothane in N<sub>2</sub>O/O<sub>2</sub> (70∶30), during surgery 2% fluothane in N<sub>2</sub>O/O<sub>2</sub>, Astra Zeneca, Sweden) and the right common carotid artery (CCA) and external carotid artery were occluded permanently, the internal carotid artery (ICA) was exposed and ligated. A nylon filament (top diameter 0.3–0.4 mm) was introduced into the ICA via a small incision into the distal end of the CCA and pleaded up to occlude the origin of the MCA. During occlusion, regional cerebral blood flow was monitored by an optical fiber probe (Probe 318-I, Perimed, Sweden) connected to a laser Doppler flowmeter (Periflux System 5000, Perimed, Sweden). After 2 h, the filament was withdrawn. The same procedure was performed in sham-operated animals but no filament was introduced into the ICA. In total, 40 rats were operated, thereof 7 animals died within the first 48 h before treatment start and one rat was excluded due to weight loss.</p>

        <title>Randomization and Treatment Protocols</title>
        <p>In order to obtain an experimental group with severe motor deficits, all animals were tested at 48 h after tMCAO for sensorimotor function on the rotating pole test and only rats with a severe deficit were randomly assigned into treatment groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Ruscher1">[17]</xref>. At this time point, the infarct development has subsided. Rats were excluded from the study if a score higher than 2 was obtained in the test. Sham operated rats were excluded if the test score was lower than 3. Randomization was carried out blinded for the investigators who performed the surgeries and behavioral tests. Every other rat received SA4503.</p>
        <p>Subsequently, starting on day 2 after MCAO, rats were injected daily with SA4503 (n = 12; 0.5 mg/kg bodyweight, s.c., AGY Therapeutics, South San Francisco, CA, USA) or vehicle (n = 10; saline) for 5 consecutive days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045118-g001">Figure 1</xref>), a dosage which has been demonstrated to improve lost neurological function after tMCAO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Ruscher2">[18]</xref>. In addition, 10 sham operated rats were injected (SA 0.5 mg/kg n = 5; vehicle n = 5) for the same time period.</p>

        <p>Microglia cell cultures were prepared from newborn rats (p2). After decapitation, meninges were removed from the tissue and cortices were mechanically dissected and digested in trypsin/EDTA solution (0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA) at 37°C for 15 min. Digestion was stopped by addition of Dulbeccós minimal essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine and 0.1% glucose (culture medium) and thereafter the tissue was dissociated with a glass pasteur pipette (PBS). After centrifugation at 260×g for 2 min, cells were resuspended in fresh culture medium and seeded in 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks. Cells were grown in culture medium and fed by complete medium change every third day. After 10 days, cultures were shaken for 1 h (250 rpm) in order to remove microglial cells.

      <p>Inflammation in the ischemic hemisphere significantly affects recovery of lost function following experimental stroke. The present study was conducted to assess if Sig-1R activation, by treatment with the specific agonist SA4503, affects the inflammatory response in the ischemic hemisphere. The findings we will discuss are: (1) Sig-1R activation does not affect the level of pro-inflammtory cytokines in the ischemic hemisphere and in microglia cultures after combined Hypoxia/Aglycemia. (2) SA4503 treatment enhances the levels of Iba1 in the infarct core after MCAO. (3) Effects of Sig-1R activation on neurodegeneration after MCAO.</p>

        <title>Effects of Sig-1R Activation on the Inflammatory Response After Stroke</title>
        <p>Our study confirms an inflammatory response in the ischemic hemisphere which strongly depends on the activation of resident and invading cells and the expression of pro-inflammtory molecules in the ischemic territory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Mitsios1">[24]</xref>. Results corroborate that treatment with SA4503 for five consecutive days is not accompanied with changes of levels of pro-inflammtory cytokines in the infarct core and adjacent peri-infarct area. Data are in discrepancy to studies showing a suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines upon Sig-1R activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Hall1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Gannon1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Bourrie1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Allahtavakoli1">[25]</xref>. In particular, reduced levels of TNF-α were found in <italic>in vitro</italic> models using macrophages (RAW 264.7 cell line) treated with the Sig-1R agonist SR31747A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Gannon1">[13]</xref> or isolated microglia treated with DTG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Hall1">[11]</xref> and acutely in the serum of mice treated with the Sig-1R specific agonist SSR125329A prior to a LPS challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Bourrie1">[14]</xref>. In additional <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments we compared the effect of SA4503 and DTG on nitrite production and the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β. While SA4503 did not affect inflammatory mediators, the application of DTG selectively reduced the levels of nitrite and TNF-α confirming data published previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Hall1">[11]</xref>. Together, these findings make it plausible that treatment with SA4503 essentially does not affect levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in experimental stroke models but rather is involved in the regulation of processes important for the beneficial effects observed at later time points after MCAO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Ruscher2">[18]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Microglia/macrophage Response in the Ischemic Hemispshere</title>
        <p>Microglia/macrophages but also other immune cells accumulate in the infarct core within the first days after experimental stroke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Gelderblom1">[26]</xref>. Multiple functions of those cells include the formation of a preliminary scar to seal the necrotic infarct tissue. Consequently, the microglial scar may prevent the diffusion of detrimental molecules which otherwise may cause secondary damage to the unaffected tissue resulting in an expansion of the infarct and secondary neuronal death. In addition, microglia/macrophages may participate in the regulation of the entry of peripheral immune cells in the ischemic territory.</p>
        <p>Previous studies have shown that highly proliferative Iba1/NG2 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan positive microglia/macrophage with phagocytotic properties are present in the infarct core <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Matsumoto1">[27]</xref>. We found that treatment with SA4503 causes a significant increase of Iba1, a specific marker of microglia/macrophage activation, in the infarct core confirming previous studies showing elevated Iba1 levels in the ischemic core after MCAO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Ito2">[22]</xref>. Iba1 has been identified as a calcium binding protein belonging to the EF-hand protein family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Imai1">[28]</xref>. In addition, its colocalization with F-actin upon stimulation with M-CSF in MG5 microglial cells indicates its involvement in mechanisms of cell motility and phagocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Ohsawa1">[29]</xref>. Activation of the Sig-1R together with elevated levels of Iba1 in microglia/macrophages in the ischemic core of SA4503 treated animals might be important for the intracellular calcium homeostais <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Ito1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Farber1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Hayashi2">[31]</xref>. However, it remains to be determined if the proposed mechanism contributes to motility of activated microglia/macrophages by inhibition of processes such as membrane ruffling and thus filopodia movements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Kanazawa1">[32]</xref>. Also, Iba1 only serves as an indirect marker protein of microglia/macrophage activation and can not be used to differentiate microglia/macrophage populations which are involved in different processes such as the expression of trophic factors, phagocytosis or the involvement in the inflammatory response after stroke.</p>
        <p>In addition, our results show that activation of the Sig-1R does not change the levels of PCNA, a general and established marker protein associated with cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Kanazawa1">[32]</xref>, in the ischemic hemisphere indicating that the number of proliferating microglia/macrophages are unaffected by SA4503 treatment. Similar levels for OX-42 also indicate that the average number of cells is similar among the treatment groups and that SA4503 treatment does not affect the number of microglia/macrophages in the ischemic territory, although we can not exclude that the overall distributon of immune cell populations expressing OX-42 has been changed by the treatment. Our findings are different to results obtained by treatment with the unspecific Sig-1R agonist DTG decreased the number of OX-42<sup>+</sup> cells in the ischemic territory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Takasaki1">[33]</xref>. The reduction in the number of OX-42<sup>+</sup> cells, however, might be due to a reduced infarct size as well as different experimental designs.</p>

        <title>Neurodegeneration and Activation of Sig-1R</title>
        <p>Our findings show that infarct volume is not affected by SA4503 treatment. Our results also indicate that treatment with SA4503 after experimental stroke requires a prolonged period of treatment time to achieve a significant improvement of lost neurological function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Ruscher2">[18]</xref>. Our findings are in contrast to previous investigations showing that delayed administration of the non-selective Sig-1R agonist 1,3-di-o-tolyguanidine (DTG) significantly decreases neurodegeneration after MCAO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Ajmo1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Leonardo1">[34]</xref>. Hence, the discrepancy might not be contradictory and be explained by different treatment windows and modes of actions of the compounds. 1,3-dio-tolylguanidine (DTG) is an unspecific sigma receptor agonist with similar binding affinity to the sigma-1 receptor and the sigma-2 receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Lever1">[35]</xref>. Therefore, further studies are needed to investigate if the short term neuroprotective effects after MCAO are mediated via activation of the sigma-1 receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Maurice1">[36]</xref>. DTG was administered 24 h after MCAO, we started treatment at day two following MCAO with the rationale not to effectuate cell death mechanisms rather than mechanisms of recovery in the ischemic territory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Ruscher2">[18]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In addition, 1,3-di-o-tolyguanidine is known for an induction of hypothermia in rats which is partially inhibited by specific sigma receptor antagonists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045118-Bejanian1">[37]</xref> and neuroprotective effects might be due to hypothermia induced in treated rats. Although we have not tested body temperature during the treatment period, it might have been that treatment with SA4503 has induced hypothermia. Nevertheless, beyond the period of neuroprotection hypothermia does not affect mechanisms involved in neuronal cell death. Therefore, it is likely that hypothermia induced by SA4503 treatment has no effect on recovery of lost neurological function after MCAO.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, treatment with SA4503 had no effect on levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the infarct core and adjacent peri-infarct region but resulted in a significant increase in Iba1 expression in the infarct core. We conclude that treatment with SA4503 does not directly affect the classic inflammatory response in the ischemic hemisphere following experimental stroke but may be involved in mechanisms of microglia/macrophage motility and phagocytosis.</p>
