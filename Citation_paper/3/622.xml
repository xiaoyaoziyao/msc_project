<title>Objective</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to examine the course of time-dependent evolution of HIV-1 subtype A on a global level, especially with respect to the dynamics of immunogenic HIV gag epitopes.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We used a total of 1,893 HIV-1 subtype A gag sequences representing a timeline from 1985 through 2010, and 19 different countries in Africa, Europe and Asia. The phylogenetic relationship of subtype A gag and its epidemic dynamics was analysed through a Maximum Likelihood tree and Bayesian Skyline plot, genomic variability was measured in terms of G→A substitutions and Shannon entropy, and the time-dependent evolution of HIV subtype A gag epitopes was examined. Finally, to confirm observations on globally reported HIV subtype A sequences, we analysed the gag epitope data from our Kenyan, Pakistani, and Afghan cohorts, where both cohort-specific gene epitope variability and HLA restriction profiles of gag epitopes were examined.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>The most recent common ancestor of the HIV subtype A epidemic was estimated to be 1956±1. A period of exponential growth began about 1980 and lasted for approximately 7 years, stabilized for 15 years, declined for 2–3 years, then stabilized again from about 2004. During the course of evolution, a gradual increase in genomic variability was observed that peaked in 2005–2010. We observed that the number of point mutations and novel epitopes in gag also peaked concurrently during 2005–2010.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>It appears that as the HIV subtype A epidemic spread globally, changing population immunogenetic pressures may have played a role in steering immune-evolution of this subtype in new directions. This trend is apparent in the genomic variability and epitope diversity of HIV-1 subtype A gag sequences.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Under selection pressures from host immunity, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) rapidly mutates, which allows the amplification of escape mutations that enables the virus to evade the host's immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Brumme1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Moore1">[3]</xref>. Sequences of HIV-1 subtype A that were first deposited in the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) HIV Sequence Database were of African origin, from mid-80s. In subsequent years, as subtype A viruses were disseminated globally, sequences from different parts of world were made available in the LANL database. In the past few decades, HIV-1 subtype A has established itself in certain regions of the world including Kenya, Uganda, Japan, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Botswana, Belarus, Congo, and recently, Afghanistan and Pakistan (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/</ext-link>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Ansari1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Khan1">[5]</xref>. Analysis of the evolutionary patterns of a virus in the context of its host populations sheds light on the selection pressures on viruses that are associated with specific host immune milieus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Novitsky1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Taylor1">[7]</xref>. This type of information is useful in designing vaccines and drugs against the virus.</p>
<p>In the current study, taking into account the sequences from years 1985 to 2010, we have analysed the divergence and evolution of HIV gag. We focus on both time-dependent as well as cohort-specific evolution of the HIV-1 subtype A gag gene, and present an analysis of evolutionary dynamics of HIV-1 subtype A on a global level, especially with respect to the evolution of gag epitopes.</p>

<title>HIV-1 Subtype A Sequences</title>
<p>A total of 1,893 HIV-1 subtype A gag (spanning the p24 and p2p7p1p6 gene regions) DNA sequences from 19 countries (Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda, Sweden, Cyprus, Democratic Republic of Congo, Belarus, Tanzania, Russia, China, Ukraine, Italy, Australia, South Africa, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Spain, Zambia, Cameroon) were included in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093415.s001">Table S1</xref>).

<title>HLA analysis of samples from Kenyan, Pakistani and Afghan cohort</title>
<p>Patient blood samples from our previously published cohorts in Kenya, Pakistan, and Afghanistan were collected after obtaining written informed consent. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Ethical Review Committee, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan. Using DNA samples from 94 Kenyan, Pakistani and Afghan patients, exons 2 and 3 of HLA class-I loci HLA-A, -B, and -C were amplified by PCR, based on the protocol described by <italic>Bettinotti, et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Bettinotti1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Abidi1">[12]</xref>. Approximately a 1 kb DNA fragment was amplified for each locus using exon-specific primers. Three different pairs of primers (HLA-A locus: <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′TTCTCCCCAGACGCCGAGGATGGCC3′</named-content>, and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′TGTTGGTCCCAATTGTCTCCCCTC3′</named-content>; HLA-B locus: <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′ACCCACCCGGACTCAGAATCTCCT3′</named-content>, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′GGAGGCCATCCCCGGCGACCTAT3′</named-content>, and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′GGAGGCCATCCCCGGCGATCTAT3′</named-content>; HLA-C locus: <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′GAGAAGCCAATCAGCGTCTCCGCA3′</named-content>, and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′GGAGATGGGGAAGGCTCCCCACT3′</named-content>) were used for amplification of the region extending from 50-untranslated region (50-UTR) to the third exon of the HLA gene locus on human chromosome six <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Bettinotti1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Abidi1">[12]</xref>.

<title>Collection and year-wise grouping of HIV-I Subtype A sequences</title>
<p>From a total of 1,893 sequences, the oldest HIV-1 subtype A gag sequence was from 1985 (Uganda), while the most recent sequences were from 2010. These sequences were divided into five groups, all but one representing a 5-year block of sequences; the last block, 2005–2010, covered 6 years (inclusive of years 2005 and 2010). These groups were: 1985–1990, 1990–1995, 1995–2000, 2000–2005, and 2005–2010, comprising 133, 131, 1262, 198, and 169 sequences, respectively. All sequences were aligned using <italic>MEGA5</italic> software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Tamura1">[14]</xref> and trimmed to a length of 447 bp. Unless stated otherwise, for all analyses performed, the same grouping of sequences was maintained.</p>

<title>Phylogenetic Analysis</title>
<p>Evolutionary relationships among the HIV-1 subtype A sequences were analysed using a Maximum likelihood (ML) tree, constructed with 1,893 subtype A gag sequences using <italic>MEGA5</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Tamura1">[14]</xref>. For the ML tree, the following parameters were used: substitution model – GTR; rates among sites – Gamma distributed with Invariant sites (G+I); number of discrete gamma categories – 5 (default value); ML heuristic method – Nearest-Neighbor-Interchange (NNI); initial tree for ML – NJ/BioNJ; test of phylogeny – bootstap (100 replicates). For this analysis, the SIV<sub>cpz</sub> gag sequence from 1988 (Accession number: X52154) was used as outgroup to root the tree. The ML tree was refined using <italic>FigTree</italic> v1.3.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/" xlink:type="simple">http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/</ext-link>) software. The software artificially compresses the tree to fit in large number of sequences.</p>

<title>Effective population size and time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA)</title>
<p>A Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference was applied to estimate the effective population size and tMRCA of HIV subtype A, using <italic>BEAST</italic> v1.7.4 software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Drummond1">[15]</xref>. For this analysis, a total of 113 sequences from different countries from 1985 to 2010 were used. Sequences were selected using the approach described by <italic>Novitsky, et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Novitsky1">[6]</xref>, where a limit was set to 5–6 sequences per country and year-groups. If 5 or less sequences were represented in a country all of them were included in the analysis. Bayesian analysis was performed using the following parameters: uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Drummond2">[16]</xref>, general time-reversible (GTR) nucleotide substitution model, estimated base frequencies, and gamma distribution model for heterogeneity among nucleotide sites. The analysis was performed using demographic models of constant population size and Bayesian skyline plot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Drummond3">[17]</xref>. The MCMC chain length was set at 2×10<sup>8</sup>, which gave an effective sample size (ESS) of &gt;200. MCMC sample analysis and Bayesian skyline plot construction were performed using <italic>Tracer</italic> v1.7.4. In a separate experiment, in order to control the effect of high G→A substitutions on effective population size and tMRCA, all sequences with high G→A substitutions (mostly Afghan and Pakistani sequences) were removed and the Bayesian analysis was performed again.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2f">
<title>Time-dependent genomic variability</title>
<p>In order to evaluate time-dependent changes in HIV subtype A genomic variability, G→A substitutions and Shannon entropy analyses were performed. The Shannon entropy of subtype A gag gene sequences from the five different year-groups was calculated with as well as without the sequences from our three cohorts, using an online tool available at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) HIV Sequence Database: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/</ext-link> sequence/ENTROPY/entropy_one.html.</p>
<p>G→A substitution analysis of the HIV sequences was performed using Hypermut (both 2.0 and old versions) tool available at the LANL HIV Sequence Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HYPERMUT/hypermut.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HYPERMUT/hypermut.html</ext-link>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Rose1">[18]</xref>. For this analysis, HIV subtype A reference sequences from years 1985, 1992, and 2003 were retrieved from LANL HIV Sequence Database and were used as follows: 1985 sequence was used for the year group 1985–1990, 1992 sequence for year-groups 1990–1995 and 1995–2000, and 2003 sequence for 2000–2005 and 2005–2010 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Yang1">[19]</xref>. Since a reference sequence for year 2005 through 2010 was not available in the LANL database, the 2003 reference sequence was used for 2000–2005 as well as for 2005–2010 block. The values for each step (G→A substitutions and Shannon entropy) were entered into the <italic>GraphPad</italic> software to determine the mean for each group, while statistical significance between year-wise groups was calculated using one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test, using <italic>GraphPad</italic> software.</p>

<title>Prediction of CTL epitopes and HLA restriction</title>
<p>Consensus gag <italic>gene</italic> sequences for each year-group were translated into amino acid sequences using <italic>Expasy</italic> translate tool. These protein sequences were then used to predict CD8+ T cell epitopes using <italic>CTLPred</italic> software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Bhasin1">[20]</xref>. A similar strategy was used to predict CD8+ T cell epitopes in sequences from Kenyan, Pakistani and Afghan cohorts. Additionally, for sequences from our study cohorts, the MHC restriction for each epitope was predicted using <italic>ProPred-I</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Singh1">[21]</xref> and <italic>nHLAPred</italic> software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Bhasin2">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>Since HLA data was available for our three study cohorts, population and allele frequencies of HLA for these cohorts were calculated using online HLA frequency tool available at Los Alamos website (Los Alamos National Laboratory, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hiv.lanl.gov" xlink:type="simple">http://www.hiv.lanl.gov</ext-link>). This tool computes the 2-sided exact Fisher's p-value for each HLA in a given population. False discovery was corrected by Storey's q-value. HLA alleles were represented in the Kenyan, Afghan and Pakistani cohorts with a frequency of 10% or above were marked as ‘predominant HLA alleles’ in the three cohorts.</p>
<p>Sequences from our three study cohorts were part of 2005–2010 year-group, when analysis for genetic variability (i.e., G→A substitutions and Shannon entropy) and epitope prediction was carried out. To confirm whether observations for genetic variability and immunodynamics analysis were also reflected in a population-specific manner, sequences from these three cohorts were also analysed separately.</p>

<title>Analysis of the phylogenetic relationships, origin, and global epidemic dynamics of HIV-1 subtype A</title>
<p>Phylogenetic relationships among the HIV subtype A gag sequences were inferred through a Maximum Likelihood (ML) tree. For this analysis, an SIV<sub>cpz</sub> gag sequence was used as an outgroup to root the ML tree. Analysis of the tree structure revealed that HIV-1 subtype A gag sequences from the different year-groups were scattered throughout the phylogenetic tree, without any apparent relationship between branching topology and time of sampling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093415-g001">Figure 1</xref>). There are significant clusters in the tree supported by bootstrap values greater than 70%. However, since 90% of the sequences in the tree are from Kenya, these clusters likely represent some Kenya transmission networks. However, there was one significant cluster in the tree that was comprised of sequences from just Pakistan and Afghanistan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093415-g001">Figure 1</xref>, green shaded square).</p>

<p>To explore the relationship between gag divergence and epidemic dynamics, Bayesian Skyline analysis was performed. Using this analysis, the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of HIV-1 subtype A was estimated to be around 1956±1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093415-g002">Figure 2</xref>, black dotted line). Compared to the origin of tMRCA, the Bayesian Skyline plot identified at least an initial 10-fold growth in viral effective population size (correlating with effective number of infections and/or transmission opportunities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Frost1">[23]</xref>) during the early to mid-1980s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093415-g002">Figure 2</xref>, red area). Effective population size became stationary from the mid-to-late 1980s until the early 2000s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093415-g002">Figure 2</xref>, blue area), followed by a period of decline, where an approximate 3-fold decrease was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093415-g002">Figure 2</xref>, green area). The effective population size became stationary from about 2004 onwards. Sequences with high G→A substitutions can introduce bias in the Skyline analysis by introducing noise in the overall data. To control for the effect of high G→A substitutions on the overall effective population size and tMRCA, in a separate analysis all sequences with high G→A substitutions were removed and Bayesian analysis was performed again. The resulting Skyline plots, and tMRCA were found to be similar to the one where sequences with high G→A substitutions were retained in the analysis (data not shown).</p>

<title>Time-dependent genetic evolution of HIV subtype A gag</title>
<p>In order to analyse HIV-1 subtype A gag variability over the study period, we performed G→A substitutions and Shannon entropy analysis on subtype A gag sequences grouped into five 5-year sets. It was observed that during the first ten years of the epidemic (1985–1995), G→A substitutions were at a low level with a mean of about two substitutions per sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093415-g003">Figure 3a</xref>)., A significant (p&lt;0.001) increase in G→A substitutions was observed from 1995 though 2000 compared to the earlier time-periods, which continued into the last five years (2005–2010) of epidemic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093415-g003">Figure 3a</xref>). Shannon entropy analysis revealed a significant (p&lt;0.001) increase in entropy from years 1985–90 to 1990–95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093415-g003">Figure 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093415-g003">Figure 3b</xref> insert), followed by a plateau phase until 2005, when the change in entropy was non-significant. Compared to all other year-groups, the last six years (2005–10) were marked by a sharp, significant (p&lt;0.001) increase in entropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093415-g003">Figure 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093415-g003">Figure 3b</xref> inset). It was interesting to note that this increase in entropy was most profound in the p2p7p1p6 region of HIV-1 gag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093415-g003">Figure 3b</xref>, blue peaks).</p>

<p>To analyse the diversity of gag epitopes in the three cohorts, the number of CTL epitopes, their HLA restriction profile, and epitope variability (total number of mutations in all epitope sequences in a given cohort/total number of epitopes in a cohort) was evaluated. In Pakistani, Afghan, and Kenyan cohorts, respectively, 10, 10, and 11 unique gag epitopes were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093415-g005">Figure 5c</xref>). The repertoire of epitopes was identical between Pakistani and Afghan cohort, while distinct from those in the Kenyan cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093415-g005">Figure 5c</xref>). Since a major portion of the HIV sequences from the Pakistani and Afghan cohorts are phylogenetically closely linked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093415-g001">Figure 1</xref>), observing a high degree of similarity in their epitope pattern was not surprising. Furthermore, since sequences in the 2005–2010-year group were predominantly from these three cohorts, the epitope profile of this year-group considerably overlapped with that of the three cohorts (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093415-g005">Figure 5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093415.s002">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, using all 1,893 sequences from the HIV-1 subtype A gag p24 and p2p7p1p6 region submitted to the LANL HIV Sequence Database, representing 19 countries and years 1985 through 2010, we examined the time-dependent evolution of HIV-1 subtype A. Out of these sequences, 94 were from our Afghan, Kenyan and Pakistani cohorts, and we used these sequences to perform population-specific immunodynamics of HIV-1 subtype A gag gene region. Our analysis was specifically focused on the genetic variability and epitope diversity in this gene region.</p>
<p>Phylogenetic analysis revealed that HIV-1 subtype A gag sequences from different year-groups were dispersed throughout the tree suggesting on-going evolution or diversification of the virus throughout the epidemic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Novitsky1">[6]</xref>. While we identified dispersed, significant clusters of sequences throughout the tree, most of the sequences (about 90%) in our analysis were from Kenya – which most likely skewed the overall phylogeny to reflect Kenyan transmission clusters. We also found that the majority of sequences from Afghanistan and Pakistan (year group 2005–10), grouped together in a single monophyletic cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093415-g001">Figure 1</xref>, green highlight). Clustering of Afghan and Pakistani sequences reflects the close relationship between the subtype A epidemic in the two countries, as evident from our previously published data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Ansari1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Abidi2">[26]</xref>. The HIV strains in Afghan refugees and Pakistani HIV-infected communities share phylogenetic relationship most likely because the routes of transmission of infection are the same between Pakistani patients and the Afghan refugees residing in Pakistan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Ansari1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Abidi2">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>Bayesian analysis indicated that the most recent common ancestor of what we call HIV-1 subtype A viruses arose about 1956. Based on effective population size, from 1956 until about 1980, there was a low and stable level (effective population size: 1×10<sup>1.5</sup>) of HIV transmissions. Beginning in 1980, there was a rapid, epidemic-level expansion of HIV-infections which peaked about 1987 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Frost1">[23]</xref>. Following by a stationary phase or stabilization of the epidemic that lasted until early 2000, followed by a short period of decline until about 2004, after which the epidemic began to plateau once again.</p>
<p>HIV gag genetic variability (measured using G→A substitutions and entropy) during the first 10 years (1985–95) of the epidemic increased significantly (p&lt;0.001) from the mid-1990s onwards, eventually reaching a peak between 2000–2010. This trend was also observed for subtype A gag epitope patterns where novel epitopes and epitope mutations reached a peak between 2005–2010.</p>
<p>Following HIV-1 infection, the host immune system strives to control the viral load, while the virus struggles to escape the host defence by incorporating immune escape mutations into its genome, driven by selection pressures, resulting in increased variability in the viral genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Abidi3">[27]</xref>. The parameters for measuring genetic variability used in this study were Shannon entropy and G→A substitutions. Shannon entropy is a measure of the probability of acquiring mutations, including epitope-related mutations, in a given set of genomic sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Abidi3">[27]</xref>. On the other hand, G→A substitutions, introduced into the viral genome by the host's secondary viral control factors, such as APOBEC protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Abidi3">[27]</xref>, also contribute to the genetic variability of the virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Jern1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>Evaluation of epidemic dynamics and genetic variability helps in determining the course of viral evolution. The decrease observed in viral effective population size after 2004, combined with an increase in gag gene and epitope variability from 2005 onwards might be reflective of subtype A strains in populations with immunogenetic backgrounds that may increase the amount of immunological escape mutations while negatively affecting viral replication fitness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Matthews1">[29]</xref>. For instance, it may be an indication of the introduction of subtype A viruses in populations having a predominance of protective alleles, such as HLA B*51 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Zhang1">[30]</xref>, as observed in the Afghan and Pakistani populations we studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Ansari1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Khan1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Khanani2">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093415-Khanani3">[25]</xref>, where HLA data was available. The observed variability in the gag gene, as well as in the epitope pattern, could be driven, in part, by the varying HLA backdrops the viruses encountered as the HIV epidemic travelled through different populations. In addition, continuing HIV evolution over time, as well as founder effects arising from the introduction of new, unique subtype A strains within a population, also contribute to diversity in gag. This was especially apparent in our three cohort analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093415-g005">Figures 5a and 5b</xref>). For example, epitope LG<underline>A</underline>GATLEE, observed in Kenyan cohort, was predicted to be restricted by HLA A*24/C*04/B*27. This epitope was mutated to LG<underline>T</underline>GATLEE in Pakistani and Afghan cohorts, changing the predicted restriction to HLA A*68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093415-g005">Figure 5c</xref>, grey highlighted rows).</p>
<p>A relatively high value of sequence entropy and epitope variation observed in Pakistani, Afghan and Kenyan sequences in the years 2005–2010 may indicate a transient phase in the virus' genetic evolution, which may later be followed by a refinement and amplification of discreet escape mutants, which is probably indicated by the stabilization in viral effective population size observed from about 2004 onwards. Keeping in mind the limited number of sequences available from 2004-onwards, it is likely that this analysis represents an incomplete picture of the status of epidemic from 2004 onwards. As more subtype A sequences from this period become available, similar analyses will give a better insight into how the genetic and immunological pressures will shape the HIV epidemics in the upcoming years.</p>
<p>A year-wise analysis of epitope sequences from the same populations will help in deciphering the true nature of this phenomenon. Further analyses will provide a better understanding of the directions in which the HIV-1 epidemics continue to evolve. This information will be crucial in anticipating prevention and control strategies for subtype A-infected patients, especially in populations where the epidemic is newly emerging.</p>
