        <p>The mammalian intestine harbors a vast, complex and dynamic microbial population, which has profound effects on host nutrition, intestinal function and immune response, as well as influence on physiology outside of the alimentary tract. Imbalance in the composition of the dense colonizing bacterial population can increase susceptibility to various acute and chronic diseases. Valuable insights on the association of the microbiota with disease critically depend on investigation of mouse models. Like in humans, the microbial community in the mouse intestine is relatively stable and resilient, yet can be influenced by environmental factors. An often-overlooked variable in research is basic animal husbandry, which can potentially alter mouse physiology and experimental outcomes. This study examined the effects of common husbandry practices, including food and bedding alterations, as well as facility and cage changes, on the gut microbiota over a short time course of five days using three culture-independent techniques, quantitative PCR, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) and next generation sequencing (NGS). This study detected a substantial transient alteration in microbiota after the common practice of a short cross-campus facility transfer, but found no comparable alterations in microbiota within 5 days of switches in common laboratory food or bedding, or following an isolated cage change in mice acclimated to their housing facility. Our results highlight the importance of an acclimation period following even simple transfer of mice between campus facilities, and highlights that occult changes in microbiota should be considered when imposing husbandry variables on laboratory animals.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>A complex non-random community of colonizing microbes, termed microbiota, inhabits skin and mucosal surfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Costello1">[1]</xref>. Humans and other animals have coevolved with these microbes so as to not only tolerate, but also to require their presence for health and normal physiology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Hooper1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Zaneveld1">[4]</xref>. In turn, the host provides the microbes a beneficial environment, creating a mutualistic relationship <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Hooper1">[2]</xref>. In the last decade, a combination of culture-independent experimental approaches and rapid advances in DNA sequence technologies have contributed to a wealth of knowledge on the composition and function of the microbiota <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Handelsman1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Gordon1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Microbial abundance and diversity are particularly striking in the mammalian intestine. While four kingdoms are represented in this community of colonizing microbes, the most abundant, and chief focus of investigations to date, are the bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Reyes1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Palmer1">[11]</xref>. The mammalian intestine harbors a complex bacterial community of at least 1,000 species, comprised mostly of members of the phyla <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> and <italic>Firmicutes</italic>. The <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> are Gram-negative bacteria, including numerous <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, <italic>Cytophaga</italic>, and <italic>Flavobacterium</italic> species, while the intestinal <italic>Firmicutes</italic> are Gram-positive bacteria, such as members of the <italic>Enterococcaceae</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic> families and the <italic>Clostridia</italic> class. Together, these taxa account for ninety percent or more of the nearly hundred-trillion bacteria in the gut. By harboring a vast, diverse, and dynamic bacterial population in the gut, the host acquires access to an enormous collection of microbial genes (a metagenome), encoding proteins and enzymes that aid in digestion, produce essential vitamins and nutrients, enhance intestinal development, and prime the intestinal immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Ley1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Hooper2">[12]</xref>. The dynamic and intimate interactions between the host and its intestinal microbiota can have effects beyond the intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Gordon1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Hooper2">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-OHara1">[15]</xref>. The microbiota can even affect neurobiological and behavioral phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Gonzalez1">[16]</xref>. Some have used the term “the forgotten organ” to describe the gut microbiome, because it functions in such diverse physiological processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-OHara1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Dysbiosis, the alteration or imbalance in the microbiota, can create a niche for proliferation of virulent organisms to disrupt homeostasis and cause disease. However, even in the absence of overt pathogens, an imbalance can be detrimental to the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Chow1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Chow2">[17]</xref>. A variety of environmental influences, as well as genetic host factors can cause dysbiosis, dramatically increasing susceptibility to acute infectious diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Sekirov1">[18]</xref> and to chronic inflammatory diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Packey1">[19]</xref>, including obesity, diabetes, gastrointestinal cancers, atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and asthma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Turnbaugh1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Hill1">[30]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Mice are the most widely used species to model acute and chronic disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Malakoff1">[31]</xref>. Many valuable insights on the association of the microbiota with disease stem from, and depend on, investigation of mouse models. As with humans, the gut microbial community in mice is relatively stable and resilient. Nevertheless, environment can influence the microbiota. Basic animal husbandry is an often-overlooked variable in research that can potentially alter experimental outcomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Schellinck1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Gurfein1">[33]</xref>. Despite a wide appreciation that husbandry practices influence the microbiota <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Bleich1">[34]</xref>, the specific contributions of routine practices are not well understood. This study examined the effects of food and bedding alterations, as well as the common husbandry practices of facility and cage changes, on the microbiota over a short time course of five days. Above the other variables, we report here that a simple intracampus facility and cage change has a significant, but previously unappreciated impact on the gut microbiota.</p>

        <p>All procedures were performed under a protocol approved by the UC Davis IACUC. Mice were housed according to the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. FVB mice, 7–10 weeks of age, were reared in a specific pathogen free (SPF) barrier facility and transferred to a conventional housing facility on day zero. Mice were maintained on a 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle at 30–70% humidity and at 70–72°F ambient temperature. All animals were given free access to food and water, and were housed in same sex pairs in static micro-isolator cages. Water was purified using the Edstrom water acidification system (Edstrom Industries, Inc, Waterford, WI) with a pH in the range of 2–3, checked at time of bottle filling with monthly quality control testing for pH accuracy and bacterial growth. All cages and bedding were autoclaved according to institutional guidelines prior to animals being placed into them. Pathogen monitoring in the conventional housing facility utilized a sentinel program with quarterly screens to ensure the health of the animals. All testing of rodent sentinels in the housing rooms were negative through out the duration of the study. To assure strict consistency, one investigator (BWM) assumed all care, handling and maintenance of mice during the experimental protocol. Cage changes were made as indicated in the specific experiments in adherence to institutional guidelines and to mimic normal husbandry procedures.</p>
        <p>The experimental groups of mice used in this study were: “group 1”) Bedding change: mice (n = 6, 2F/4M) were changed from corncob bedding (Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) to Carefresh bedding (Carefresh, Canon City, CO); “group 2”) Food change: mice (n = 8, 4F/4M) were changed from Harlan Teklad 2918 (Harlan) to Purina Lab Diet 5058 (MI Nutrition International LLC (LabDiet), St. Louis, MO); “group 3”) Control: mice (n = 8, 4F/4M) were housed on corncob bedding and maintained on Harlan Teklad 2918 diet; “group 4”) High fat diet change: mice (n = 8, 4F/4M) were changed from Purina Lab Diet 5058 to a 20% high fat diet by Open Source Diets (Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ). Fresh fecal samples were collected just prior to the facility/cage change (day 0), and then daily for 5 days thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047416-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). After the facility/cage change on day 0, no further change in bedding, food or cage was made for any of the mice, and fecal material and waste was allowed to accumulate for the remainder of the 5-day experiment. Thus, mice in Group 3 (controls) experienced a facility/cage change on day zero, placing them in a new cage with fresh bedding and food, but were maintained on otherwise identical corncob bedding and Harlan Teklad 2918 diet.</p>

            <p>A) Timeline of experimental approach. Fresh fecal samples were collected daily at each time point from individual mice (downward arrows). Day 0 denotes baseline samples obtained just prior to transfer from an SPF facility to a conventional housing facility (upward block arrow). Upon transfer, either bedding (group 1) or food (group 2) was changed (from corncob to Carefresh bedding, and Teklad 2918 to LabDiet 5058, respectively). Control mice (group 3) were also transferred and placed in a fresh cage, but maintained on the same type of food and bedding (corncob and Teklad 2918). Day 1 is 24 hours after the combined facility transfer/cage change for all mice. B) Principal coordinate analysis of Eubacterial-TRFLP data. Each data point represents a single mouse specimen at days 0 (yellow squares), 1 (black circles) and 5 (blue triangles) from mice in three experimental groups: bedding change (n = 6), food change (n = 8) and control (n = 8). A PCoA was performed using all data, and then graphed for each of the three experimental groups separately.</p>

        <p>A second independent cohort of mice (“group 5”, n = 7, 3F/4M) were similarly transported from the same SPF facility as the first group, but were placed in a different conventional housing location. Like Group 3, this cohort of mice was also housed on corncob bedding and maintained on Harlan Teklad 2918 diet. They remained in the conventional housing facility for 37 days to assess the effects of cage changes in acclimated mice (without concomitant facility change). During this time, cages were changed (by BMW) on days 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28, as part of normal husbandry. Fresh fecal pellets were collected daily and TRFLP analysis was performed on samples collected on day 0 (just prior to the facility/cage change), day 1, day 5, days 7 and 21 (just before routine cage changes), days 8 and 22 (one day after routine cage changes), and on days 12 and 26 (five days after routine cage changes).</p>

        <p>Fecal pellets were freshly collected from each mouse daily in the early morning after timed lighting was turned on. Fecal pellets were promptly weighed and suspended in RNAlater (Ambion Life Technologies, San Diego, CA). The fecal samples in RNAlater were incubated overnight at room temperature and then stored at −80°C until processed for DNA extraction, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Salzman1">[35]</xref>.</p>

        <title>DNA Extraction</title>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>To investigate how husbandry variables might influence microbiota, mice reared in a SPF barrier facility were transferred across campus to a conventional housing facility and assigned to group 1 (bedding change), group 2 (food change) or group 3 (control). At day 0, all mice were placed in a new cage to commence the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047416-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, see Materials and Methods for precise details). Fresh fecal samples were collected just prior to the facility/cage change (day 0), and then daily for 5 days thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047416-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Bacterial DNA was extracted from the stool samples for Eubacterial-TRFLP and qPCR analysis. A principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plot of the TRFLP data was generated to analyze changes in composition of the microbiota in mice from each experimental group at three time points, days 0, 1, and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047416-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Each data point represents analysis of the microbiota of an individual mouse at a specific time point and provides an unbiased measure of variation of one sample compared to all others in this experiment. The PCoA plots show a striking alteration in the composition of microbiota at day 1, following the initial facility transfer and cage change. This alteration of the microbiota is evident as a shift from a diffuse scatter of data points at day 0 to a tightly clustered pattern at day 1 in all three groups. At day 5, the PCoA plots for all animals in each group showed a return to approximate the original diffuse pattern seen at day 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047416-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Contrary to our expectations, the PCoA indicated that the bedding and diet changes had a negligible effect on the microbiota. Rather, the analysis showed that mice in all three groups manifested a similar reshaping of their microbiota composition at day 1, indicating a significant influence of the habitat change on the microbiota.</p>
      <p>A taxonomic plot of the TRFLP data assesses operational taxonomic units and proportions of these bacteria present in each sample. Analysis of individual taxonomic groups at day 1 shows an apparent disappearance of <italic>Lactobacillales</italic> in 21 of 22 mice with a concomitant expansion of the family <italic>Flavobacteraceae</italic> and class <italic>Clostridia</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047416-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). By day 5 the microbial population diversifies to resemble the day 0 pattern, including a return of the <italic>Lactobacillales</italic> taxon in all three experimental groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047416-g002">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>

      <p>A similar pattern of change was also observed in an independent experiment with a separate cohort of seven mice, and while <italic>Lactobacillales</italic> decreased in abundance at day 1 in this experiment, their reduced numbers remained detectable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0047416.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). The abundance of Lactobacilli in stool at days 0, 1 and 5 was compared using repeated measures ANOVA. For the 8 mice in group 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047416-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, mice A–H) the mean relative proportions of Lactobacilli at these time points were 28%, 0% and 29%, respectively (p&lt;0.001), and for the 7 mice in the supplementary group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0047416.s001">Fig. S1</xref>) these mean proportions were 15%, 7.4% and 17%, respectively (p&lt;0.05). Thus, in both of these independent experiments we observed a significant transient decrease in Lactobacilli following the facility/cage cage.</p>
      <p>To quantify select bacterial populations in each sample from groups 1–3, real-time qPCR of the microbiota was analyzed. Quantification of select bacterial populations, normalized to a universal bacterial assay, <italic>Eubacterium</italic>, substantiated that significant differences existed for individual mice between day 0 and day 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0047416.s002">Fig. S2A</xref>). A comparison of the mice in groups 1–3 at day 5 did not detect any significant differences in bacterial populations attributable to either the food or bedding changes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0047416.s002">Fig. S2B</xref>). The profile proportions were indistinguishable as compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0047416.s002">Fig. S2C</xref>), consistent with the PCoA and taxonomic analysis of TRFLP data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047416-g001">Figs. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047416-g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0047416.s001">S1</xref>).</p>
      <p>It was somewhat unexpected that we did not detect a statistically significant difference in microbiota when the mouse diet was changed from Harlan Teklad 2918 to Purina Lab Diet 5058 (group 2). Therefore, to address whether our approach could detect an altered microbiota at day 5 following a dietary change previously reported by other laboratories to alter microbiota <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Hildebrandt1">[48]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Turnbaugh2">[50]</xref>, animals were switched from a standard maintenance rodent chow to a specially formulated high-fat diet, consisting of ∼20% crude fat (group 4). After 5 days, stool microbiota was analyzed by PCoA of TRFLP data. Control animals maintained on the standard diet (n = 7), displayed a similar diffuse pattern at both day 0 and 5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0047416.s003">Fig. S3A</xref>). In contrast, microbiota of mice switched to a high fat diet showed a dramatic shift along PC1 from the diffuse pattern at day 0 to a cluster at day 5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0047416.s003">Fig. S3B</xref>). This pattern is seen in mice whether they were on corncob or Carefresh bedding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0047416.s003">Fig. S3B</xref>). Consistent with previously published reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Hildebrandt1">[48]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Turnbaugh2">[50]</xref>, quantitative PCR analysis demonstrated a decrease in <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> and an increase in <italic>Firmicutes</italic> in the mice on a high fat diet (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0047416.s004">Fig. S4</xref>).</p>
      <p>To further interrogate the significant microbiota changes following the facility/cage change in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047416-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, we performed TRFLP analysis of stool samples from the control group (group 3) at days 2, 3 and 4. The dramatic loss of microbial diversity detected at day 1 was followed by a gradual return to resemble baseline by day 4, with <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> detected in most individuals at this time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047416-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). By day 5, the microbiota returned to the pattern observed at day 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047416-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>).

      <p>Finally, the composition of the microbiota in a group of mice that experienced a cage change, but without a change of housing facility was assessed by Eubacterial-TRFLP analysis of stool microbiota. A cohort of mice (group 5, n = 7), like before were transferred from a SPF barrier facility to a conventional housing facility and maintained on corncob bedding and Harlan Teklad 2918 diet for 37 days. Fresh stool was sampled daily and routine cage change was performed every seven days, per institutional policy. In this experiment, mice were allowed to acclimate after the day 0 facility change prior to assessing the effects of the cage change at day 7 and 22. Eubacterial-TRFLP analysis of individual taxonomic groups in stool sampled just prior to, and then 1- and 5-days following the routine changes showed no statistically significant differences in microbiota (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047416-g006">Fig. 6</xref>).

      <p>A healthy microbiota is essential for fitness of the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Hooper1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Zaneveld1">[4]</xref>; conversely, dysbiosis can promote illness by increasing the susceptibility to and/or persistence of disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Chow1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Chow2">[17]</xref>. Mouse models have been at the forefront of research to elucidate the mechanisms that link the composition of the microbiota with normal physiology or disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Sekirov1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Turnbaugh1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Hill1">[30]</xref>. Husbandry practices can potentially impact the composition of microbiota, and hence introduce variables into research studies and affect experimental outcomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Bleich1">[34]</xref>. Although often mentioned in the description of research methodology as an accepted assumption, surprisingly little has been published to systematically test the importance of these environmental variables on microbiota <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Hufeldt1">[51]</xref>. In this study, our data provide a glimpse into the significant changes of the intestinal microbiota that result from a simple “routine” intracampus facility change to a conventional animal facility.</p>
      <p>We observed a rather profound difference in the composition of the colonizing microbial community one day after the short facility transfer with its attendant cage change that gradually returned to approximate baseline composition by day 5. These data identify a previously unrecognized transient alteration in intestinal microbiota following the routine relocation and change of a mouse’s cage. The findings suggest that without an acclimation period, a “routine” facility change has potential importance in numerous scenarios, e.g. sampling of microbiota following introduction of experimental variables, timing of pathogen challenges, time-course of investigations probing metabolic dynamics, and perhaps analysis of behavioral phenotypes.</p>
      <p>The two variables that we tested at the outset - bedding and standard chow - showed no detectable effect on microbiota over the relatively short five-day time course in this study. It remains possible that these husbandry changes could have a significant effect on composition profiles over a longer time span. Likewise, it is possible that changes in abundance of members of the microbiota could have escaped our detection. Nevertheless, we did observe microbiota composition changes by day 5 upon switching mice to a high fat diet, consistent with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Turnbaugh1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Hildebrandt1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Ley3">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Turnbaugh3">[52]</xref>. Rather than further pursuing the possible nuances of these hypotheses, we focused attention to the striking aftereffects of a facility and cage change.</p>
      <p>From behavioral observations, mouse biologists have long recognized that change in environment is a stressful event for laboratory rodents. Because mice rely heavily on odors for communication, territorial marking, and control of sexual and aggressive behaviors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Hurst1">[53]</xref>, disrupting their environment has consequence on olfactory cues. In addition, coprophagy is necessary to provide many essential nutrients, including B vitamins, synthesized by bacteria in the distal intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Soave1">[54]</xref>. Together, the importance of olfaction and coprophagy in normal mouse biology suggests why the environmental upheaval imposed by facility change might have physiological repercussions. Cage changes, inter-facility transport, and even simple handling of mice resulted in transient elevations of corticosterone levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Tuli1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Rasmussen1">[56]</xref>, consistent with these activities as being stressful. On the other hand, changing cages helps avoid toxic in-cage accumulation of ammonia and carbon dioxide, as well as minimizing noxious odors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-ReebWhitaker1">[57]</xref>. Thus, guidelines governing the frequency of changing cages include consideration of hygiene, health of the animals, health of facility personnel and costs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047416-Jennings1">[58]</xref>. Fortunately for ongoing experimental protocols in many laboratories, our data did not discern a microbiota change upon simple cage change after mice were acclimated to their new facility, although the possibility of a subtle, but significant, change in colonizing microbes should not disregarded in all situations.</p>
      <p>Looking at the taxonomic data, the evidence indicates a significant decrease in <italic>Lactobacillales</italic> from the microbiota within the first 24 hours of a combined facility/cage change. Several other changes in the microbiota composition were also evident. After the initial shift in microbiota, there was a return to a composition that resembled baseline by day 5. This resilience supports that a rest period of approximately five days may be adequate for laboratory mice to acclimate following intracampus facility change. In addition, the results reported here suggest that the composition of the microbiota could be a useful non-invasive parameter to refine husbandry practices to minimize impact, optimizing both experimental protocols and evidence-based guidelines for animal care.</p>
