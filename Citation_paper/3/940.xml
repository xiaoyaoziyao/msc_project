        <p>Epidemiological investigations have shown that fetuses with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) are susceptible to adult metabolic syndrome. Clinical investigations and experiments have demonstrated that caffeine is a definite inducer of IUGR, as children who ingest caffeine-containing food or drinks are highly susceptible to adult obesity and hypertension. Our goals for this study were to investigate the effect of prenatal caffeine ingestion on the functional development of the fetal hippocampus and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and to clarify an intrauterine HPA axis-associated neuroendocrine alteration induced by caffeine. Pregnant Wistar rats were intragastrically administered 20, 60, and 180 mg/kg·d caffeine from gestational days 11–20. The results show that prenatal caffeine ingestion significantly decreased the expression of fetal hypothalamus corticotrophin-releasing hormone. The fetal adrenal cortex changed into slight and the expression of fetal adrenal steroid acute regulatory protein (StAR) and cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc), as well as the level of fetal adrenal endogenous corticosterone (CORT), were all significantly decreased after caffeine treatment. Moreover, caffeine ingestion significantly increased the levels of maternal and fetal blood CORT and decreased the expression of placental 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 (11β-HSD-2). Additionally, both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies show that caffeine can downregulate the expression of fetal hippocampal 11β-HSD-2, promote the expression of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 and glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and enhance DNA methylation within the hippocampal 11β-HSD-2 promoter. These results suggest that prenatal caffeine ingestion inhibits the development of the fetal HPA axis, which may be associated with the fetal overexposure to maternal glucocorticoid and activated glucocorticoid metabolism in the fetal hippocampus. These results will be beneficial in elucidating the developmental toxicity of caffeine and in exploring the fetal origin of adult HPA axis dysfunction and metabolic syndrome susceptibility for offspring with IUGR induced by caffeine.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) refers to the poor growth of a baby while in the mother's womb during pregnancy. Specifically, it is defined as a developing baby weighing 10% or two standard deviations less than the mean body weight of other babies at the same gestational age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Valsamakis1">[1]</xref>. IUGR is often considered a root cause of a series of perinatal diseases, including fetal distress, neonatal asphyxia and perinatal death. In addition, the adverse effects of IUGR can be prolonged into maturity and result in physical and mental stunting, as well as increased susceptibility to adult metabolic syndromes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Neitzke1">[2]</xref>. Epidemiological investigation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Silveira1">[3]</xref> has revealed that the incidence of adult metabolic syndrome in IUGR-affected infants is 2.53-fold higher than that of normal fetuses. As a high-risk group susceptible to adult metabolic syndrome, this baby group has already drawn considerable attention.</p>
      <p>The etiology of IUGR is largely attributed to an adverse exogenous environment during pregnancy. Caffeine is a xanthine alkaloid widely consumed in the form of coffee, tea, soft beverages, food and some analgesic drugs. For example, 52% of all persons in the US over 10 years of age consume coffee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Barone1">[4]</xref>, and the consumption of caffeinated beverages during pregnancy is quite common <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Christian1">[5]</xref>. Clinical investigations and experiments have demonstrated that caffeine ingestion during pregnancy results in reproductive and developmental toxicities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Momoi1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Thayer1">[7]</xref>. In our previous study, we demonstrated that caffeine ingestion before and during pregnancy increases the incidence of adsorption and stillbirth in mice, and the live fetal growth and developmental status as estimated from several indices (such as body weight and body length) is severely retarded <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Huang1">[8]</xref>. Reports also indicate that children who ingest caffeine-containing food or drinks are highly susceptible to metabolic syndromes such as obesity and hypertension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-James1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Cayetanot1">[10]</xref>. These results suggest that IUGR induced by prenatal caffeine ingestion may increase the susceptibility to adult metabolic syndrome. The underlying mechanism in reference to the fetal origin, however, has not been clarified.</p>
      <p>The well accepted hypothesis pertaining to the underlying mechanism of IUGR, as well as the high susceptibility to adult metabolic syndrome, is “intrauterine endocrine metabolic programming” proposed by Fowden <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Fowden1">[11]</xref>, which states that adverse intrauterine environment (i.e., stress, hypoxemia and malnutrition) changes the development of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, retarding fetal growth and increasing the sensitivity to metabolic hormones in peripheral tissues. After birth, these babies would present an increased HPA axis sensitivity, which would accelerate the process of metabolic disturbance. Recent reports also have emphasized that the altered programming of the HPA axis is most likely involved in the underlying mechanism behind the intrauterine origin of adult metabolic syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Xita1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-KanakaGantenbein1">[13]</xref>. Glucocorticoid (GC) is known to be an important factor in insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome in adults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Anagnostis1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Walke1">[15]</xref>. Circulatory GC has been reported to regulate a series of signaling pathways related to insulin resistance, including the insulin-like growth factor/insulin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Radosavljevi1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Chang1">[17]</xref>, adiponectin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-LpezBermejo1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Hotta1">[19]</xref> and leptin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Brabant1">[20]</xref> signaling pathways.</p>
      <p>Our recent study and research data from other laboratories have reported that caffeine elevates GC levels in both humans and animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Ping1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Pettenuzzo1">[24]</xref>. Our other studies have confirmed that prenatal nicotine and ethanol exposure increased the expression of adrenal steroid acute regulatory protein (StAR) and cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) in pregnant rats but decreased their expression in IUGR fetuses. Additionally, nicotine and ethanol reduced the expression of placental 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 (11β-HSD-2), which is responsible for the inactivation of maternal-derived glucocorticoid (GC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Chen1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Liang1">[26]</xref>. These observations suggest that prenatal nicotine and ethanol exposure resulted in fetal overexposure to maternal GC. However, whether prenatal caffeine ingestion could induce high levels of GC in the IUGR fetus to affect the development of the fetal HPA axis, or what the underlying mechanisms may be, is unknown.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we aimed to demonstrate that prenatal caffeine ingestion leads to fetal overexposure to maternal GC. An additional goal was to further observe the functional development of the fetal hippocampus and the HPA axis. This work will be beneficial in elucidating the developmental toxicity of caffeine and in exploring the fetal origin of adult HPA axis dysfunction and metabolic syndrome susceptibility for offspring with IUGR induced by caffeine.</p>

            <p>Pregnant rats ingested different doses of caffeine (20, 60, and 180 mg/kg) once per day from gestational day (GD) 11 to GD20. On GD20, the pregnant rats were anesthetized, and all of the fetuses in each group were weighed for calculation of the intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) rate. One whole fetal brain and one pair of fetal adrenal glands were randomly selected from each group and processed for hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. The fetal hypothalamus and adrenal glands were also dissected under an anatomy scope and collected. Fetal tissues from each single pregnant rat were counted as one sample.

        <p>The promoter methylation state of 15, 398 genes of the primary fetal rat hippocampal neuron after 24 h of treatment with 300 µM caffeine was examined using the RN34 RefSeq promoter methylation array provided by Roche NimbleGen Inc.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The HPA axis is an essential neuroendocrine axis that includes the hypothalamic CRH, pituitary ACTH, adrenal GC, and their corresponding receptors. The hypothalamus serves as a “transfer station” to receive signals from the superior regulation center and regulate the release of pituitary ACTH and adrenal GC. The adrenal, as the terminal effector organ of the HPA axis, secretes GC and plays a crucial role in individual growth and development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Fowden2">[27]</xref>. Cholesterol, as the substrate for GC synthesis, needs to be transferred from the outer mitochondrial membrane to the inner membrane, where P450scc cleaves the cholesterol side chain to produce pregnenolone, and StAR is the transport protein that regulates cholesterol transfer within the mitochondria. Accordingly, both StAR and P450scc are essential for GC synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Morrow1">[28]</xref>. The results of this study indicate that the expression of fetal hypothalamic CRH was remarkably reduced, the fetal adrenal cortex changed into slight and the expression of StAR and P450scc, as well as the level of fetal adrenal endogenous CORT, were all significantly decreased after caffeine treatment, suggesting that prenatal caffeine ingestion inhibits the functional development of the fetal HPA axis.</p>
      <p>In physiological conditions, the placental barrier builds and maintains a GC concentration gradient (approximately 10-fold) between the mother and the fetus during pregnancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-McNeil1">[29]</xref>. The placental 11β-HSD-2 is a GC-inactivated enzyme responsible for preventing the fetus from being overexposed to the maternal GC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Burton1">[30]</xref>. Hence, placental 11β-HSD-2 is a crucial factor in determining the fetal GC level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Barbazanges1">[31]</xref>. In the present study, we found that the level of blood CORT in the mother was increased after caffeine treatment, which was consistent with our recent report that caffeine increased cortisol production in human adrenocortical cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Ping1">[21]</xref>. Meanwhile, we found that the expression of placental 11β-HSD-2 was reduced, and the level of CORT in fetal blood was increased after caffeine treatment. Thus, we proposed that prenatal caffeine ingestion-induced high levels of GC in the fetus mainly come from the mother rats and that this high level of GC could inhibit the activity of the fetal HPA axis through a negative feedback regulation. Our recent report also demonstrated that prenatal dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocorticoid) treatment led to obvious HPA axis suppression in IUGR fetal rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Xu1">[32]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The hippocampus, as the important high negative feedback regulatory center of the HPA axis, is the most sensitive and vulnerable neural target site for circulatory GC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-deQuervain1">[33]</xref>. <italic>In utero</italic>, fetal hippocampal GC regulates the functional development of the HPA axis by a negative feedback loop, which is mediated via predominantly expressed GR during the time of fetal development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Meaney1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Weaver1">[35]</xref>. The GR expression-dependent regulation of the HPA axis in the fetal hippocampus is gradually established with the progression of pregnancy and maturation of the central nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Reichardt1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Owen1">[37]</xref>. Studies by Weaver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Weaver2">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Weaver3">[39]</xref> further suggest a causal relationship between GR expression and the response of the HPA axis in rat offspring during the perinatal period. All of these results indicate a causative link between fetal hippocampal GC/GR and the development of the fetal HPA axis. Hippocampal 11β-HSD is involved in regulating the binding of GC to GR. 11β-HSD can be subdivided into types 1 and 2 that catalyze interconversion of active glucocorticoids (cortisol in humans and corticosterone in rodents) and the inactive 11-keto form (cortisone in humans and 11-dehydrocorticosterone in rodents), thereby modulating the concentration and function of hippocampal GC. 11β-HSD-2 is widely expressed in fetal brain during the mid-embryonic development period, while 11β-HSD-1 and GR are limitedly expressed in fetal brain at mid-embryonic development, reaching their peaks in the late embryonic development period and remaining until after birth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Diaz1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Thompson1">[42]</xref>. Research has demonstrated that 11β-HSD-1 and GR are colocalized in the same hippocampal neuron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Wan1">[43]</xref>. GC was implicated in the upregulation of 11β-HSD-1 activity via a positive feedback loop regulation of GR, and enhanced 11β-HSD-1 activity may further enhance the local active GC levels in the hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-McNeil1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Seckl1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Yang1">[45]</xref>. In this study, 11β-HSD-1 and GR expression increased in the fetal hippocampus after prenatal caffeine ingestion, suggesting that fetal overexposure to maternal GC induced by caffeine could inhibit the activity of the fetal HPA axis via enhanced hippocampal 11β-HSD-1 and GR through a negative feedback regulation.</p>
      <p>Low molecular weight lipophilic caffeine readily crosses the placental barrier and reaches the fetus, where it is mainly distributed in the brain and liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Kuczkowski1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Wilkinson1">[47]</xref>. In addition, caffeine is difficult to metabolize and excrete because of its prolonged circulation half-life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Kuczkowski1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Cohen1">[48]</xref>, resulting in a high accumulation in the fetus. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we have detected the existence of caffeine in fetal blood after prenatal caffeine ingestion. In the current study, we further demonstrated that caffeine not only inhibited the 11β-HSD-2 expression but also intensified the expression of 11β-HSD-1 and GR in the primary fetal hippocampal neuron <italic>in vitro</italic>, and such effects showed a favorable dose- and time-dependent manner. Therefore, caffeine was proven to have a direct action on 11β-HSD and GR expression in the fetal hippocampus, which is consistent with the <italic>in vivo</italic> results. The reduced expression of 11β-HSD-2 by caffeine may increase the levels of active GC, as well as the expression of 11β-HSD-1 and GR in the fetal hippocampus, which in turn further inhibit the function and development of the fetal HPA axis.</p>
      <p>Epigenetic dysregulation is an important molecular mechanism through which a prenatal insult such as xenobiotic exposure can persistently affect the postnatal phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Dolinoy1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Jirtle1">[50]</xref>. Mechanisms such as DNA CpG methylation affect gene expression by regulating the transcriptional machinery and transcriptional factor access to DNA. The 11β-HSD-2 promoter contains highly GC-rich regions (80% of the sequence) that have been shown to be epigenetically regulated, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-AlikhaniKoopaei1">[51]</xref>. Therefore, in the present study, we propose that epigenetic regulation is a good candidate mechanism for hippocampal 11β-HSD-2 expression. For rat 11β-HSD-2, the promoter region next to the transcriptional start site is rich in binding sites for transcriptional enhancers, namely, the specificity protein 1 (Sp1) and NF-kappa B (NF-κB) p65. Basega <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Baserga1">[52]</xref> recently reported that in a rat IUGR model induced by a bilateral uterine artery ligation during the embryonic period, a persistent decrease occurred in kidney 11β-HSD-2 mRNA and protein expression. These authors suggested that the modified methylation pattern in the CpG sites of the 11β-HSD-2 promoter, as well as the changes in the corresponding transcriptional factor binding, possibly leads to reduced 11β-HSD-2 expression. In the present study, we demonstrated that caffeine enhanced the methylation ratio of multiple single CpG sites, as well as the total methylation ratio at nt −358 to −77 of the hippocampal 11β-HSD-2 promoter. Furthermore, the methylated sites at nt −214 and −152 act as binding sites for Sp1 and NF-κBp65 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Baserga1">[52]</xref>, indicating that caffeine may inhibit the binding of Sp1 and NFκB p65 to the promoter via methylation of these binding sites, resulting in the inhibition of 11β-HSD-2 expression.</p>

      <p>In summary, our present findings suggest that prenatal caffeine ingestion induces an intrauterine HPA axis-related neuroendocrine alteration in the IUGR rat model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044497-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). In brief, prenatal caffeine ingestion can elevate the maternal GC level and inhibit the placental 11β-HSD-2 expression, thereby causing a fetal overexposure to maternal GC. Moreover, caffeine can enter the fetus and directly inhibit the fetal hippocampal 11β-HSD-2 expression by epigenetic dysregulation. These changes subsequently enhanced the expression of 11β-HSD-1 and GR in the fetal hippocampus, which inhibit the fetal HPA axis and retard the fetal development. Additional results from our group further revealed that using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabonomics technology, we observed that prenatal caffeine ingestion could characteristically change the fetal metabonome, which is most likely attributed to the alterations in glucose and lipid metabolic pathways induced by increased circulatory GC level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Liu1">[53]</xref>. In addition, in our recent parallel experiment, caffeine-induced alterations in the fetal HPA axis and in glucose and lipid metabolism could be maintained until the postnatal period and were found to enhance the susceptibility to adult metabolic syndrome and fatty liver (unpublished data). Therefore, these results will be beneficial in elucidating the fetal origin of adult HPA axis dysfunction and metabolic syndrome susceptibility for offspring with IUGR induced by caffeine.</p>

Using the dose conversion between humans and rats (human:rats1∶6.17) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-ReaganShaw1">[55]</xref>, the lowest dose of caffeine ingestion (20 mg/kg·d) by pregnant rats in the present study is 1.5-fold higher than the reported data, which is equivalent to 1.5–2.2 cups of daily coffee intake by pregnant women (according to a previous investigation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Butt1">[56]</xref>, a standard cup of coffee contains 100–150 mg of caffeine on average). Although the fetal body weight is approximately 90% that of the control, a series of important indices reflecting fetal growth and development (such as StAR and P450scc in fetal adrenal glands) were significantly decreased to 10%–13% of those in the control under a lower caffeine treatment dose, suggesting that daily caffeine ingestion during pregnancy can inhibit the fetal HPA axis development. Therefore, caffeine ingestion during pregnancy should be avoided.</p>

All of the fetal rats in each group were taken into account to calculate the IUGR rate, according to previously reported criteria for IUGR evaluation (IUGR was diagnosed when the body weight of each individual animal from the treated group was two standard deviations less than the mean body weight of the control group) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Valsamakis1">[1]</xref>. One whole fetal brain and one pair of fetal adrenal glands were randomly selected from the control and the caffeine groups (180 mg/kg·d) for fixing in a 10% formaldehyde solution, embedding in paraffin and processing for light microscopy. Meanwhile, a series of fetal tissues, including hippocampus, hypothalamus and adrenal glands, was dissected under an anatomy scope and collected. The maternal and fetal serum prepared from blood samples, as well as the placenta, were also collected. All samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at −80°C for the subsequent experiments.</p>

        <title>Primary Culture of the Hippocampal Neuron Isolated from Fetal Rats</title>
        <p>The pregnant rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and sacrificed on GD20, and the fetuses were rapidly removed. Fetal brains were collected and placed on ice. The hippocampuses from the collected fetal brains were dissected and isolated under an anatomy scope in an ice-cold buffer consisting of 136 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.2 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 16.7 mM glucose, 20.8 mM saccharose, 0.0012% phenol red, and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4). The isolated hippocampuses were mechanically triturated and then digested in a solution containing 0.25% trypsin and 1 mM EDTA at 37°C for 10 min. A single cell suspension was obtained by repeated passages of the dissociated tissues through a flame-polished pipette in a plating medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS). The cells were finally plated on poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine-coated dishes (0.1 mg/ml) at optimal cell densities. The cultures were kept at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub>-containing atmosphere. The day of dissection was assigned as day 0 (D0). On D1, the serum-containing plating medium was replaced with a growth medium (serum-free neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27 supplement and 0.4% glutamine). On D4, D7, and D10, half of the growth medium was changed. On D10, the cells were treated with 300 µM caffeine for 0–72 h or with several different concentrations of caffeine (0, 0.3, 3, 30, and 300 µM) for 24 h. After treatment, the cells were collected for further analysis. The caffeine concentrations (0.3–300 µM) in the present <italic>in vivo</italic> study were designed according to a previous report that 105–310 µM caffeine corresponds to concentrations transferred by the placenta of heavy caffeine consumers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044497-Marret1">[57]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR and Western Blotting</title>
        <p>Total RNA and protein were isolated from the fetal tissues (hippocampus, hypothalamus, and adrenal glands), placentas, and cultured hippocampal neurons using the Trizol reagent, following the manufacturer’s protocol. The same tissues of each littermate were pooled for homogenization. After DNAse I (RNase-free) treatment, the concentration and purity of the isolated RNA were determined using a spectrophotometer and adjusted to 1 µg/µl. Total RNA was stored in diethyl pyrocarbonate-H<sub>2</sub>O (DEPC-H<sub>2</sub>O) at −80°C. The protein concentration was measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit.</p>
        <p>For real-time quantitative (RT-PCR) analysis, single-strand cDNA was prepared from 2 µg of total RNA according to the protocol of the Exscript RT reagent kit. Primers were designed using Primer Premier 5.0, and their sequences are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0044497-t001">Table 1</xref>. Relative standard curves were constructed for the following target rat genes: GR, CRH, StAR, P450scc, 11β-HSD-1, and 11β-HSD-2, as well as the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), using the corresponding RT-PCR products isolated by DNA extraction kit with different concentrations ranging from 10<sup>−3</sup>–10<sup>−9 </sup>pg per reaction. PCR assays were performed in 36-well optical reaction plates using the RG-3000 Rotor-Gene 4 Channel Multiplexing System (Corbett Research Pty Ltd., Sydney, Australia) at a total volume of 25 µl reaction mixture containing 2 µl of 0.1 µg/µl cDNA template, 0.5 µl of 10 µmol/l of each primer, 12.5 µl of 2× Premix Ex Taq, 0.5 µl of 20× SYBR Green I, and 9 µl of DEPC-H<sub>2</sub>O. To quantify the transcripts of the genes precisely, the expression of GAPDH mRNA was used as the quantitative control, and each sample was normalized on the basis of GAPDH mRNA content. The PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 95°C, 10 s for pre-denaturation; 95°C, 5 s for denaturation; appropriate annealing conditions for each gene (listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0044497-t001">Table 1</xref>); 72°C, 15 s for elongation (this step only for the GAPDH reaction).

        <p>For the Western blotting analysis, 50 µg of protein per well was loaded on a 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide electrophoresis (SDS/PAGE) gel and resolved via standard electrophoresis. The gels were then electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature and then probed overnight at 4°C using polyclonal antibodies against 11β-HSD-2, 11β-HSD-1, GR, and CRH at a final dilution of 1∶400 (w/v). Protein molecular weight markers were included on each blot. To verify the loading of same amount of samples, the membranes were probed overnight at 4°C using polyclonal GAPDH antibodies at a final dilution of 1∶600 (w/v). The membranes were extensively washed in PBS with Tween-20 and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1∶3000 w/v).

        <p>An RN34 RefSeq promoter methylation array (No. C4226-00-01, Roche NimbleGen Inc., Madison, WI, USA) was used to detect the changes in the promoter methylation state of 15,398 genes in the cultured hippocampus neuron after 300 µM caffeine treatment for 24 h. The extraction of sample genomic DNA, DNA quantification, immunoprecipitation and hybridization of the methylated DNA, chemiluminescence detection, image acquisition, and data analysis were all conducted by Kang Cheng Biotechnology Co., Ltd.
