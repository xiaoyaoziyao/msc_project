<abstract>
<p>We herein demonstrate the immune-regulatory effect of embryonic stem cell-derived dendritic cells (ES-DCs) using two models of autoimmune disease, namely non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Treatment of pre-diabetic NOD mice with ES-DCs exerted almost complete suppression of diabetes development during the observation period for more than 40 weeks. The prevention of diabetes by ES-DCs was accompanied with significant reduction of insulitis and decreased number of Th1 and Th17 cells in the spleen. Development of EAE was also inhibited by the treatment with ES-DCs, and the therapeutic effect was obtained even if ES-DCs were administrated after the onset of clinical symptoms. Treatment of EAE-induced mice with ES-DCs reduced the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the spinal cord and suppressed the T cell response to the myelin antigen. Importantly, the ES-DC treatment did not affect T cell response to an exogenous antigen. As the mechanisms underlying the reduction of the number of infiltrating Th1 cells, we observed the inhibition of differentiation and proliferation of Th1 cells by ES-DCs. Furthermore, the expression of VLA-4Î± on Th1 cells was significantly inhibited by ES-DCs. Considering the recent advances in human induced pluripotent stem cell-related technologies, these results suggest a clinical application for pluripotent stem cell-derived dendritic cells as a therapy for T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Autoimmune diseases occur and develop when immunological self-tolerance is broken by some mechanisms and autoreactive lymphocytes attack tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Rioux1">[1]</xref>. Although therapeutic drugs including corticosteroids, other immune suppressants, and molecularly targeted drugs are effectively used for the treatment of some autoimmune diseases, long-term administration of these drugs increases the risk of systemic immune suppression and consequent opportunistic infections or the development of cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Lionakis1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Tan1">[3]</xref>. Therefore, it would be greatly advantageous if we could develop a therapeutic means of inhibiting autoimmunity while preserving immunity against exogenous pathogens.</p>
<p>Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells with the ability to stimulate naÃ¯ve T cells and initiate primary immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Liu1">[4]</xref>. They are also involved in the maintenance of peripheral self-tolerance by promoting the function of regulatory T cells (Treg) or by inhibiting activation of auto-reactive T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Comabella1">[5]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Steinman1">[8]</xref>. Moreover, a DC subset was reported to contribute to the polarizing influences on T helper differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Rissoan1">[9]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Pulendran1">[11]</xref>. The DC function can be altered by some immune suppressive drugs, and this mechanism has been shown to play a role in the control of autoimmune diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Idzko1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Schwab1">[13]</xref>. For these reasons, therapies utilizing DCs have previously been attempted for autoimmune diseases. Indeed some animal models of autoimmune diseases were prevented by the transfer of modulated DCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Menges1">[14]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Verginis1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our laboratory previously investigated the treatment of autoimmune diseases by DCs. We have established methods to generate DCs <italic>in vitro</italic> from embryonic stem (ES) and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, which are characterized by pluripotency and an infinite propagation capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Senju1">[19]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Senju3">[21]</xref>. Moreover, we also established a strategy for the genetic modification of ES or iPS cell-derived DCs (ES-or iPS-DCs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Senju1">[19]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Hirata1">[22]</xref> in which a gene expression vector is introduced into ES or iPS cells that are then induced to differentiate into ES- or iPS-DCs. This enabled us to demonstrate that genetically modified ES- or iPS-DCs exert preventive or therapeutic effects against mouse models of autoimmunity or cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Senju2">[20]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Matsuyoshi1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>We previously carried out the intraperitoneal (i.p.) transfer of genetically modified ES-DCs to protect against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The ES-DCs presented MOG peptide in the context of MHC class II molecules and expressed an immunoregulatory molecule, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) or Programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Hirata1">[22]</xref>. Although this treatment is considered a promising means to regulate responses in an antigen-specific manner, multiple auto-antigens are involved in the pathogenesis of most human autoimmune disorders. Thus, it should be proved that the treatment is effective not only against single antigen-induced autoimmunity, but also spontaneously occurring autoimmunity involving multiple auto-antigens.</p>
<p>In the present study, therefore, we examined the protective effect of non-genetically modified and genetically modified ES-DCs against diabetes in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, which is a spontaneously occurring autoimmune disease involving multiple auto-antigens. Both ES-DC subsets prevented the onset of diabetes. Furthermore, the intravenous injection of ES-DCs exhibited a therapeutic effect against MOG-induced EAE. ES-DCs suppressed the differentiation and proliferation of Th1 cells both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. These results suggest that therapy with pluripotent stem cell-derived DCs is a novel and rational approach for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.</p>

<title>Inhibition of diabetes in NOD mice by ES-DCs with or without transgene-derived immunoregulatory molecules</title>
<p>We previously demonstrated that MOG-induced EAE was prevented by the i.p. transfer of genetically modified ES-DCs, which presented MOG peptides in the context of MHC class II molecules and expressed the immunoregulatory molecule TRAIL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Hirata1">[22]</xref>. However, as various auto-antigens are etiologically involved in human autoimmunity, we investigated the preventive effects of genetically modified ES-DCs in another autoimmune model: NOD mice. NOD mice are widely used as an animal model for type 1 diabetes, and spontaneously develop diabetes as a result of the destruction of pancreatic Î² cells by auto-reactive T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Atkinson1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Delovitch1">[31]</xref>.

We chose insulin B chain (peptides B9â23) and GAD65 (peptides 493â586) as auto-antigens for transfecting ES cells. It was previously reported that most CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells infiltrating islets recognize insulin B chain 9â23 peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Daniel2">[38]</xref>, while, in the case of GAD65, two peptides (509â528 and 524â543) were shown to trigger the earliest response in NOD mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Kaufman1">[37]</xref>. Therefore, GAD65 peptide was configured to include these epitopes prior to ES cell transfection.</p>
<p>For the efficient presentation of insulin or GAD65 peptide in the context of MHC class II molecules, we used a previously devised expression vector in which cDNA for the human MHC class II-associated Ii chain was mutated to contain the objective antigenic peptide in the class II-associated Ii peptide (CLIP) region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Fujii1">[39]</xref>.

Using this method, we generated the gene expression vectors pCAG-Insulin-IPuro and pCAG-GAD65-IPuro (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115198.s002">S2A Figure</xref>). In pCAG-Insulin-IPuro, cDNA for the human Ii chain was mutated to contain an oligo DNA encoding the B9â23 epitope in the CLIP region. In pCAG-GAD65-IPuro, an HA tag was inserted at the C terminus of GAD65 peptide 493â586 and fused with the human Ii chain. The pCAG-TRAIL-INeo vector was generated previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Hirata1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>Resultant single- or double-transfectant NOD ES cell clones were produced and differentiated into ES-DCs, and the expression of transfected genes was confirmed by flow-cytometric analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115198.s002">S2BâC Figure</xref>). ES-DC cell lines expressing TRAIL were identified using TRAIL-sensitive L929 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115198.s002">S2D Figure</xref>). We established three types of transfected ES-DCs: those expressing insulin peptide plus TRAIL (ES-DC-TRAIL/insulin), those expressing GAD65 peptide plus TRAIL (ES-DC-TRAIL/GAD65), and those expressing TRAIL only (ES-DC-TRAIL).</p>

In addition, non-genetically-modified ES-DCs also exhibited an equivalent disease prevention effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115198-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), suggesting that ES-DCs intrinsically possess a capacity to suppress autoimmune-mediated diabetes.</p>

<p>We determined to investigate the disease-preventive effect of non-genetically modified ES-DCs more precisely. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115198-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, the repeated administration of ES-DCs, but not a single dose, suppressed diabetes. Injection of undifferentiated NOD-ES cells never exerted disease-preventive effect irrespective of the number of times of injections. We thus ruled out the possibility that disease-preventive effect was mediated by undifferentiated ES cells contaminated in the ES-DC preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115198-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).

<title>Therapeutic effect of ES-DCs against diabetic NOD/SCID mice</title>
<p>The above work revealed a disease-preventive effect of ES-DCs without forced expression of immunosuppressive molecules in multiple auto-antigen-related and naturally occurring autoimmunity in NOD mice. This therapy may prevent the recurrence of autoimmune disease. However, in clinical medicine, it is not practical to administrate ES-DCs prophylactically before the initial onset of autoimmune diseases. Therefore, we validated the effect of ES-DCs in a therapeutic but not prophylactic setting. Some studies reported that therapeutic administration of anti-CD3, anti-IL-17, anti-IL-25 antibodies and proinsulin DNA improved hyperglycemia in diabetic NOD mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Chatenoud1">[43]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Ablamunits1">[47]</xref>.</p>
<p>To investigate therapeutic function of ES-DCs, splenocytes derived from diabetic NOD mice were i.v. injected into NOD/SCID mice. After the next day of the development of diabetes, diabetic NOD/SCID mice were treated with total three times i.p. injections of ES-DCs or PBS in every 3 days. In the result, although ES-DCs did not improve hyperglycemia in NOD/SCID mice (data not shown), ES-DC-treated NOD/SCID mice lived significantly longer than PBS-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115198-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). These results suggest the possibility that ES-DCs inhibited the further destruction of the islets, preserved the residual insulin-secreting function, and have a therapeutic effect.</p>

To test this possibility, we analyzed the number and frequency of infiltrating cells into the spinal cord on days 15, 19, and 22 in EAE-induced mice. The absolute numbers of infiltrating cells in ES-DC-treated mice were significantly decreased on days 15, 19, and 22 compared with control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115198-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>).

<p>(A) 7.0Ã10<sup>5</sup> naÃ¯ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD4<sup>+</sup> CD62L<sup>+</sup>) were purified from spleen of B6 mice and cultured for 3 days under Th1, Th17 and iTreg cell differentiation conditions as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2"><italic>Material and Methods</italic></xref>, in the presence or absence of cultured supernatant of ES-DCs. After culture, cells were stimulated with PMA/ionomycin, and analyzed for IL-17A and IFN-Î³ by intracellular staining. T cells cultured in iTreg-conditions were analyzed for FoxP3 by intracellular staining. (B) Differentiated OT-II Th1, Th17, and iTreg cells (2.5Ã10<sup>4</sup>) were cultured with irradiated BM-DCs (1.0Ã10<sup>4</sup>), OT-II peptide (2.5 ÂµM) and increasing dosage of ES-DCs for 72 h. The proliferative response was quantified by measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine incorporation in the final 12 h of the culture. (C) Mice were injected i.p. with 1 mg BrdU for consecutive 5 days from the starting date of the therapy with ES-DCs (2Ã10<sup>6</sup>) or PBS. BrdU incorporation into IFN-Î³<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Th1 cells) in the spinal cord of each mouse was assessed <italic>ex vivo</italic> after 5 days. Dot plots (<italic>left</italic>) and bar graphs (<italic>right</italic>) represent the frequencies of BrdU<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells within the total CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and BrdU<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells in Th1 cells, respectively (<italic>n</italic>â=â5â6 per group).

<p>To explore this possibility <italic>in vivo</italic>, ES-DCs or PBS-injected mice were treated with BrdU for 5 days from day 10 after immunization, and BrdU incorporation into Th1 cells infiltrating into the spinal cord was measured by flow cytometry. We found that ES-DCs also impeded the proliferation of Th1 cells <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115198-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>), confirming that they inhibited the differentiation and proliferation of Th1 cells.</p>

<title>Immigration of ES-DCs into the spinal cord in EAE-induced mice</title>
<p>Next, we investigated the distribution of <italic>in vivo</italic> administered ES-DCs. As ES-DCs are CD45.2 single-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115198-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>), once transferred into CD45.1<sup>+</sup> mice they can readily be distinguished from intrinsic mouse cells. We i.v. injected ES-DCs into EAE-induced CD45.1<sup>+</sup> mice, and 10 days later investigated the immigration of ES-DCs into spinal cord. In the results, ES-DCs were present in the spinal cord under EAE-induced conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115198-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). These results suggest that ES-DCs immigrate into the inflamed organ and exert suppressive activity on Th1 cells.</p>

<title>ES-DCs regulate the expression of VLA-4Î± in lungs Th1 cells</title>
<p>Recently, it has been reported that the lungs are key for auto-reactive T cells to induce the expression of some chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules to enable entry into target organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Odoardi1">[48]</xref>. As ES-DCs were localized in the lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115198-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>), we considered the possibility that ES-DCs affect the expression of homing molecules on auto-reactive T cells in the lung, and focused on integrin Î±4Î²1 (very late antigen-4, VLA-4Î±). VLA-4Î± controls the migration of lymphocytes into affected organs by binding with the adhesion molecule VCAM-1, which is expressed on endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Yednock1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Burkly1">[50]</xref>. Five days after the injection of ES-DCs, the frequency of VLA-4Î±<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in ES-DC-treated mice was lower than in untreated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115198-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>). Moreover, the proportion of VLA-4Î±<sup>â</sup> Th1 cells was elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115198-g008">Fig. 8C</xref>), and the proportion of VLA-4Î±<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells to total Th1 cells was decreased in ES-DC-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115198-g008">Fig. 8D</xref>). Finally, we found that the presence of ES-DCs reduced VLA-4Î± expression in Th1 cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115198-g008">Fig. 8E</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that ES-DCs limit the migration of Th1 cells via the regulation of VLA-4Î±, and reduce tissue damage in some autoimmune diseases.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We previously showed that genetically modified ES-DCs inhibit the onset of the EAE, a model of autoimmune disease induced by immunization with a specific myelin auto-antigen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Hirata1">[22]</xref>. We now demonstrate that both genetically modified and non-modified ES-DCs prevented the onset of diabetes in NOD mice, a spontaneously occurring autoimmune disease caused by immunity against multiple islet antigens, as well as EAE.</p>
<p>Some studies reported that modulated BM-DCs or lymph node (LN)-derived DCs were intravenously or intraperitoneally administrated to NOD mice, and the injections via both routes were effective <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-FeiliHariri1">[15]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-ClareSalzler1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Cheatem1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Machen1">[52]</xref>. We previously found that i.p. transferred ES-DCs accumulated in the spleen and mesenteric LNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Matsuyoshi1">[23]</xref>, and a previous study reported the proliferation of splenocytes in response to islet-associated auto-antigens in 4-week old prediabetic female NOD mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Quinn2">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Tisch1">[53]</xref>. Therefore, although we examined the effect of i.p. injection of ES-DCs in the current study, i.v. therapy with ES-DCs may also exert the preventive effect.</p>
<p>In the current study, the disease-preventive effect of ES-DCs was accompanied with the reduction of numbers and frequencies of Th1 and Th17 cells in the spleen, but no effect on number of Treg cells was observed. The pathogenesis of diabetes in NOD mice is strongly linked to Th1 cells, and thus the treatment with ES-DCs may have effectively protected against islet Î²-cell destruction through the direct inhibition of pathogenic T cells.</p>
<p>However, even NOD mice injected five times with ES-DCs developed diabetes at around 2 years of age (data not shown), indicating that while ES-DCs induce long-term protection from diabetes, they do not completely extinguish auto-reactive T cells. Therefore, periodic and multiple administrations of ES-DCs are required for long-term protection from disease. Future clinical applications of DC treatment may require administration protocols to achieve lasting remission in human autoimmune diseases.</p>
<p>EAE is used as a mouse model of the human disease multiple sclerosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-McFarland1">[54]</xref>. The pathogenesis of EAE involves the activation and invasion of myelin antigen-specific Th1 or Th17 cells into the central nervous system (CNS), leading to the expansion of resident microglia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Komiyama1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Gutcher1">[56]</xref>. In typical EAE, Th1 cells mainly penetrate the parenchyma of the spinal cord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Archambault1">[57]</xref>. However, it has been reported that IFN-Î³-deficient T cells induce atypical EAE in which cells infiltrate the cerebrum and brain stem but not the spinal cord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Lees1">[58]</xref>. Moreover, a higher ratio of Th17/Th1 cells has recently been found to be important for T cells to invade the cerebrum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Stromnes1">[59]</xref>. These results indicate that the initial EAE pathogenesis differs between the spinal cord and the brain in terms of types of auto-reactive T cells playing a major role.</p>
<p>We found that ES-DCs mainly regulated the differentiation and proliferation of Th1 cells, and that their capacity to regulate Th17 cells was less potent. Therefore, treatment with ES-DCs was more effective in decreasing infiltrating cells, especially Th1 cells into the spinal cord in typical EAE. In addition, difficulties in regulating Th17 cells may explain why clinical symptoms of EAE worsened slightly after ES-DC-treatment. The injection of ES-DCs also resulted in a decrease of CD11b<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells in the spinal cord in the late phase of EAE. As blood-derived myeloid cells, including monocytes, are key for EAE progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Ajami1">[60]</xref>, it is conceivable that the decrease in CD11b<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells may also contributed to the development of clinical symptom.</p>
<p>Next, we discuss where i.v. administrated ES-DCs performed their therapeutic function. We chose i.v. but not i.p. injection to administrate ES-DCs for the inhibition of EAE. We previously observed that i.p. injection of non-genetically modified ES-DCs were not effective in prevention of EAE, although we used an ES cell line different from currently used one <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Hirata1">[22]</xref>. As above described, i.p. injected ES-DCs were mainly localized in the spleen and mesenteric LNs. In the experimental schedule of the present study, we planned to administer ES-DCs at day 10 after EAE-induction when the inflammation in the CNS would have already started. Therefore, we considered that i.v. rather than i.p. administration of ES-DCs would be more effective to achieve therapeutic effect, because i.v. injection of ES-DCs were expected to result in more efficient migration into the spinal cord and encounter with pathogenic T cells as compared with the case of i.p. injection. Actually, we detected a certain fraction of i.v. transferred ES-DCs in the spinal cord, and the proliferation of spinal cord-infiltrating Th1 cells was decreased by the administration of ES-DCs. These results suggest that ES-DCs contributes, at least in part, to the suppression of Th1 cell response in the CNS. Further investigations are required to identify the key molecules that enable ES-DCs to migrate into the affected organ.</p>
<p>A certain fraction of injected ES-DCs was detected also in the lungs. Distribution of ES-DCs to lungs was significantly decreased under inflammatory condition in comparison to that under steady-state condition, and the absolute number of lung-localized ES-DC under inflammatory conditions were also slightly lower (data not shown). These results may be attributed to compositive causes; decreased percentage due to dilution resulting from the infiltration of other immune cells including pathogenic T cells in the lungs, and absolute decrease resulting from the migration of ES-DCs into the affected organ.</p>
<p>Although the detection of ES-DCs in the lung is a natural transition as venous blood flow to the heart drains into the lungs through the pulmonary artery, the lung is also of great importance in autoimmunity. Pathogenic T cells travel from lymphoid tissues through the bloodstream to the lung where they acquire homing molecules to migrate to the target organ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Odoardi1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Steinman2">[61]</xref>. Based on our findings that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the spinal cord were decreased in ES-DC-treated mice, we considered the possibility that ES-DCs down-modulate the expression of homing molecules on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the lung. We also observed a lower expression of VLA-4Î± on Th1 cells in ES-DC-treated mice. VLA-4Î± is a representative molecule for lymphocyte homing to the CNS. Indeed, the anti-VLA-4Î± antibody natalizumab was previously shown to impede the interaction of pathogenic T cells with VCAM-1 on endothelial cells, and to prevent the development of EAE and diabetes in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Odoardi1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Yang1">[62]</xref>. It is also effective in humans against multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Miller1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Ghosh1">[64]</xref>. Therefore, the down-modulation of VLA-4Î± on Th1 cells by ES-DCs in the present study may have contributed to the suppression of the autoimmune disease. However, the key mediator of ES-DCs that inhibited VLA-4Î± on Th1 cells was not obvious, and further investigations are required.</p>
<p>Intrinsic immune regulatory function of ES-DCs seems to be limited to inhibition of Th1 response. Additional immune regulatory functions such as the inhibition of Th17 response or the promotion of Treg cells would enhance the capacity of ES-DCs to control autoimmunity. To this end, we have established a strategy for the genetic modification of ES-/iPS-DCs and macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Senju1">[19]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Hirata1">[22]</xref>. Moreover, we previously reported that genetically modified ES-DCs expressing TRAIL induced the proliferation of Treg cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115198-Hirata2">[65]</xref>. In the current study, we utilized genetically modified ES-DCs for the treatment of NOD mice. Future work will require the generation of ES-/iPS-DCs with greater immunoregulatory effects, and a means for selecting effective immunoregulatory molecules. However, if treatment with ES-DCs causes systemic immune suppression, it is same as existing immune suppressive drugs and ES-DCs will have no value in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Herein, the T-cell dependent immune response to a foreign antigen were maintained, and ES-DCs may offer advantages against existing immune suppressive drugs.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we demonstrated the intrinsic function of ES-DCs to restore and maintain immune tolerance, leading to the prevention or improvement of autoimmune disease. Considering the recent advances in human iPS cell-related technologies, pluripotent stem cell-derived dendritic cells may be a promising means for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.</p>
