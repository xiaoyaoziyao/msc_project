          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is challenging to diagnose because of the non-specificity of symptoms; an unequivocal diagnosis can only be made using colonoscopy, which clinicians are reluctant to recommend for children. Diagnosis of pediatric IBD is therefore frequently delayed, leading to inappropriate treatment plans and poor outcomes. We investigated the use of 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples and new analytical methods to assess differences in the microbiota of children with IBD and other gastrointestinal disorders.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>We applied synthetic learning in microbial ecology (SLiME) analysis to 16S sequencing data obtained from i) published surveys of microbiota diversity in IBD and ii) fecal samples from 91 children and young adults who were treated in the gastroenterology program of Childrenâ€™s Hospital (Boston, USA). The developed method accurately distinguished control samples from those of patients with IBD; the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) value was 0.83 (corresponding to 80.3% sensitivity and 69.7% specificity at a set threshold). The accuracy was maintained among data sets collected by different sampling and sequencing methods. The method identified taxa associated with disease states and distinguished patients with Crohnâ€™s disease from those with ulcerative colitis with reasonable accuracy. The findings were validated using samples from an additional group of 68 patients; the validation test identified patients with IBD with an AUC value of 0.84 (e.g. 92% sensitivity, 58.5% specificity).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
          <p>Microbiome-based diagnostics can distinguish pediatric patients with IBD from patients with similar symptoms. Although this test can not replace endoscopy and histological examination as diagnostic tools, classification based on microbial diversity is an effective complementary technique for IBD detection in pediatric patients.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Crohnâ€™s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), collectively termed inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), are incurable conditions that cause ulceration of the intestinal mucosa. If left untreated, IBD may require repeated surgical intervention to remove affected parts of the gastrointestinal system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Carter1">[1]</xref> leading to malabsorption and nutritional complications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Kappelman1">[2]</xref>. Despite its importance, timely diagnosis is difficult because patients often present with non-specific symptoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Yantiss1">[3]</xref>, and the presence of CD or UC can only be confirmed by colonoscopy.</p>
      <p>Diagnosis is particularly challenging in children, for whom presenting symptoms may vary widely and may only consist of subtle extra-intestinal manifestations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Heikenen1">[4]</xref>. This in turn leads to a typical delay in the diagnosis of pediatric IBD, ranging from 4 weeks in severe colitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Spray1">[5]</xref> to 6â€“7 months in milder disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Heikenen1">[4]</xref>. Reducing this diagnostic delay is important, since a long period of unmanaged symptoms can significantly impact growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Spray1">[5]</xref> and early treatment is essential to preserving long-term quality of life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Devroede1">[6]</xref>. Thus a sensitive yet non-invasive detection tool, that could identify patients at high risk for IBD, and therefore warranting endoscopic evaluation, would be a valuable diagnostic aid.</p>
      <p>Non-invasive tests for IBD already exist, including antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Peeters1">[7]</xref>, imaging-based screens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Andersen1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Lffler1">[9]</xref>, and fecal biomarkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Lewis1">[10]</xref>. Specificities for existing methods range from 89% to 95% for either CD or UC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Ruemmele1">[11]</xref>, however,these methods are either limited to active disease, poorly sensitive (âˆ¼55%), or their outcome can be confounded by diseases other than IBD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Ruemmele1">[11]</xref>, limiting their clinical utility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Austin1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Dubinsky1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The design of an accurate test for IBD is challenging, since the precise cause of IBD is unknown. No single genetic, environmental or epidemiological factor alone is diagnostic of IBD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Bernstein1">[14]</xref>. Instead, current evidence about the aetiology of IBD points toward a complex interplay between genetic, environmental, and immunological factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Cho1">[15]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Baumgart1">[17]</xref> and the intestinal microbiota<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Dicksved1">[18]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Sartor2">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Arguing in favour of the involvement of gut microbes in the pathogenesis of IBD, it is known that colonisation with commensal bacteria is required to elicit colitis in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Sartor1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Kim1">[21]</xref>. Similarly, in IBD patients it is known that antibiotics can treat CD colitis in the short term <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Selby1">[22]</xref> and probiotics may prevent relapse of UC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Bhm1">[23]</xref>. We hypothesized that changes in the intestinal microbiota, whether causative of or responsive to disease, may provide a viable diagnostic of disease status.</p>
      <p>Previous microbial diversity studies have found characteristic changes in the composition of the gut flora during IBD that could potentially be used to screen patients with non-specific symptoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Dicksved1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Frank1">[24]</xref>. In one of the most comprehensive studies to date, Frank and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Frank1">[24]</xref> mapped microbiota composition in 124 IBD and non-IBD patients by biopsy sampling coupled with 16S rRNA sequencing. Their work showed that patients with a long-standing history of IBD had decreased levels of Firmicutes and increased level of Proteobacteria, when compared to control individuals. While these results firmly established the relationship between GI microbiota and disease status, the overall approach is unsatisfactory as a diagnostic tool because of low sensitivity (31%) and low overall accuracy (51%, as determined from the third figure in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Frank1">[24]</xref>).</p>
      <p>More recent studies have been able to accurately distinguish CD and healthy individuals on the basis of pyrosequencing data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Willing1">[25]</xref>, but the same model was unable to distinguish UC from healthy individuals or to differentiate patients in remission from patients with active disease, raising questions about whether such approaches show clinical potential. Finally, none of these studies examined pediatric cohorts.</p>
      <p>Here we demonstrate an approach that is capable of routinely differentiating children with IBD from controls with other gastrointestinal diseases in a case-control study of ninety-one pediatric patients. Our methodology shows high sensitivity and specificity over a range of disease prevalence and it can be used to i) identify key taxa associated with each disease state, ii) discriminate CD and UC and iii) differentiate patients with active disease from those in remission. We confirmed our results by blind validation with an independent cohort of seventy-seven pediatric patients. This method applies next-generation sequencing and robust statistical analysis using machine learning techniques and, significantly, is a test for IBD based on non-invasive fecal sampling.</p>

        <title>Supervised Classification Distinguishes IBD and Non-IBD Patients in Existing Tissue-based Studies</title>
        <p>The case-control study of Frank and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Frank1">[24]</xref> used an unsupervised clustering approach: principal components analysis (PCA). When the class labels (healthy vs. diseased) are known for a training set of samples, then supervised learning methods can also be applied (e.g. support vector machines, random forests, etc.). These algorithms have been widely and successfully applied to many problems in the biomedical sciences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Baldi1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Tarca1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-BenHur1">[28]</xref> and their use in a clinical setting is emerging in the analysis of gene expression data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Shipp1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Parsons1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Liang1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Tomas1">[32]</xref> and microbiome data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Knights1">[33]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We first investigated whether supervised learning could offer sufficient performance to be employed in a microbiota-based IBD detection tool, by applying it to the published IBD data set of Frank et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Frank1">[24]</xref>. We employed our Synthetic Learning in Microbial Ecology (SLiME) method to classify samples from the existing data set as IBD or control. SLiME is a software pipeline which applies supervised classification algorithm to sequencing data, using associated metadata as the classification label. Demultiplexed sequences are classified into lineages, clustered to select a representative set and used to estimate the abundance of each taxa in each sample. The resulting frequency table is normalized and fed to a supervised classification algorithm. SLiME is based on Random Forests (RFs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Liaw1">[34]</xref>, which we chose for its accuracy and speed, although we achieved similar results using other supervised learning approaches such as bagging, stacking and support vector machines (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039242.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Applying SLiME to the existing data set yielded accurate classification of patients into IBD or non-IBD groups. Based on repeated ten-fold cross validation, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) â€“ which is a measure of the overall accuracy of the classification algorithm over the range of possible disease incidence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Bradley1">[35]</xref> â€“ was 0.73 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039242-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Choosing a cutoff on the curve which gives relatively high sensitivity (ie. 87.6%) yields 47.3% specificity, amply surpassing the accuracy of the clustering method originally employed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Frank1">[24]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Supervised Classification Distinguishes IBD and Non-IBD Pediatric Patients on the Basis of Stool</title>
        <p>Although the results obtained using the existing Frank et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Frank1">[24]</xref> data set were encouraging, there are several reasons why they might not translate to a clinically useful diagnostic test. First, samples were obtained invasively through surgical tissue resection from adult patients with advanced disease, and may not reflect changes observed in fecal samples from patients with less advanced disease. Second, the control specimens in the Frank et al. study were largely composed of tissue from cancer patients, and thus were not typical of patients investigated for IBD in the pediatric setting. We therefore designed a new case-control study to evaluate whether fecal samples from children not undergoing surgery could be utilized to differentiate between patients with and without IBD.</p>
        <p>We selected a group of ninety-one children and young adults receiving care in the gastroenterology program of Childrenâ€™s Hospital (Boston, USA), and obtained fecal samples. Of these children, 23 had Crohnâ€™s disease, 43 had ulcerative colitis, one had undefined IBD (colitis with elements of CD and UC) and 24 had non-IBD functional disease (patients with gastrointestinal symptoms but no intestinal inflammation). To evaluate the potential of our method to differentiate between children with IBD and children without IBD, we thought it essential to study not completely healthy children, but children with gastrointestinal symptoms. These are the children who would present to the gastroenterologist for evaluation, and for whom IBD is in the differential diagnosis. Demographics of the patient populations are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0039242-t001">Table 1</xref>. We isolated DNA from the fecal samples and sequenced a portion of the 16S rRNA gene using high throughput 454 pyrosequencing (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). We then applied SLiME to the resulting microbial compositional data.</p>

        <p>Remarkably, performance of our method improved on this data set despite the substitution of mucosal samples with stool samples, yielding a ten-fold cross-validated AUC of 0.83 for distinguishing IBD patients from controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039242-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Sensitivity and specificity for the diagnostic test can be obtained by selecting the desired threshold along the curve. For instance, choosing a cutoff on the curve at relatively high sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039242-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, circle) yields 80.3% sensitivity and 69.7% specificity for the test. The result is particularly remarkable considering that fecal samples may not be truly representative of the total intestinal microbiota. Indeed, bacteria living in association with the intestinal epithelium, and thus capable of interacting with innate immune receptors, are likely not to be present in fecal samples.</p>
        <p>The performance of the same classification algorithm was higher when it was applied to distinguish from controls only those IBD patients with clinically active disease, yielding an AUC of 0.91 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039242-g001">Fig. 1B</xref> dashed line). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039242.s020">Table S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039242.s021">S7</xref> show how the classifier performs amongst the three disease groups (CD,UC and control) at one arbitrary threshold. To test if the chosen sequencing technology altered the classification of patients into controls and IBD samples, we repeated sequencing for 10 of the samples using the Sanger sequencing method. Supervised learning results, however, were independent of the sequencing method employed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039242.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). We hypothesized that some of the improvement in performance might be due to increased sampling depth if a subset of discriminatory bacteria are present at low abundance. To test this hypothesis, we identified the bacterial taxa most strongly associated with IBD (either positively or negatively), and plotted their abundance. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039242.s003">Fig. S3</xref>, many of the most informative taxa are present at a level of less than 1% per sample â€“ the level at which we would expect to see one count or less at the sequencing depth used in Frank et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Frank1">[24]</xref>. Thus, sequencing depth is an important factor in diagnostic accuracy and may account to a large degree for the lower AUC we obtained in the classification of the Frank et al. data set.</p>

        <title>Distinctive Taxonomical Groups are Associated with IBD</title>
        <p>We identified a number of bacterial taxa strongly associated with IBD that both confirmed and supplemented previous studies. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039242-g002">Fig. 2</xref> shows taxa that are significantly associated with either IBD or control patients (q-value &lt;0.01, Kruskal-Wallis test, FDR adjusted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Storey1">[36]</xref>, E(Ï€<sub>0</sub>)â€Š=â€Š0.18, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039242.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). Only a few of these taxa show a distribution consistent with an ideal microbial biomarker â€“ a bacterial group whose presence/absence indicates disease phenotype. For example, the Enterobacteriales are indicators of active IBD (ie. patients with clinically active disease and not in remission), while Rikenellaceae and Porphyromonadaceae are generally found within the control group. By contrast, most of the discriminatory groups in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039242-g002">Fig. 2</xref> are more or less abundant in IBD patients, but not exclusive to one population (e.g., the Butyricicoccus and Subdoligranum genera decrease in the IBD patients with clinically active disease, but are still present in some IBD patients with inactive disease). This highlights the need for quantitative global surveys of microbial diversity rather than simple indicators of presence/absence.</p>

        <title>Microbial Alterations are Similar in Stool and Tissue Samples</title>
        <p>Our finding that classification was similarly accurate in tissue and stool samples led us to ask whether the same alterations in the gut profile were observed in both sample types or whether distinct but similarly predictive changes occurred in each. To test this, we used the bacterial taxa identified in the pediatric case-control (stool-based) study to re-classify the tissue samples in the study by Frank et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Frank1">[24]</xref> The classification accuracy based on features from the pediatric study was nearly identical to the model using features picked from the tissue-based study: AUC â€Š=â€Š0.71 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039242-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), an increase in estimated measurement error of only 3%.</p>
        <p>The relative change (upwards or downwards) of taxa in IBD vs. control groups is remarkably concordant between the two studies, with the exception of Lactobacillales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039242-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Unsurprisingly, due to the largely different sequencing depth many of the low-abundance taxa detected in the pediatric case-control (e.g., Alistipes) are of little importance in the classification, when applied to the Frank et al. data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039242.s005">Fig. S5</xref>). On the other hand, the Subdoligranulum genus and the Proteobacteria phylum remain two consistently important features across data sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039242-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). These results are encouraging because they suggest stool samples can be used to study changes in other compartments such as the mucosa.</p>

        <title>Microbiota Diversity Decreases as Disease Severity Increases</title>
        <p>An important clinical question is to establish whether a marker of disease activity exists, and to what extent it can be used to stratify patients according to disease severity. To address this question, we measured disease activity by means of standard clinical indices (PUCAI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Turner1">[37]</xref>, PCDAI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Turner2">[38]</xref>), based on symptoms and blood test results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Griffiths1">[39]</xref>, and compared to SLiME predictions. While SLiME could not reliably classify on the basis of activity due to the small number of patients in each distinct level of disease severity, we nevertheless observed that overall microbiota diversity was strongly associated with disease activity. As disease severity increased, independently of the type of disease (CD or UC), overall bacterial diversity decreased as measured by the Shannon diversity index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039242-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). These results further support the view that IBD reflects an overall GI tract dysbiosis rather than the effect of a small number of pathogenic taxa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Sartor2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Frank1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Tamboli1">[40]</xref>. Moreover, a number of microbial taxa showed significant association with disease activity levels. Among the most discriminative taxa was the Proteobacteria phylum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039242-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039242.s006">Fig. S6</xref>).

        <title>Gut Microbiota Shows Characteristic Changes from Active Disease to Remission</title>
        <p>The factors responsible for triggering episodes of active disease are largely unknown. To identify microbial groups potentially associated with the establishment of active disease, we compared the composition of bacteria in fecal samples taken during active disease and remission periods. Classification with SLiME could distinguish between active and remission samples with an AUC of 0.72. Amongst the taxa which were significantly associated with active disease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039242.s007">Fig. S7</xref>) we found Proteobacteria (q-value &lt;0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test, FDR adjusted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Storey1">[36]</xref>, E(Ï€0)â€Š=â€Š0.35, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039242.s008">Fig. S8</xref>) which was in agreement with previous observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Sepehri1">[41]</xref>. This finding appears to confirm the hypothesis that before or during active disease Proteobacteria rapidly expand and potentially displace other bacterial groups, such as Actinobacteria. On the other hand, members of the Eubacteriaceae, Incertae Sedis XIV and Bifidobacteriaceae families were associated with remission, which to our knowledge has not been reported previously. The Lachnospiraceae family, Subdoligranulum and Butyricicoccus, a butyrate-producing organism that can ferment dietary polysaccharides, were also associated with remission.</p>

        <p>We found that overall microbial diversity, as measured by the Shannon diversity index, was the single most important feature for discriminating between patients undergoing antibiotic therapy or not. Although we could not classify whether samples were obtained from antibiotic-treated patients with high accuracy (AUC &lt;0.6), we did find that Shannon diversity index was significantly and negatively associated with antibiotic therapy in the IBD samples (p-value â€Š=â€Š0.0067, Wilcoxon test, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039242.s009">Fig. S9</xref>).

        <p>Ulcerative colitis is generally limited to the colon, while intestinal inflammation in Crohnâ€™s disease may occur in any region of the gastrointestinal tract. Classification of pediatric IBD patients into UC or CD at the time of fecal testing is desirable, given the different clinical management of the two diseases.

When we excluded controls from the data and attempted to distinguish between CD and UC in all IBD patients, we were able to do so with accuracies (AUCâ€Š=â€Š0.76,ie. a specificity of 49% at 95% sensitivity) superior to current noninvasive clinical methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Dubinsky1">[13]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Classification in CD or UC performed differently depending on whether the patient was experiencing active disease or remission, and surprisingly was more accurate at distinguishing CD and UC patients in remission (AUCâ€Š=â€Š0.73) than for patients with active disease (AUCâ€Š=â€Š0.67). This finding suggests that changes in microbiota composition during acute inflammation may be similar in both UC and CD, rendering distinction by microbial diversity more challenging.</p>

        <title>Blind Validation with an Independent Patient Sample Confirms the Accuracy of Supervised Classification</title>
        <p>To confirm the general validity of our results, we selected an independent patient sample of 68 children and young adults. Following fecal sampling and 16S rRNA sequencing, we applied SLiME â€“ trained on our initial pediatric cohort â€“ to the new dataset.

        <title>Classification by SLiME is Comparable to Testing by Fecal Calprotectin</title>
        <p>We compared the accuracy of SLiME with the outcome of the fecal calprotectin test on a portion of our samples from both the pediatric cohort and the validation cohort, to determine how our method compared to the most clinically accepted non-invasive test for IBD. On those 120 samples where we could obtain calprotectin measurements retrospectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039242.s023">Table S9</xref>), we found that SLiME could classify the samples as IBD with comparable accuracy to calprotectin (AUC â€Š=â€Š0.85 compared to calprotectinâ€™s AUC of 0.77). Superposing the two ROC curves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039242.s013">Fig. S13</xref>) shows that SLiME is slightly more specific, but otherwise comparable to calprotectin. Given that calprotectin levels should be raised in both CD and UC patients, it is not surprising that SLiME could distinguish CD samples from UC samples better than calprotectin (AUC 0.69 compared to AUC 0.50 for calprotectin, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039242.s014">Fig. S14</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Delay in the diagnosis of pediatric IBD is likely due to the non-specific presentation of the disease. An inexpensive and sensitive diagnostic tool could reduce this delay by rapidly identifying patients at high risk for IBD and, therefore, warranting endoscopic evaluation. In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of a new approach to detecting pediatric IBD based on analysis of fecal microbiota. The sensitivity and specificity of our approach, as measured by ROC curve analysis, matches or surpasses that of alternative methods proposed for clinical use.</p>
      <p>Two key methodological advances are responsible for improved performance compared to previous studies. These include the SLiME software package, which is freely available for public use, and increased sampling depth, which allows low abundance but highly informative groups to be sampled. The advantages of employing machine learning methods to analyze microbiome data have already been discussed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Knights1">[33]</xref>. Compared to clustering methods, machine learning excels in classifying unlabelled data and extracting pivotal features from large and complex data sets. SLiME is a pipeline which allows the routine application of these algorithms to microbiome data.</p>
      <p>Previous surveys of microbial diversity in IBD relied on clustering analyses to differentiate between IBD and non-IBD samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Dicksved1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Frank1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Sepehri1">[41]</xref>. As a result, these studies suffered from poor sensitivity and, more importantly, did not generate predictive models that could be employed to distinguish new unlabelled samples. In this study, we employed SLiME to achieve high sensitivity as well as high specificity in differentiating IBD samples from controls. Models generated by SLiME were capable of classifying unlabelled samples with accuracy, as demonstrated by the large AUC obtained both after cross-validation and after blind validation with an independent cohort. Importantly, our approach was effective across disparate data sets using different sample types, and processing and sequencing technologies. Finally, we generated a list of taxa specifically associated with each disease state (active IBD, remission samples, CD and UC) facilitating biological interpretation.</p>
      <p>Although we succesfully employed specific taxa as predictive biomarkers, our results indicate that IBD reflects an overall GI tract dysbiosis rather than the effect of a small number of pathogenic taxa. This result is in agreement with previous observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Sartor2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Frank1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Tamboli1">[40]</xref> and suggests that a global community survey rather than a test for bacterial presence/absence is better suited to identifying IBD.</p>
      <p>Departing from the traditional clustering analysis, a recent and promising study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Willing1">[25]</xref> showed the use of a predictive model in classifying samples as IBD on the basis of microbial diversity. However, the same study arised concerns regarding a) the ability to distinguish UC patients from controls and b) the ability to discriminate between samples from patients with active disease and those in remission. Our study answers these questions, and importantly we report only cross-validated results that should more closely reflect accuracy in a clinical setting.</p>
      <p>Some potential limitations in our study stem from its relatively small scale. For instance, while we are able to succesfully distinguish both UC and CD patients, SLiME appears to classify UC patients more succesfully than CD patients. However, we find that this difference in performance disappears after downsampling, confirming that it is probably due to the uneven split between CD and UC patients in our training cohort.</p>
      <p>We also attempted to find correlations between therapeutic regimens (antibiotics, salicylates, anti-TNF, methotrexate, etc.) and microbial composition. Unfortunately SLiME was not capable to differentiate between subgroups with different therapeutic regimens, most likely due to the broad range of treatments employed in our cohort and the small number of patients in each subgroup. While these results indicate that SLiME may not be influenced by different therapeutic interventions while differentiating patients with IBD from controls, recruiting a larger number of patients following similar therapeutic regimens would have allowed to identify key microbial changes brought about by the therapy.</p>
      <p>It is arguable that both these potential limitations will be addressed by studies with larger patient samples, better suited to compare alternatives in disease behaviour and therapeutic management of IBD. In addition, a cross-sectional study design on fecal samples taken at the time of diagnosis and before the start of any therapy, rather than the case-control study we employed, would allow to estimate more precisely the sensitivity of SLiME when employed in the general population.</p>
      <p>Even though our results demonstrate the potential of the gastrointestinal microbiome as a diagnostic tool in IBD, further validation will be necessary before this tool is accepted into clinical practice. Our comparison between SLiME and calprotectin is encouraging, insofar as it shows that the two methods have comparable accuracies on this data set. However, other IBD fecal biomarkers â€“ such as C-reactive protein, fecal lactoferrin, fecal calprotectin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-Lewis1">[10]</xref> â€“ and blood biomarkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039242-CabreraAbreu1">[42]</xref> have shown high sensitivity in IBD diagnosis. Further comparison of SLiME against these biomarkers in larger patient samples will allow clinicians to gauge the relative benefits of each method.</p>
      <p>Despite these limitations, our results demonstrate the considerable potential of microbiome-based diagnostics in the clinic, particularly in the case of pediatric patients where diagnosis is often challenging. Similar approaches could evaluate the efficacy of novel therapies (e.g. probiotics, antibodies), predict the outcome of disease and forecast the timings of flare-ups. While not replacing endoscopy and histological examination as diagnostic tools, we propose that classification based on microbial diversity can be included as an effective complementary technique to aid in the diagnosis of IBD, particularly in pediatric patients.</p>
