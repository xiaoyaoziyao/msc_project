          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are getting increased attention as
                        one of the main regulatory cells of the immune system. They are induced at
                        sites of inflammation and can potently suppress T cell functions. In the
                        current study, we demonstrate how activation of TRPV1 vanilloid receptors
                        can trigger MDSCs, which in turn, can inhibit inflammation and
                        hepatitis.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>Polyclonal activation of T cells, following injection of concanavalin A
                        (ConA), in C57BL/6 mice caused acute hepatitis, characterized by significant
                        increase in aspartate transaminase (AST), induction of inflammatory
                        cytokines, and infiltration of mononuclear cells in the liver, leading to
                        severe liver injury. Administration of cannabidiol (CBD), a natural
                        non-psychoactive cannabinoid, after ConA challenge, inhibited hepatitis in a
                        dose-dependent manner, along with all of the associated inflammation
                        markers. Phenotypic analysis of liver infiltrating cells showed that
                        CBD-mediated suppression of hepatitis was associated with increased
                        induction of arginase-expressing CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup>
                        MDSCs. Purified CBD-induced MDSCs could effectively suppress T cell
                        proliferation in vitro in arginase-dependent manner. Furthermore, adoptive
                        transfer of purified MDSCs into naïve mice conferred significant
                        protection from ConA-induced hepatitis. CBD failed to induce MDSCs and
                        suppress hepatitis in the livers of vanilloid receptor-deficient mice
                            (TRPV1<sup>−/−</sup>) thereby suggesting that CBD primarily
                        acted via this receptor to induce MDSCs and suppress hepatitis. While MDSCs
                        induced by CBD in liver consisted of granulocytic and monocytic subsets at a
                        ratio of ∼2∶1, the monocytic MDSCs were more immunosuppressive
                        compared to granulocytic MDSCs. The ability of CBD to induce MDSCs and
                        suppress hepatitis was also demonstrable in Staphylococcal enterotoxin
                        B-induced liver injury.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
          <p>This study demonstrates for the first time that MDSCs play a critical role in
                        attenuating acute inflammation in the liver, and that agents such as CBD,
                        which trigger MDSCs through activation of TRPV1 vanilloid receptors may
                        constitute a novel therapeutic modality to treat inflammatory diseases.</p>

                clinical use in some countries for the treatment of pain in multiple sclerosis (MS)
                patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Wade1">[5]</xref>. In
                addition to MS, CBD has shown promise in several rodent models of inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Costa1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Pan1">[10]</xref>. A single dose of
                CBD has been shown to suppress serum TNF-α production induced by
                lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mice and has been found to be beneficial in murine
                collagen-induced arthritis by inhibiting IFN-γ production and T cell
                proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Malfait1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Hepatitis is the inflammation of the liver that can be caused by various agents such
                as viruses, chemicals, drugs, alcohol, genetic factors, or the patient's own
                immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Czaja1">[11]</xref>.
                The inflammation can be acute, flaring up and then resolving within a few weeks to
                months, or chronic, enduring over many years. Chronic hepatitis may simmer for 20
                years or more before causing significant symptoms related to advanced liver damage
                such as cirrhosis (scarring and liver failure), liver cancer, or death. American
                liver foundation estimates that one in every 10 people in North America is afflicted
                with a liver, biliary or gallbladder disease.</p>
      <p>Hepatitis represents a worldwide health problem in humans for which pharmacological
                treatments currently available are not adequate. Development of new drugs, however,
                requires proper animal models relevant to human hepatitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Tiegs1">[12]</xref>. Majority of the liver diseases
                such as viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), primary biliary cirrhosis,
                primary sclerosing cholangitis, and liver allograft rejection are caused by
                activated T lymphocytes that infiltrate and destroy liver parenchyma leading to
                liver injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Eggink1">[13]</xref>.
                Injection of mice with the T-cell mitogenic plant lectin Concanavalin A (ConA),
                results in polyclonal activation of T lymphocytes leading to liver selective
                inflammatory response, which mimics activated T-cell mediated hepatitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Tiegs2">[14]</xref>. ConA-induced
                hepatitis has been well established as an ideal animal model to study T-cell
                mediated hepatic injury and has been used extensively to elucidate various aspects
                of human T cell-mediated liver diseases, such as AIH and viral hepatitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Tiegs2">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Wahl1">[20]</xref>. It is
                characterized by elevated levels of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine
                transaminase (ALT) enzyme activities, and inflammatory cytokines in blood and liver.
                Histologically, ConA injection induces dramatic inflammatory infiltrates in the
                liver, particularly T cells. In this model, liver injury occurs without
                sensitization or priming as compared to other models of liver inflammation such as
                galactosamine-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced hepatitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Galanos1">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), are a newly identified suppressor cells of
                myeloid lineage which co-express CD11b and Gr-1 antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Bronte1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Gabrilovich1">[23]</xref>. These cells, originally
                identified in tumor bearing hosts, have been shown to possess potent suppressive
                functions and regulate inflammatory responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Dugast1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Haile1">[25]</xref>. Although, cannabidiol is known
                to be highly immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory, its effect on this important
                suppressive cell population has not been investigated.</p>
      <p>Autoimmune hepatitis is generally treated with medications that suppress the immune
                system, such as prednisone and azathioprine, although these treatments are not
                universally effective and long term side effects exist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Luxon1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Manns1">[27]</xref>. New treatments, vaccines, and
                prevention strategies for hepatitis continue to emerge. Here, we describe our
                finding that a single dose of CBD is effective in significantly suppressing
                ConA-induced T cell-mediated hepatic inflammation in mice. Importantly, we have
                identified a novel pathway through which CBD suppresses hepatitis involving the
                induction of MDSCs in liver following activation of vanilloid receptor, TRPV1. These
                observations will help in developing CBD as a potential drug to treat inflammatory
                liver diseases.</p>

        <title>Cannabidiol suppresses ConA-induced hepatitis</title>
        <p>A single injection of concanavalin-A (ConA) has been shown to induce hepatitis in
                    mice mimicking the symptoms of human autoimmune hepatitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Tiegs2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Mizuhara1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Satoh1">[18]</xref>. Acute liver
                    inflammation occurs within 8–24 h of injecting ConA, with clinical and
                    histological evidence of hepatitis, elevation of transaminase activities in the
                    plasma and hepatic inflammatory lesions characterized by massive leukocyte
                    accumulation and hepatic necrosis. In this study, we investigated if CBD can be
                    used to treat hepatitis using this model. WT mice were injected with PBS
                    (vehicle), or ConA to induce hepatitis. ConA injected mice were administered
                        (<italic>i.p.</italic>) with vehicle (ConA+veh group) or different
                    doses of CBD, ranging from 5 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg body wt (ConA+CBD groups), 5
                    minutes after ConA injection. Some mice received CBD alone at the maximum dose
                    of 50 mg/kg (CBD group). Next, blood was collected at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h and
                    plasma AST (aspartate transaminase) was determined by spectrophotometry using
                    AST assay kit, as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Hegde1">[28]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018281-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, intravenous injection of ConA
                    resulted in dramatic increase in plasma AST levels over vehicle control,
                    indicative of acute hepatitis. Increased AST levels were seen as early as 6 h
                    after ConA injection, reaching a peak around 12 h and declining thereafter. At
                    48 h, the plasma AST reached normal levels. Mice which received both ConA and
                    cannabidiol (ConA+CBD) showed significantly less plasma AST activity
                    compared to ConA-injected (ConA+veh) group demonstrating reduced liver
                    injury upon CBD treatment. Cannabidiol alone injected at the maximum dose showed
                    AST levels similar to that of vehicle control at all-time points tested thereby
                    suggesting that CBD did not mediate any direct hepatotoxic effects.</p>

The increased presence of
                        CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup> cells in mice with hepatitis
                    suggested that such cells may represent immunosuppressive MDSCs and that they
                    may play a critical role in suppressing the acute inflammation and liver injury
                    as evidenced by the AST levels reaching normal levels by 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018281-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Furthermore, CBD may
                    promote the induction of such cells thereby further protecting the host from
                    acute hepatitis.</p>
        <p>In order to characterize the CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup> cells
                    found in the liver as MDSCs, we triple-stained the isolated infiltrating cells
                    for CD11b, Gr-1, and for the expression of intracellular arginase 1 (Arg1),
                    which is one of the characteristic features of MDSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018281-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). We found that
                        CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup> cells in all groups were
                        Arg-1<sup>+</sup>. However, CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup>
                    cells from ConA+CBD group showed increased Arg-1 expression as indicated by
                    higher mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). There was also a significant increase

        <title>Role of vanilloid receptors (TRPV1) in CBD-mediated suppression of liver
                    injury</title>
        <p>Next, we addressed the mechanism of action of CBD. CBD has been shown to
                    primarily function through vanilloid receptors (transient receptor potential
                    vanilloid1, TRPV1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Bisogno1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Costa3">[34]</xref>. To test the role of TRPV1 in this model, we used
                    vanilloid receptor knockout (TRPV1<sup>−/−</sup> or VR1-KO) mice.
                    VR1-KO mice developed hepatitis in response to ConA as indicated by increase in
                    AST levels, which was similar to that seen in ConA-injected wild-type (WT) mice
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018281-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). However,
                    unlike in WT mice, CBD was not able to suppress AST levels in VR1-KO mice,
                    suggesting a critical role for TRPV1 in mediating the anti-inflammatory activity
                    of CBD. Moreover, when we enumerated the number of MDSCs in the liver in this
                    experiment, CBD was able to induce MDSCs in ConA-injected WT but not VR1-KO mice
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018281-g007">Fig. 7B &amp; C</xref>),
                    thereby suggesting that induction of MDSCs by CBD in the livers of hepatitis
                    mice was dependent on TRPV1 receptors. It was interesting to note that
                    administration of ConA alone also induced lower levels of MDSCs in the liver
                    which was similar in both WT and VR1-KO mice, suggesting that this response was
                    independent of TRPV1 receptor.</p>

        <p>We sought to see if the suppressive effect of CBD was specific to ConA-induced

                    To this end, we used Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B (SEB)-induced acute liver

      <p>ConA-induced hepatitis is a well-established model for hepatitis caused as a

                demonstrate for the first time that CBD, a non-psychoactive cannabinoid, can
                significantly reduce ConA-induced inflammation and protect the mice from acute liver
                injury, as indicated by marked decrease in plasma AST levels and necrotic lesions.
                We observed that a single dose of CBD as low as 20 mg/kg body weight was effective
                in this model. CBD is already approved for clinical use in Canada, in combination
                with THC under the trade name Sativex (GW Pharmaceuticals) to alleviate neuropathic
                pain, spasticity and overactive bladder in multiple sclerosis and also prescribed
                for cancer patients to reduce nausea and improve appetite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Wade1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Rog1">[38]</xref>. CBD is also in clinical trials to

                per day which is equivalent to 12.5 mg CBD per day as a long term treatment. In one
                of the earliest double-blind studies on CBD, normal volunteers received 3 mg/kg
                daily CBD for 30 days and epileptic patients received 200–300 mg per day for
                up to 4 1/2 months without any signs of toxicity or serious side effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Cunha1">[41]</xref>. The study
                concluded that CBD was effective as an anti-epileptic drug or as a potentiating
                agent for other epileptic drugs compared to placebo. In another randomized
                double-blind controlled study of Huntington disease patients, CBD was given orally
                at an average daily dose of 700 mg/day for six weeks, where it was found neither
                symptomatically effective nor toxic relative to placebo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Consroe1">[42]</xref>. In the current study, we used
                a single dose of CBD at 20–50 mg/kg body weight in mice, which showed
                significant efficacy in an acute inflammation model. This dose converts to
                1.6–4.1 mg/kg of human equivalent dose (HUD) based on body surface area
                normalization (BSA) method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-ReaganShaw1">[43]</xref>, and translates to a single dose of 96–246 mg in an
                average individual of 60 kg, which seems to be safe and acceptable dose based on
                several previous studies in humans mentioned above.</p>
      <p>ConA-induced hepatitis is primarily mediated by activated T cells and NKT cells, and
                the induction of hepatitis is associated with the surge in the production of various
                pro-inflammatory cytokines. TNF-α and IFN-γ are the first cytokines produced
                after ConA injection, and are the most critical in inducing hepatitis as anti-TNF
                and anti-IFN-γ antibodies confer protection against the disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Mizuhara1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Mizuhara2">[44]</xref>. We found

                of the infiltrating cells in the CBD treated group consisted of MDSCs. MDSCs express
                arginase which can metabolize and deplete L-Arginine, an essential amino acid
                required for the proliferation and function of T cells. This seems to be the primary

                arginase enzyme activity assay based on the conversion of L-arginine to L-ornithine,
                we demonstrated that CBD-induced MDSCs in liver expressed functionally active
                arginase. Purified MDSCs from CBD treated mice were able to suppress ConA-stimulated
                T cell proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic> in Arg-1 dependent manner. <italic>In
                    vivo,</italic> the suppressive activity of adoptively transferred MDSCs could be
                demonstrated in models of inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Sander1">[49]</xref> and cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Tomihara1">[50]</xref>. In the
                current model, we showed that the adoptively transferred MDSCs induced by CBD were
                able to significantly protect mice from ConA-hepatitis, thereby conclusively
                demonstrating that CBD-induced MDSCs were indeed functional and can suppress
                hepatitis. It should be noted that ConA-induced hepatitis by itself showed a small
                increase in the number of MDSCs in livers. This may be a natural mechanism following
                inflammatory stimuli to regulate inflammation. Such MDSCs may play a crucial role in
                helping the host recover from inflammation as evidenced by the restoration of AST
                levels to basal levels by 48 h. Nevertheless, CBD treatment further triggered the
                induction of MDSCs which also expressed higher density of Arg-1. It is interesting
                to note that CBD alone did not induce any MDSCs in liver of naïve mice. We
                speculate that CBD triggers the induction of MDSCs only when there is an insult or
                inflammation in the liver.</p>
      <p>Cannabidiol has been shown to bind and function primarily through TRPV1 or vanilloid
                receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Bisogno1">[33]</xref>,
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Costa3">[34]</xref>. Vanilloid
                receptors mediate anti-hyperalgesic effect of CBD, in a rat model of acute
                inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Costa3">[34]</xref>.
                TRPV1 ion channels also mediate the response to painful heat, extracellular
                acidosis, and capsaicin, the pungent compound from plants which upon prolonged use
                decreases TRPV1 activity by a phenomenon called desensitization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Rosenbaum1">[51]</xref>. CBD
                possesses no, or very weak affinity for the central and peripheral canabbinoid
                receptors (CB1 and CB2) and is not psychoactive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Bisogno1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Showalter1">[52]</xref>. Use of vanilloid receptor
                knock-out mice in our study clearly showed that CBD induced suppression of
                inflammation in ConA-hepatitis was dependent on TRPV1, so was the induction of MDSCs
                by CBD in the livers of ConA-injected mice. Recently, we demonstrated that
                activation of cannabinoid receptors can trigger massive induction of
                immunosuppressive MDSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018281-Hegde2">[53]</xref>. We noted this was dependent on the production of G-CSF.
                In the current study, we tested if some specific chemokine or cytokine may be
                involved in TRPV1-mediated induction or accumulation of MDSCs by CBD in liver. Our
                attempt to identify such factor, particularly looking at GM-CSF, G-CSF, and KC by
                ELISA was not conclusive (data not shown). Even though there was a significant
                increase in G-CSF 24 h after CBD treatment of hepatitis corresponding with increase
                in number of MDSCs in liver as well as decrease in liver enzymes (inflammatory
                marker), blocking studies with anti-G-CSF Ab failed to reverse the CBD effect.</p>
      <p>Finally, we showed that CBD-induced suppression of acute liver inflammation is not
                specific to ConA-induced hepatitis, but it is also equally effective in other acute
                hepatitis models such as sensitization with GalN followed by induction of liver
                inflammation by sub lethal doses of SEB. Overall, the current study demonstrates
                that MDSCs may play a critical role in protecting the liver from acute inflammation.
                The most interesting observation in this study was robust induction of
                    CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup> MDSCs by CBD in the livers of
                ConA-induced mice that were immunosuppressive, which protected mice from hepatitis
                upon adoptive transfer. Moreover, CBD was found to induce MDSCs following activation
                of TRPV1 inasmuch as, CBD failed to trigger MDSCs in the livers of TRPV1 deficient
                mice and failed to protect them from hepatitis. Together, these studies not only
                demonstrate that CBD can protect the host from acute liver injury but also provide
                evidence for the first time that MDSCs may play a critical role in protecting the
                liver from acute inflammation. Non-psychoactive cannabinoids such as CBD possess
                great therapeutic potential in treating various inflammatory liver diseases,
                including autoimmune hepatitis.</p>
