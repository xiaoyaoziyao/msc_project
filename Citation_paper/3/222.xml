<title>Background</title>
<p>Microscopic techniques enable real-space imaging of complex biological events and processes. They have become an essential tool to confirm and complement hypotheses made by biomedical scientists and also allow the re-examination of existing models, hence influencing future investigations. Particularly imaging live cells is crucial for an improved understanding of dynamic biological processes, however hitherto live cell imaging has been limited by the necessity to introduce probes within a cell without altering its physiological and structural integrity. We demonstrate herein that this hurdle can be overcome by effective cytosolic delivery.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Principal Findings</title>
<p>We show the delivery within several types of mammalian cells using nanometre-sized biomimetic polymer vesicles (a.k.a. polymersomes) that offer both highly efficient cellular uptake and endolysomal escape capability without any effect on the cellular metabolic activity. Such biocompatible polymersomes can encapsulate various types of probes including cell membrane probes and nucleic acid probes as well as labelled nucleic acids, antibodies and quantum dots.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Significance</title>
<p>We show the delivery of sufficient quantities of probes to the cytosol, allowing sustained functional imaging of live cells over time periods of days to weeks. Finally the combination of such effective staining with three-dimensional imaging by confocal laser scanning microscopy allows cell imaging in complex three-dimensional environments under both mono-culture and co-culture conditions. Thus cell migration and proliferation can be studied in models that are much closer to the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Among the various microscopic techniques available, fluorescence microscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-LansingTaylor1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Coling1">[2]</xref> (FM) has been by far the most influential. This technique allows both structural and functional information relating to cells and tissues to be obtained for routine and also more complex analysis. FM is now used in all aspects of the life sciences and has been exploited by the physical sciences as well. Over the last few decades, technological advances include total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-AmbroseE1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Lewis1">[4]</xref>, confocal laser scanning microscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Brakenhoff1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Pawley1">[6]</xref>, two-photon imaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Denk1">[7]</xref>, single molecule fluorescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Schmidt1">[8]</xref>, Förster energy transfer imaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-JaresErijman1">[9]</xref>, fluorescence lifetime imaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Gadella1">[10]</xref>. Most recently, new fluorescence techniques have been developed that allow nanometer resolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Hell1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Hell3">[13]</xref>, enabling researchers to study complex biological processes in unprecedented detail. An essential aspect of FM is the fluorescence probe itself. Indeed, either a positive (i.e. functional imaging) or a negative (i.e. cytotoxicity) interaction between the probe and the biological environment dictates the correct choice of probe. New probes have been designed to target specific biological sites and/or to produce measurable signals that can be directly correlated to biological function and/or activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Johnson1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-FernndezSurez1">[16]</xref>. In addition to its spectroscopic characteristics and interaction with its biological target, the selected probe must also be introduced within cells. In particular, live cell imaging is crucial for an improved understanding of dynamic biological processes; this technique clearly requires probes that can be delivered within a cell without altering its physiological and structural integrity.</p>
<p>Penetration of the cell membrane depends on both the size and polarity of the probe. Small lipophilic molecules normally diffuse across the membrane quite readily, while large, polar molecules often require membrane permeabilization. However, this approach is typically either confined to one cell at time (i.e. microinjection) or compromised by cytotoxicity or other unwanted side effects (e.g. cellular stress, inflammation etc) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Johnson1">[14]</xref>. Recently, live cell imaging has benefited tremendously from the discovery of fluorescence proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Chalfie1">[17]</xref>. These proteins can be designed to absorb and emit light at different wavelengths, providing biologists with a wide colour palette <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Shaner1">[18]</xref>. Genetic manipulation allows fluorescence proteins to be expressed within live cells and/or associated with specific sub-cellular compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Shaner1">[18]</xref>. Although fluorescence proteins are clearly a very valuable life science tool, their use is currently limited by their genetic expression within cells. Indeed, the exact localisation and efficiency of such proteins is limited by the requirement to genetically modify the host cell. Notwithstanding the substantial advances made with both viral <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Thomas1">[19]</xref> and non-viral <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Glover1">[20]</xref> transfection vectors, the expression of fluorescence proteins remains experimentally challenging.</p>
<p>Herein we propose a novel approach to introduce fluorescent probes within live cells that allows both the topological and temporal monitoring of cells in 2D monolayer and 3D environments. We have recently engineered polymer nanoparticles based on the self-assembly of block copolymers to form nanometer-sized vesicles (a.k.a. polymersomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Discher1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-LoPresti1">[23]</xref>) that are rapidly taken up by many different cell types, with subsequent intracellular release of their payload <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Lomas1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Massignani1">[26]</xref>. We have demonstrated effective delivery of plasmid DNA to both primary cells and cell lines without altering their metabolic activity or even inducing pro-inflammatory reactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Lomas1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Lomas2">[25]</xref>. We can control the polymersome uptake kinetics by fine-tuning their surface chemistry, surface topology, and dimensions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Lomas2">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Massignani1">[26]</xref>.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Effective cytosolic delivery is achieved by the use of polymersomes comprising poly(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl phosphorylcholine)-poly(2-diisopropylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PMPC-PDPA) diblock copolymers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). The resulting polymersomes exhibit both cell affinity and pH-sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g001">Figure 1a</xref>), which are essential for (i) cell binding and (ii) escape from the endolysomal compartments. The pH sensitivity is essential to obtain high encapsulation. Our system is able to encapsulate efficiently both hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and amphiphilic structures as schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g001">Figure 1b</xref>. PMPC-PDPA copolymers were firstly dissolved in a glass vial in a 2∶1 chloroform: methanol solution. For samples encapsulating amphiphilic/hydrophobic molecules those compounds were added directly to the co-polymer chloroform: methanol solution. Subsequently, a copolymer film was formed by evaporating the solvent overnight in a vacuum oven at 37°C. The film was then rehydrated in neutral PBS for 24 hours under stirring. For encapsulating hydrophilic molecules the polymeric film was dissolved in acidic (pH 6) PBS after solvent removal. Once the film dissolved at pH 6 hydrophilic payload molecules were added. The pH of the resulting solution was raised to 7.3. Either the rehydration in neutral pH or the pH rise from 6 to 7.3 results in the formation of the polymersomes in water. The resulting polymersomes dispersions were sonicated for 15 minutes, extruded for 31 times using a 100 nm membrane and then purified by preparative gel permeation chromatography using a Sepharose 4B size exclusion column to extract the fraction containing polymersomes and remove any un-encapsulated materials.</p>

<p>The PMPC chains decorating the polymersome surface have a strong affinity for the cell membrane, thus facilitating efficient cellular uptake. Moreover, the pH-sensitive nature of the PDPA chains allows immediate polymersome dissociation once it is located within the endolysomal compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Lomas2">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Massignani1">[26]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g002">Figure 2a</xref>). This triggers a rapid build-up of osmotic pressure, leading to temporary membrane lysis and release of the polymersome payload within the cytosol. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g002">Figure 2b</xref>, primary human dermal fibroblast (HDF) cells exposed to Rhodamine-loaded polymersomes (0.005 mM) exhibit high levels of fluorescence from anywhere within their structure. Indeed, optical sections obtained by confocal laser scanning microscopy show that the dye (which otherwise would not gain entry to the cells –see control data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g002">figure 2b</xref>, dye control alone) is uniformly distributed within the cell volume. In these studies it is noteworthy that the cell lysosomes and DNA were stained with yellow Lysotracker and green SYTO-9, respectively.</p>

<p>We have reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Lomas1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Massignani1">[26]</xref> that these PMPC-PDPA polymersomes have no effect on cell viability. Provided that the fluorescent dye also has no detrimental effect, its combination with these polymersome allows fluorescence staining of live cells. This is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g003">Figure 3a</xref> in which a direct comparison is made with a commercial dye, CellTracker®. This is a membrane-permeable probe modified by the addition of a thiol-reactive chloromethyl substituent that facilitates conjugation with glutathione and other intracellular peptides. These dyes are routinely used for long-term tracing applications, such as tracking cell migration during development or after transplantation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Haugland1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Haugland2">[28]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g003">Figure 3a</xref>, the application of CellTracker® to live cells is limited by its toxicity, since cell viability falls to 50% after 24 hours exposure. In contrast, Rhodamine dye-loaded polymersomes, applied at the concentration tested in this work (0.005 mM), have no detrimental effect on cell viability and can be administered as multi-doses. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g003">Figure 3b</xref>, the fluorescence intensity exhibited by HDF cells plated at different initial densities and exposed to daily doses (0.005 mM) of Rhodamine-loaded polymersomes increases with time depending on the cell density. This indicates that Rhodamine-loaded polymersomes do not affect the cell viability and indeed the extent of cell proliferation. The better performance of the polymersomes as a cell tracker agent is also shown by the enhanced fluorescence intensity over time after a single dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g003">figure 3c–d</xref>).</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g003">Figure 3e–3n</xref>, polymersome-mediated staining is not limited to Rhodamine B dyes; efficient encapsulation of hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and amphiphilic dyes can also be achieved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-LoPresti1">[23]</xref>. These can therefore be chosen to target specific cell compartments such as the cell membranes using Rhodamine B octadecyl ester perchlorate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g003">Figure 3e</xref>), phospholipids, BODIPY TR ceramide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g003">Figure 3f</xref>) and Fluoresceine 1,2-dihexadecylphosphatidylethanolamine (DHPE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g003">Figure 3g</xref>), and labelled NBD cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g003">Figure 3h</xref>). Similarly, using the strong nucleic acid binder, Propidium Iodide, both DNA and RNA can be highlighted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g003">Figure 3i</xref>). One advantage of using these PMPC-PDPA polymersomes is their proven ability to encapsulate large macromolecules. Recently, we have demonstrated the encapsulation and delivery of antibodies within cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Battaglia1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Massignani2">[30]</xref>. The use of antibodies opens up the possibility of targeting almost any subcellular compartments for the functional imaging of live cells. This is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g003">Figure 3l</xref>, where effective staining of live HDF cell tubulin is achieved by delivering mouse monoclonal anti-human-a-tubulin FITC-labelled IgG (anti-human-a-tubulin). Similarly, we have demonstrated the effective delivery of nucleic acids with subsequent high transfection efficiencies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Lomas1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Lomas2">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Battaglia2">[31]</xref>. This allows the tracking of labelled nucleic acids, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g003">Figure 3m</xref>, which in principle enables the study of genetic expression, nucleic acid stability and mobility within the cytosol. Finally, we have encapsulated and delivered relatively large (about 2.6 nm) inorganic quantum dots (LumidotTM CdSe/ZnS) into cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g003">Figure 3n</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, we have confirmed efficient cellular uptake of polymersomes using 22 different types of animal and human cells, including both primary cells and cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Massignani1">[26]</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g004">Figure 4</xref>, selected examples of stained cells are shown, including primary human dermal fibroblast (HDF), primary human epidermal keratinocytes (HEK), primary human endothelial cells (HE), primary human monocytes (HMC), primary human macrophages (HMP), primary human mesenchymal stem cells (HMSc), primary rabbit limbal epithelial (RLE) cells, primary rat cortical neurons (RCN), primary rat motor neurons (RMN), Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, rat Shawnoma (Nemap22) cell, preosteocytes (MLO-A5) cells, human melanoma A375SM cells, human head &amp; neck cancer KB and SCC4 cells. In each case the live cells were imaged with no prior fixation. The combination of such effective fluorophore delivery with confocal laser scanning microscopy allows high quality acquisition of optical stacks and consequent 3D reconstruction. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g004">Figures 4b–e</xref>, this allows visualisation of a large number of structural details, such as the adhesion filipodia in both HDF and HE cells, the multinuclear nature of SCC4 cancer cells, and the formation of motoneuronal axon on RMN cells. Such fine details are only observed because relatively large quantities of fluorescence dye can be delivered to these cells without compromising their viability.</p>

<p>Polymersome-mediated staining combined with confocal laser scanning microscopy has also allowed us to image cells in complex 3D environments. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g005">Figure 5a–d</xref>, HDF cells can be imaged as cultured in 3D fibrin clot gels. The nanometer-sized polymersomes penetrate rapidly into the fibrin clot. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g005">Figure 5a</xref>, cell staining was efficient enough to allow visualisation after 7 days from cell seeding, both at the original cell seeding area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g005">Figure 5a</xref>) and also at the interface between the seeding area and the gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g005">Figure 5b</xref>). Facile application of the polymersomes allows the cell motility to be monitored in detail by fluorescence, as illustrated by the series of micrographs recorded for the cell seeding area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g005">Figure 5c</xref>) and also the cell moving across the seeding area and the interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g005">Figure 5d</xref>). This latter experiment shows the motility front both in terms of cell number and cell morphology. Further details of the cell morphology were obtained by confocal laser scanning microscopy. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g005">Figures 5e–h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g003">3D</xref> isometric projections of volume reconstructions from different focal plane micrographs show the morphology of HDF cells in different locations within a range of 100 µm at submicron spatial resolution. Such systematic analysis shows that HDF cells have different morphologies and/or alignments depending on how far they penetrated within the protein gel. Elongated and aligned HDF cells formed very regular, densely-packed multi-cellular structures both within and on the surface of the pre-cast gel between the initial cell seeding and the migration front areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g005">Figure 5e</xref>). On the same area, individual cells were also observed to sprout randomly from the aligned morphology to assume a more dendritic morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g005">Figure 5e</xref>). This dendritic morphology was also observed for cells that were still localized in the initial cell seeding area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g005">Figure 5f</xref>). Here HDF cells are linked by the dendrites to form a random 3D network. These dendrites were imaged at higher magnification and are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g005">Figure 5g</xref>. Cells in this area seem to have very few elongated filipodia. In contrast, cells located at the migration front far from the cell seeding area are less packed and are oriented randomly toward the cell-free zone of the pre-cast fibrin gel, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g005">Figure 5h</xref>. Cells exhibited lamellipodia-like structures with many tiny filopodia-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g005">Figure 5h</xref>). Such structural details are essential to shed light on cell mobility and cell proliferation in 3D, which is much closer to the in vivo scenario. On another level of complexity, 3D fluorescence tracking can be used to assess how different cells co-operate to form complex tissues. Over the last decade, we have developed several three-dimensional tissue-engineered models of human tissue that more accurately reflect the in vivo situation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Chakrabarty1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-MacNeil1">[33]</xref>. Such constructs offer a powerful tool to aid our understanding of how cells behave and co-operate when forming complex tissues. Herein we observe the formation of a human oral mucosa, because we have previously shown that such constructs can be conveniently imaged using confocal laser scanning microscopy by exploiting their intrinsic auto-fluorescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Hearnden1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Hearnden2">[35]</xref>. Tissue-engineered oral mucosa were formed by seeding primary human oral fibroblast (HOF) and human oral keratinocytes (HOK) on de-epithelialised acellular dermis (DED) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Bhargava1">[36]</xref> DED is an excellent scaffold for the formation of human epithelia as these cells have the right characteristics for hosting both stromal fibroblast (i.e. collagen and fibrin) and keratinocytes (i.e. basal membrane proteins). However, although such a complex protein network exhibits auto-fluorescence over quite a wide range, we recently found that this fluorescence becomes negligible in the red (and far red) end of the spectrum (i.e. at excitation wavelengths longer than 540 nm) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Hearnden2">[35]</xref>. We therefore exposed HOF and HOK cells to polymersomes loaded with red Rhodamine B octadecyl ester and far-red (1,1′-Dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine perchlorate) respectively. As shown by the confocal laser scanning micrograph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g006">Figure 6</xref> for both the x-y and x-z planes and also the 3D volumetric reconstructions, the enhanced fluorescence staining allowed tracking of the two different cells over long times. Even ten days after staining, the cells were clearly visible within the DED matrix. In addition, the multicolour imaging allows tracking of the two cell types (white and red) and their localisation respect to the protein matrix (blue). As expected, these cells behaved very differently after seeding. While the keratinocytes began to form typical colonies that gradually transformed into a thick epithelium layer, the fibroblasts started to migrate within the DED matrix and became separated from the keratinocytes. This is clearly visible after 10 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g006">Figure 6c</xref>), with the two cell types now almost completely separated from each other. Such behaviour can be quantified by measuring the z-average penetration over time as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g006">Figure 6d</xref>. The fibroblasts migrate almost continuously during mucosa formation, while keratinocytes prefer to remain on the surface and start organizing into a thick epithelium.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The efficacy of fluorescence imaging of live cells can be substantially improved, both in terms of targeting and temporal staining, by exploiting pH-sensitive polymersomes to ensure effective cytosolic delivery of the fluorophore. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g003">Figure 3c</xref>, HDF cells treated with Rhodamine-loaded polymersomes are considerably more fluorescent than those treated with CellTracker™. In both cases, the dye fluorescence decays with time possibly due to due to secretion and cell proliferation. However, the enhanced delivery of the Rhodamine dye using the polymersomes allows fluorescence to be detected up to 14 days after exposure, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010459-g003">Figure 3d</xref>. Given that the CellTracker dye and Rhodamine B have similar quantum yields and emission efficiencies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Thompson1">[37]</xref>, this enhanced performance must be due to the more effective dye delivery. We have confirmed efficient cellular uptake of polymersomes using 22 different types of animal and human cells, including both primary cells and cell lines. Polymersomes can encapsulate large quantities of hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and/or amphiphilic compounds, exhibit high affinity toward cells without causing cytotoxicity, and, after internalisation, deliver their dye payload within the cell cytosol. The combination of such versatile delivery vehicles with non-toxic fluorophores that target specific cell components has the potential for enormous impact on both cell and molecular biology. Finally, polymersome-mediated staining combined with confocal laser scanning microscopy for the first time has allowed us to study in details cells in complex 3D environments. This discovery clearly opens up promising new research avenues by allowing improved access to the majority of the biochemical processes that make up the complexity of life.</p>

<title>Production of polymersomes</title>
<p>Polymersomes encapsulating amphiphiles/hydrophobic molecules: 1×10–3 moles of PMPC25-PDPA70 copolymer were dissolved in a glass vial in a 2∶1 chloroform: methanol solution. For samples encapsulating rhodamine 0.05×10–3 moles of rhodamine B octadecyl ester perchlorate were added (Sigma) to the co-polymer solution. For polymersomes encapsulating 1,1′-Dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine perchlorate (Sigma) 10 µg of this compound were added to the polymer solution. For polymersomes encapsulating BODIPY TR ceramide 0.05×10–3 moles of phospholipids was added to the polymer solution. For polymersomes encapsulating fluorescein 1,2-dihexadecylphosphatidylethanolamine 0.05×10–3 moles of phospholipids were added to the polymer solution. For polymersomes encapsulating NBD Cholesterol 0.05×10–3 moles of that molecule were added to the polymer solution. Afterwards a copolymer film was formed by evaporating the solvent for 2 hours in a vacuum oven at 37°C. The film was then rehydrated using 2 ml pH 2 PBS (100 mM). Once the film dissolved the pH was gradually increased to 7.3 in order to obtain a 0.05 mM polymer solution. The polymersomes solution was then purified by gel permeation chromatography using a sepharose 4B size exclusion column to extract the fraction containing polymersomes and removing any un-encapsulated. Polymersomes encapsulating hydrophilic molecules: 1×10–3 moles of PMPC25-PDPA70 copolymer were dissolved in a glass vial in a 2∶1 chloroform: methanol solution. Afterward a copolymer film was formed by evaporating the solvent for 2 hours in a vacuum oven at 37°C. The film was then rehydrated using 2 ml pH 2 PBS (100 mM). Once the film dissolved the pH was gradually increased. At pH 6 payloads were added (0.01 mg of propidium iodide, 0.01 mg of quantum dots (Lumidot™ CdSe/ZnS 69346 nanopowder), 0.08 mg/ml of antibodies (mouse monoclonal anti-human-a-tubulin FITC-labelled IgG), 10 ng of RNA. The pH of the resulting solution was risen to 7.3 before sonication for 15 mins using a sonicator (Sonicor Instruments Corporation). The polymersomes solution was then purified by gel permeation chromatography using a sepharose 4B size exclusion column to extract the fraction containing polymersomes and removing any un-encapsulated. In all cases the polymersomes size distribution determined by Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was 200 nm±50 nm.</p>

<title>Cell culture</title>
<p>Primary human dermal fibroblasts: (HDF) were isolated from skin obtained from abdominoplasty or breast reduction operations (according to local ethically approved guidelines, NHS Trust, Sheffield, UK). Primary cultures of fibroblasts were established as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Eves1">[40]</xref>. Briefly, the epidermal layer of the skin was removed by trypsinisation and the remaining dermal layer was washed in PBS. The dermis was then minced using surgical blades and incubated in 0.5% (w/v) collagenase A at 37°C overnight in a humidified CO2 incubator. A cellular pellet was collected from the digest and cultured in DMEM (Sigma, UK) supplemented with 10% (v/v) foetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin and 625 ng/ml amphotericin B. Cells were sub-cultured routinely using 0.02% (w/v) EDTA and used for experimentation between passages 4 and 8. Primary human oral fibroblasts (HOF) and normal human oral keratinocytes (HOK) were isolated from oral mucosal biopsies obtained from consenting patients during dental surgeries. The biopsies were incubated overnight at 4°C in 0.1% w/v Difco trypsin solution supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin and 0.625 µg/ml amphotericin B. The epithelium was then peeled from the connective tissue component and HOKs were gently scraped from the underside of the epithelium and the top side of the connective layer using a scalpel. HOKs were cultured according to the method by Rheinwald and Green. Briefly, cells are cultured on an irradiated mouse fibroblast (i3T3) feeder layer in Green's media. Green's media is composed of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and Hams F12 medium in a 3∶1 (v/v) ratio supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin and 625 ng/ml amphotericin B, 100 nM cholera toxin, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 0.4 µgml-1 hydrocortisone, 0.18 mM adenine, 0.005 mg/ml insulin, 0.005 mg/ml transferrin, 2 mM glutamine and 200 nM triiodothyronine. HOKs were cultured until 80% confluent and the media was replenished every 3–4 days. i3T3 cells were detached using 0.02% EDTA solution before trypsinisation of the HOKs. HOFs were isolated from the connective tissue component of the oral biopsy. The connective tissue was finely minced and incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator overnight in 10 ml of 0.5% collagenase A. The isolated HOFs were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) foetal calf serum (FCS), 100 IU ml-1 penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin and 625 ng/ml amphotericin B. HOKs were used up to passage 3 and HOFs between passage 3 and 8. Human squamous cell carcinoma: (FADU) whrere cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine and 50 U/ml penicillin &amp; streptomycin.

<p>Macrophage and monocytes culture and extractions: Fresh isolated blood was collected into 50 ml Falcon tube containing 3.7% w/v sodium citrate. Blood solution was spun down for 20 minutes at 400 g/1400 rpm. Serum was collected to make platelet rich plasma derived serum (PRPDS). 0.026 ml of CACl2 1 mM was added to every ml of the serum and the solution was incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. Blood cells were then mixed 1∶1 with HBSS (Cambrex/BioWhittaker, Cat no. BE10-547F). Subsequentially 30 ml of blood/HBSS was overlaid onto 20 ml Ficoll-Hypaque Lymphocyte Separation Media (LSM1077 – PAA Labs, Cat no. J15-004). Blood fractions were spun for 40 minutes at the same rpm as before to be separated. At this point the Monocyte layer (approx 50 ml) was collected and dispersed in HBSS media. Then the tube was spun down for 15 minutes, and the supernatant was discarded. Finally the cell number was counted. Cells has been plate at 20×10<sup>6</sup> in a 6-well plate in IMDM (Sigma, Cat no.

MTT-ESTA assay: All cells types were seeded in standard 24 well plates at a density of 3×10<sup>4</sup> cells per well and grown for two days in culture medium. Blood cells (macrophages, monocites and red blood cells) were left and treated in suspension. Cell monolayers/suspension was treated for 24 h with fresh medium containing 0.005 mM of polymersomes. Viable cell density was then assessed using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay. Briefly, treated/untreated cells were washed thoroughly twice with PBS and then incubated in MTT solution (0.5 mg/ml MTT in PBS, 1 ml per well of 24 well plate or per cm2 of cultured tissue) for 45 minutes at 37°C and 95% air/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Intracellular metabolic activity reduces MTT to a purple formazan salt.

<title>Culture of 3D tissue engineered oral mucosa</title>
<p>Skin obtained from consenting donors was de-cellularised in 1 mol/L sodium chloride for at least 8 hours and washed thoroughly in PBS and cell culture medium to create de-epithelialised dermis (DED). When HOFs and HOKs were 70–80% confluent, dye containing polymersomes were added to the cell culture medium giving a final concentration of 1 mg polymer/ml cell culture media. HOFs and HOKs were incubated for 24 hours with Rhodamine B octadecyl ester perchlorate and 1,1'-Dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine perchlorate containing polymersomes respectively. Cells were then trypsinized before being added to the 3D culture as a cell suspension. DED was cut into 2 cm×2 cm squares and placed into 6 well plates submerged in Green's media. 1 mL of cell suspension containing 5×105 polymersome labelled HOKs and 5×10<sup>5</sup> polymersome labelled HOFs in Green's media was added into stainless steel rings pushed onto the DED. Green's media was also added outside the ring to stop the cell solution leaking out. After 2 days half the media inside the ring was changed. On day 3 the DED with cells attached was brought to an air liquid interface using a stainless steel grid and the first image was obtained. The underside of the model was in contact with Green's media while the top was exposed to the air to encourage epithelial stratification.

<title>Cell seeding using fibrin clot</title>
<p>Fibrin clot was used to seed cells at specific areas for some of the 2D and all the 3D culture experiments. Briefly, cell suspension was prepared by mixing fibrinogen (3.5 mg/ml), thrombin (10 units/ml) and HDFs (1×10<sup>5</sup> cells per ml of fibrin fibrinogen) together. Tiny drops (10–20 µm) of the cell suspension were quickly transferred to specific areas of either 2D or 3D culture systems. After incubated at 37°C for 20–40 minutes, the fibrinogen polymerised and the cells were embedded in the fibrin clot. Cell culture was subsequently carried out by submerging the cells and or the 3D scaffolds in DMEM medium. In this research, whether the HDFs were stained (with either vesicles or Cell TrackerTM) or not, the cell densities in all the cell suspensions were constant (1×10<sup>5</sup> cells per ml of fibrin fibrinogen). Slight modification was made to the previously developed 3D cell culture system using fibrin clot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010459-Sun1">[41]</xref>. Briefly, plasminogen-free bovine fibrinogen (3.5 mg/ml) dissolved in serum free DMEM medium was mixed thoroughly with bovine thrombin (10 IU/ml), and then quickly transferred into a silicon mould attached to 6-well tissue culture plate to cast a thin fibrin gel with the thickness of 0.2–0.5 mm. After the fibrin matrix gelled within 20–40 minutes, HDFs were seeded specifically on one end of the pre-cast gel using the cell seeding method described earlier. Cell culture was then carried out by submerging the gel and the cells in DMEM medium at 37°C, 95% air/5% CO2. During cell culture in the 3D fibrin clot scaffold, the media were changed 2–3 times a week. To monitor the performance of the culture systems and or investigate cell-cell cell-scaffold interactions at different culture time points, the 6 well plates were taken out of the incubator and image analysis of the cells was performed from the bottom of the plate using inverted phase-contrast or epifluorescent microscopy as described in the following sections. For confocal laser scanning microscopy, immersion objective lenses were used to monitor the cell cultured in 2D or 3D environments directly.</p>

<title>Microscopy</title>
<p>Both epifluorescence microscopy and Confocal laser scanning microscopy were used to monitor and analyse cells cultured on either tissue culture surface or 3D scaffolds after the cells were stained with CellTracker™ or polymersomes encapsuling Rhodamine B octadecyl ester perchlorate. Epifluorescent or confocal images were taken using ImageXpress™ (AXON, USA), fluorescent microcope (Leica, Germany) with a 10×magnification lens and Confocal Laser Scanning Microcope LSM 510 META (Carl Zeiss, Germany) at λ<sub>ex</sub> = 543 nm, λ<sub>em</sub> = 600 nm (for vesicle rhodamine/Cell TrackerTM visualization) with a 40×magnification lens. In order to locate cells in fibrin clot for optical sectioning of the cells in the scaffold, cell nuclei were also stained with 1 µM of SYTO 9 dye (Invitrogen, UK) for 10–15 minutes and washing thoroughly with either PBS or cell culture media for laser scanning confocal microcopy at λ<sub>ex</sub> = 488 nm, λ<sub>em</sub> = 543 nm. In situ analysis of cell density, integrity and distribution in 2D or 3D culture was conducted using image analysis software (Openlab 4.0.2, Volocity 3.0.2 and LSM510 META). Reconstructed 3D images were also produced using LSM510 META software by taking separated z-stacked image planes through different layers of the tissues, followed by volume reconstruction.</p>
