<title>Background</title>
<p>We previously demonstrated the therapeutic benefits of pentosan polysulfate (PPS) in a rat model of mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type VI. Reduction of inflammation, reduction of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) storage, and improvement in the skeletal phenotype were shown. Herein, we evaluate the long-term safety and therapeutic effects of PPS in a large animal model of a different MPS type, MPS I dogs. We focused on the arterial phenotype since this is one of the most consistent and clinically significant features of the model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
<p>MPS I dogs were treated with daily oral or biweekly subcutaneous (subQ) PPS at a human equivalent dose of 1.6 mg/kg for 17 and 12 months, respectively. Safety parameters were assessed at 6 months and at the end of the study. Following treatment, cytokine and GAG levels were determined in fluids and tissues. Assessments of the aorta and carotid arteries also were performed. No drug-related increases in liver enzymes, coagulation factors, or other adverse effects were observed. Significantly reduced IL-8 and TNF-alpha were found in urine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). GAG reduction was observed in urine and tissues. Increases in the luminal openings and reduction of the intimal media thickening occurred in the carotids and aortas of PPS-treated animals, along with a reduction of storage vacuoles. These results were correlated with a reduction of GAG storage, reduction of clusterin 1 staining, and improved elastin integrity. No significant changes in the spines of the treated animals were observed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>PPS treatment led to reductions of pro-inflammatory cytokines and GAG storage in urine and tissues of MPS I dogs, which were most evident after subQ administration. SubQ administration also led to significant cytokine reductions in the CSF. Both treatment groups exhibited markedly reduced carotid and aortic inflammation, increased vessel integrity, and improved histopathology. We conclude that PPS may be a safe and useful therapy for MPS I, either as an adjunct or as a stand-alone treatment that reduces inflammation and GAG storage.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are group of 11 lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) due to deficiencies of enzymes that degrade glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref002">2</xref>]. MPS type I results from deficient activity of alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA), leading to the accumulation of partially degraded heparan and dermatan sulfate fragments in fluids and tissues. It is a clinically heterogeneous disorder and commonly classified into three subtypes: Hurler (MPS IH), Scheie (MPS IS), and Hurler/Scheie (MPS IH/S). GAG accumulation in all MPS types has a direct effect on connective tissue formation and function, resulting in an array of skeletal, skin and other connective tissue abnormalities, as well as lesions in other organs such as the central nervous system (CNS). In addition, GAG accumulation in this and other MPS types activates the toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref003">3</xref>], initiating chronic inflammation that results in proliferation (e.g., of synovioctyes) and apoptosis (e.g., of chondrocytes) of connective tissue cells, and further exacerbates the disease pathology. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and enzyme replacement therapies (ERT) are available for MPS patients, but neither treatment completely ameliorates GAG accumulation or the progression of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref007">7</xref>]. Residual GAG accumulation is particularly prominent in tissues such as the heart, brain, and the musculoskeletal system, which are less accessible to exogenously delivered enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref009">9</xref>]. Early treatment may partially improve these effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref011">11</xref>], although cardiac valve disease, corneal clouding and skeletal changes still do not respond well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref012">12</xref>]. For example, while ERT may improve some features of the upper airway disease in MPS patients (e.g., narrowed or blocked nasal passages), other elements, such as trachea degeneration, generally do not improve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref013">13</xref>]. ERT also has little or no effect on the CNS. HSCT may similarly slow disease progression in MPS patients provided that the transplant is successful and engraftment of enzyme-expressing donor cells is high, but the effects on the skeletal and neurological systems are limited and the disease continues to progress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref006">6</xref>]. Long-term HSCT outcome studies in MPS IH patients have shown considerable residual disease burden, with high variability between patients. Preservation of cognitive function and a younger age at transplantation were major predictors for superior cognitive development post transplant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref014">14</xref>]. Thus, there is a clear medical need for new MPS therapies that can be used alone or in conjunction with ERT and/or HSCT, which formed the basis of the current study.</p>
<p>Pentosan polysulfate (PPS) is a sulfated polysaccharide polymer isolated from beech trees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref015">15</xref>]. It has potent anti-inflammatory and weak anti-coagulant activity, and has been marketed in Europe for over 30 years with a very positive safety profile. It is also used in veterinary medicine to treat osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref017">17</xref>]. We have previously demonstrated that PPS treatment in MPS VI rats reduced inflammation and resulted in significant pathological and clinical improvements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref019">19</xref>]. We also found that PPS reduced GAG storage in the MPS animals, an unexpected result that was confirmed in urine and tissues. The effects of subQ administration (once weekly) were greater than for daily oral treatment in the MPS VI rat model, particularly in avascular tissues such as the cartilage and bone.</p>
<p>The current study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of PPS in a large animal model of a different MPS type, canine MPS I due to a homozygous null mutation in intron 1 of the <italic>IDUA</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref020">20</xref>]. MPS I dogs are a model with intermediate severity, similar to the Hurler-Scheie phenotype in humans, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref022">22</xref>]. Herein, we compared the two modes of PPS administration in affected MPS I dogs; daily oral treatment for 17 months and bi-weekly subQ treatment for 12 months. Both groups of animals were started on treatment at 3 weeks of age. The main goal of the study was to establish the safety of chronic PPS treatment in a large animal model of MPS prior to the initiation of clinical trials. Several secondary endpoints also were studied, including effects on GAG storage, inflammation markers, and improvement in the arterial phenotype. The latter was chosen as a clinical endpoint due to its consistent presentation in affected animals and the documented influence of inflammation on the cardiac lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref009">9</xref>].</p>

<p>The MPS I canine model has been previously described and used extensively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref023">23</xref>]. The dogs, cross-bred mongrels, were bred and maintained at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine under NIH and USDA guidelines for the care and use of animals in research. The IACUC of the University of Pennsylvania approved all procedures # 804280. Animals had <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food (standard Teklad canine lab chow) and water, housing with enrichment, and a 12 hour light/dark cycle. Housing consisted of expanded mesh flooring, and involved housing with compatible conspecifics as required for social species unless medically or behaviorally contraindicated. MPS I affected animals of both sexes were identified at birth by DNA mutation analysis. Euthanasia by overdose of sodium barbiturate (80mg/kg IV) in accordance with the American Veterinary Association and NIH guidelines. The weight of the animals at the time of euthanasia was between 12 and 26 kg.</p>

<title>Treatment of MPS I Dogs with PPS</title>
<p>Powdered PPS was obtained from bene pharmaChem (Germany) and freshly dissolved in sterile saline before each use. Three week-old MPS I dogs received 1.6 mg/kg of PPS (human equivalent dose, HED) oral every day for 17 months or subQ once every two weeks for 12 months (n = 5/group). Untreated affected littermates were used as controls (n = 5). At 6 months and at the end of treatment (12 and 17 months, respectively) blood was drawn to assess various safety parameters, including general chemistries/K9 panel, K9 CBC, coagulation panel, and liver enzymes. All measurements were performed in the clinical laboratory at the Ryan Veterinary Hospital, University of Pennsylvania, and values were compared to established K9 normal levels. Untreated MPS I dogs of the same age were used as disease controls. Blood was also collected for the quantification of inflammatory cytokines. At the end of the study (i.e., one month after the last PPS dose) the animals were euthanized by overdose of sodium barbiturate (80mg/kg IV) in accordance with the American Veterinary Association and NIH guidelines. Tissues were collected and either frozen or fixed in neutral buffered 10% formalin (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO) for analysis. Urine also was collected for GAG determinations (see below).</p>

<title>Mass Spectometry GAG Analysis</title>
<p>10μl of urine was added to a 96 well omega 10K filter plate (Pall Co, MI) with 90 μl of 50mM Tris HCL (pH 7.0) with a 96-well receiver plate at the bottom. Samples were incubated for 15 min and then centrifuged for 15 min at 2200g. After centrifugation, the 96-well bottom plate was replaced for a new plate and the samples were incubated with a mixture of: 60 μl of 50mM Tris HCL (pH 7.0), 10 μl of 5 μg/ml of internal standard (IS, Chondrosine), 10 μl of 1 mU chondroitinase B (in BSA 1%), 10 μl of 1 mU heparitinase (in BSA 1%), and 10 μl of 1 mU keratanase II (in BSA 1%) (enzymes and IS were provided by Seikagaku Co, Tokyo). Samples were incubated overnight in a 37°C water bath, followed by a centrifugation for 15 min at 2200 rcf and then injected to the LC-MS/MS. The LC-MS/MS was a 1260 Infinity Degasser, 1290 infinity thermostat, 6460 triple quad mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, CA). The method used was based on the method described by Oguma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref023">23</xref>]. Specific precursor ion and <italic>m/z</italic> were used to quantify each disaccharide, respectively (354.3, 193.1 IS; 462, 97 mono-KS; 542, 462 di-KS; 416, 138 ΔDiHS-NS; 378.3, 175.1 ΔDiHS-0S; 458, 175 ΔDiHS-6S; 458.4–300.2 DS).

<title>Histopathology</title>
<p>Descending aortas and left and right carotids were collected from normal, untreated and PPS-treated MPS I dogs. The tissues were either frozen or fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS. The fixed tissues were paraffin-embedded and 6 μm sections were prepared. Slides were stained either with H&amp;E or Van Gieson stain for elastin (Sigma Aldrich, kit# Ht25A). H&amp;E sections were used to quantify the dimensions of the vessels.</p>
<p>For immunohistochemistry, the paraffin-sections were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-X-100, blocked, and incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-clusterin antibody (#05–354, Millipore, Temecula, CA). The Lab Vision Ultravision Detection System (Thermo Scientific, US) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions and mounted with an anti-bleaching mounting media.

<title>Cervical Spine Analyses</title>
<p>Prior to euthanasia, magnetic resonance images (MRI) were obtained of the cervical spine from normal, untreated MPS I dogs, and MPS I dogs treated with oral PPS for 12 months. MRI imaging was not performed on MPS I dogs treated with subQ PPS. MR images were obtained using a 1.5T Signa LX magnet (GE Healthcare; Little Chalfont, United Kingdom). Detailed imaging methods were published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref024">24</xref>]. Disc degenerative condition also was assessed on these animals using the semi-quantitative Pfirrmann grading scheme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref025">25</xref>], where scores range from 1 (healthy disc) to 5 (severely degenerate), and spinal cord compression severity was semi-quantitatively assessed using the scheme of Dickson et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref027">27</xref>]. Disc condition and spinal cord compression severity were calculated for each of 5 cervical spine levels (C2-C7), which were then averaged to produce single mean values for each animal and used for subsequent statistical comparisons.</p>
<p>Following euthanasia, the cervical spine was removed from the animal, the C2 vertebra were isolated, cleaned of surrounding tissue, and scanned using microCT (VivaCT40; Scanco Medical AG, Brüttisellen, Switzerland) by previously published methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref027">27</xref>]. MicroCT was performed on all treated animals, both oral and subQ. Standard 3D morphometric analyses of the trabecular bone were performed using Scanco software to calculate bone volume fraction (BV/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular spacing (Tb.Sp), trabecular number (Tb.N), and apparent mineral density (bone mineral density, BMD). The entire odontoid process was imaged at the same resolution for qualitative morphological examination.</p>
<p>Finally, C2 vertebral bodies were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for one week, then decalcified using formic acid/EDTA (Formical 2000; Decal Chemical Corporation, Tallman, USA). A 3 mm-thick mid-sagittal slab from each sample was isolated and processed for paraffin-embedded histology. Sections 10 μm thick were double-stained with Alcian blue and picrosirius red to demonstrate GAG and collagen, respectively, and then imaged under bright field light microscopy (Eclipse 90i; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The presence or absence of remnant growth plate cartilage in the caudal adjacent to the caudal vertebral end plate was noted.</p>

<title>PPS Reduces Inflammatory Markers in the Serum and CSF of MPS I Dogs</title>
<p>One month after the last PPS administration the treated animals were euthanized and serum, urine, CSF, and tissues were collected. IL-8 and TNF-alpha were measured in the serum and CSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153136.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Significant reductions of both cytokines were observed with both treatment modalities, although greater reductions were obtained from subQ administration, particularly with regard to IL-8 in the CSF. In the serum, PPS was effective in normalizing the levels of TNF-alpha. These results confirmed previous studies in MPS VI rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref019">19</xref>] showing reduction of several serum inflammatory cytokines, and reveal for the first time the potential of PPS to influence CNS manifestations.</p>

<title>Effects of PPS on Vascular Lesions</title>
<p>Vascular lesions are one the most consistent and clinically relevant features of the MPS I dog model. Yano and Lyons et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref009">9</xref>] have detailed the morphology and potential pathological mechanisms contributing to the vascular lesions in the aortas of MPS I dogs, revealing occlusion of the vascular lumen with asymmetrical, atherosclerotic-like plaques resulting in intima-media thickness. Similar findings were observed in the current study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153136.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Compared to these control animals, age-matched, PPS- treated MPS I dogs had significantly thinner intima and wider lumens. High magnification of the intima (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153136.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) showed extensive storage vacuoles in the untreated dogs, and decreased vacuolation in the PPS-treated animals (normal aorta <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153136.s001">S1 Fig</xref>.). This was likely due to a reduction in total GAG storage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153136.g004">Fig 4C</xref>).

<p>It is also known that the plaques and vacuoles forming in MPS I dogs disrupt the internal elastic lamina of the vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref009">9</xref>]. This was similarly observed in the untreated MPS I dogs studied here, where extensive elastin fragmentation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153136.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). PPS-treated aortas showed almost intact elastin fibers without fragmentation in both the oral and subQ PPS-treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153136.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>).</p>

<p>Lyons et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref009">9</xref>] also have demonstrated activation of the NFKB signaling pathway in the MPS I plaques. Khalid et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref028">28</xref>] have found that clusterin (<italic>CLU</italic>, also known as apolipoprotein J) was 9-fold overexpressed in treatment-naive MPS I canine aorta compared to normal canine aorta. The clusterin protein is of particular interest as a potential biomarker of MPS I cardiovascular disease because it is involved in morphologic transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref029">29</xref>] and present in human atherosclerotic plaques, but not in healthy normal aortas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref030">30</xref>]. Therefore, we examined clusterin in both the carotids and aortas of the PPS-treated animals using immunohistochemistry and immunoblots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153136.g006">Fig 6</xref>). The areas surrounding the plaques and the outer edges of the intima showed increased clusterin expression in the untreated vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153136.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), while PPS-treated animals exhibited reduced staining similar to normal. Reduced expression of clusterin following PPS treatment also was confirmed by Western blot analysis, with almost complete normalization observed in the subQ treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153136.g006">Fig 6B</xref>).</p>

<title>Effects of PPS on the Cervical Spine</title>
<p>Intervertebral disc condition, spinal cord compression, and vertebral body trabecular bone properties in the cervical spines of PPS-treated MPS I dogs were examined using MRI, microCT, and histological analyses and compared to age-matched normal and untreated MPS I dogs. No MRI changes or improvements in disc condition or spinal cord compression were noted in the MPS I dogs treated by oral PPS for 17 months (data not shown). Comparative MRI analysis was not performed on the subQ treated dogs. MicroCT analysis revealed modest, but not significant, improvements in BV/TV, BMD, and Tb/Th in the subQ treated animals only (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153136.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Histological analysis revealed some evidence of reduced storage, more evident in the subQ animals, although this could not be quantified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153136.s003">S3 Fig</xref>)</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It is widely recognized that the existing enzyme and stem cell therapies for MPS patients do not completely ameliorate the disease symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref007">7</xref>]. Progressive skeletal, cardiac, neurological, and other disease manifestations continue to progress, even when the therapies are initiated early in life. Our research has therefore focused on understanding the mechanism(s) underlying the skeletal phenotype in MPS, with the long-term goal of developing new therapies that can either be adjuncts to existing treatments or stand-alone therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref020">20</xref>]. An optimal therapy for MPS should be safe, cost effective, easy to administer, and act against a mechanism common to all MPS types.</p>
<p>PPS was originally developed in Germany as an anti-coagulant for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref031">31</xref>]. It has been used in Germany for over 30 years as an injected drug (SP54<sup>®</sup>), and as an oral formulation (Elmiron<sup>®</sup>) in the United States to treat Interstitial Cystitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref033">33</xref>]. Thousands of patients have been treated with PPS and the safety profile is well documented. Although PPS has weak anti-coagulant properties compared to heparin and other more commonly used anti-thrombotic drugs, subsequent research revealed potent anti-inflammatory properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref037">37</xref>]. The anti-inflammatory mechanism of PPS remains unknown, although research has suggested that direct binding of various pro-inflammatory molecules may be responsible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref038">38</xref>].</p>
<p>We have previously documented the important role of the TLR4/TNF-alpha pathway in MPS skeletal pathology, leading us to evaluate PPS in a rat model of MPS VI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref039">39</xref>]. Reduction of inflammation and improvement in skeletal and other clinical features were documented. Weekly subQ administration of PPS led to better effects than daily oral treatment, presumably due to the greater bioavailability of the subQ delivered drug compared to oral (~15% absorption compared to &lt;2%, respectively, <italic>unpublished data from bene pharmaChem</italic>). Of particular surprise was that GAG reduction was observed in tissues of the MPS VI rats, particularly following subQ treatment. The mechanism of how PPS prevents or reduces GAG storage in MPS is currently under investigation, with hypotheses ranging from inhibition of new GAG synthesis, chaperone effects on the mutant enzyme(s), and/or improvement of lysosomal integrity.</p>
<p>Since we have shown that different GAGs activate the TLR4 pathway to a similar degree, we hypothesized that PPS should be effective in other MPS types, leading us to the current study that compared oral vs. subQ PPS treatment in MPS I dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref003">3</xref>]. The canine model of MPS I has been used extensively to develop ERT for MPS I patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref040">40</xref>]. It has a moderate phenotype that most resembles MPS IH/S, with slowly progressing skeletal and neurological features. One of the most consistent and clinically relevant aspects of the model is the arterial phenotype, where affected dogs present with arterial plaque formation, inflammation, and other structural abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref009">9</xref>]. The animals also survive over 2 years, allowing long-term treatment and evaluation. This is important since chronic PPS injections have not been used in any human patient population, including MPS, and the safety needs to be determined. Treatment of the MPS VI rats was performed for up to 6 months without any deleterious effects.</p>
<p>The dose used in this dog study (1.6 mg/kg) was based on previous MPS VI rat studies showing optimal effects at 2 mg/kg, and is within the safe dose range used for SP54<sup>®</sup>. All animal doses were adjusted to human equivalent doses (HEDs) according to standard conversion charts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref041">41</xref>]. Oral administration was performed daily, while subQ was given once every other week. MPS I animals were started on treatment at 3 weeks of age, and the study was designed to evaluate the: a) safety of chronic PPS treatment over time, and b) prevention of the arterial phenotype. Urine and serum cytokine and GAG assays also were performed. The study design called for animals to be treated for at least one year and for monthly blood samples to be drawn to measure various safety parameters, including thrombotic molecules and liver enzymes. Animals receiving oral treatment were extended to 17 months. At the end of the study all of the animals were euthanized along with age-matched, untreated MPS I control dogs, and the tissues and fluids were analyzed.</p>
<p>Most important, no adverse reaction to either PPS treatment was observed, and at no time during the study was any elevation of safety markers observed. As expected from the MPS VI rat results, both PPS treatments prevented the elevation of TNF-alpha and IL-8 in the serum. Of surprise, however, PPS also prevented elevation of these cytokines in the CSF, particularly IL-8. SubQ administration was more effective in the CSF, presumably due to the greater bioavailability. There is little literature examining whether PPS is able to cross the blood brain barrier, however, direct injection of PPS into the CNS of patients with Creutzfeld-Jakob disease resulted in reduction of inflammation and improvement in brain pathology in a small number of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref044">44</xref>]. It is unclear how PPS reduces cytokines in the CSF of MPS I dogs, and the brains of these animals were not collected since untreated MPS I dogs of this age do not develop clinically significant brain disease. However, these results suggest that PPS should be systematically evaluated in other neurological MPS models (e.g., MPS III) in the future to further assess the ability of the drug to influence brain disease, alone or in conjunction with other CNS-directed therapies.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of this study was the effect of PPS on the prevention of GAG storage, confirming the observations described in MPS VI rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref019">19</xref>]. Results were confirmed by analysis of total GAGs and by mass spectrometric analysis of GAG-specific disaccharides. While both heparan- and dermatan sulfate-related disaccharides were reduced by PPS, the effects on the dermatan sulfate fragments were somewhat greater. This is consistent with the clinical effects of PPS in the MPS VI rats, a model in which dermatan sulfate is the major accumulating GAG. In the future it will be important to evaluate PPS in animal models of other MPS types with different patterns of GAG storage to better understand which MPS would be most amenable to PPS treatment.</p>
<p>The other primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of PPS on the arterial phenotype. Both PPS treatments prevented inflammation and plaque formation in the aortas and carotid arteries of the MPS I dogs, although the effects of subQ administration were somewhat greater than oral. This was particularly evident from the immunoblots of clusterin and by GAG analysis, again attributed to the better bioavailability of the subQ drug. Arterial disease is an important feature of MPS that is not particularly well treated by existing ERTs, and this result could have important clinical implications for patients.</p>
<p>This study also assessed changes in the spines of the PPS-treated MPS I dogs. Cervical spinal disease is an important and debilitating feature of MPS, and has been assessed previously in this canine model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153136.ref027">27</xref>]. For example, MicroCT analysis of vertebrae from MPS I dogs at 3, 6 and 12 months of age showed lower trabecular bone volume/total volume (BV/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular number (Tb.N) and bone mineral density (BMD) than normal dogs at all ages. The odontoid process also appeared morphologically abnormal in MPS I dogs at 6 and 12 months of age, and affected animals had significantly more cartilage in the vertebral epiphyses. In addition, the epiphyseal growth plate was absent in 12 month old normal dogs whereas in the MPS I dogs they persisted. In the current study MRI analysis was only carried out on dogs treated with oral PPS due to funding constraints, and did not reveal any drug related improvements. MicroCT analysis was performed on both sets of treated animals and revealed modest improvements in some parameters (BV/TV, BMD, and Tb.Th), but only in the subQ treated animals. Reduced storage also was observed in the vertebral bodies of both treatment groups, more evident in the subQ group. These studies suggest that some modest improvements may be achievable by PPS treatment in MPS spines, although they likely will require subQ administration for at least 2 years.</p>
<p>Overall, we conclude that PPS should continue to be investigated for the treatment of MPS, particularly as a subQ formulation that may be given biweekly or perhaps less frequently. There are several ways to envision PPS use for MPS; either as an adjunct together with ERTs or as a stand-alone therapy. The latter may be particularly amenable in the context of newborn screening to treat MPS children prior to the initiation of ERTs, or used in patients who cannot receive ERT either because it is not available or because of immune responses. Lastly, it is important to note that based on these animal studies two small proof-of-concept clinical trials have recently been concluded in adult MPS I and II patients receiving ERTs (unpublished results). The drug was administered subQ for up to 6 months and no drug-related adverse events were observed. Several positive trends were observed in urine GAG reductions and clinical improvements.</p>
