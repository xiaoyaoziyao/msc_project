<abstract>
<p>Metabarcoding is an emerging genetic tool to rapidly assess biodiversity in ecosystems. It involves high-throughput sequencing of a standard gene from an environmental sample and comparison to a reference database. However, no consensus has emerged regarding laboratory pipelines to screen species diversity and infer species abundances from environmental samples. In particular, the effect of primer bias and the detection limit for specimens with a low biomass has not been systematically examined, when processing samples in bulk. We developed and tested a DNA metabarcoding protocol that utilises the standard cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) barcoding fragment to detect freshwater macroinvertebrate taxa. DNA was extracted in bulk, amplified in a single PCR step, and purified, and the libraries were directly sequenced in two independent MiSeq runs (300-bp paired-end reads). Specifically, we assessed the influence of specimen biomass on sequence read abundance by sequencing 31 specimens of a stonefly species with known haplotypes spanning three orders of magnitude in biomass (experiment I). Then, we tested the recovery of 52 different freshwater invertebrate taxa of similar biomass using the same standard barcoding primers (experiment II). Each experiment was replicated ten times to maximise statistical power. The results of both experiments were consistent across replicates. We found a distinct positive correlation between species biomass and resulting numbers of MiSeq reads. Furthermore, we reliably recovered 83% of the 52 taxa used to test primer bias. However, sequence abundance varied by four orders of magnitudes between taxa despite the use of similar amounts of biomass. Our metabarcoding approach yielded reliable results for high-throughput assessments. However, the results indicated that primer efficiency is highly species-specific, which would prevent straightforward assessments of species abundance and biomass in a sample. Thus, PCR-based metabarcoding assessments of biodiversity should rely on presence-absence metrics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A minor proportion of all species on Earth are known [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. At the same time, anthropogenic impacts have initiated a mass extinction of species in the “Anthropocene” [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], with pervasive and often negative consequences for ecosystem functioning and human well-being [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. To counteract biodiversity loss, fast and reliable tools are needed to assess and monitor biodiversity [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Stream biodiversity is particularity affected by anthropogenic degradation [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, large-scale monitoring and management programs have been established, for example, the European Union Water Framework Directive and the US Clean Water Act. In these biomonitoring programs, species lists, particularly of benthic invertebrate indicator species, are the central metric to assess the ecological status of freshwater ecosystems. For stream assessments, hundreds of benthic organisms are sampled in a standardised fashion, sorted, identified, and used in standardised analytical work flows (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). However, many benthic invertebrate larvae are difficult to identify at the species level, and thus the most practical taxonomic level for the identification of these organisms is often only the genus or family [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This is a major concern, as different species within a genus or subfamily can have different ecological preferences and stress tolerances and belong to different functional feeding groups [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] see [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] for review. Even worse, frequent identification errors occur and many specimens are not detected in samples [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; these limitations have direct consequences for the inferred ecosystem assessment metrics [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and thus management decisions.</p>
<p>DNA barcoding allows for standardized and accurate species identification [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. As this method is DNA based, it can be used to identify species reliably even when juvenile instars or fragments of organisms are available. For animals, a 658-bp standardized fragment of the mitochondrial gene COI (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1) is typically used [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. DNA barcoding requires the establishment of an accurate reference database. For macroinvertebrates, this is best achieved by determining diagnostic characters (usually in male adult specimens [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]), sequencing the specimens, and depositing the COI sequences in a database such as the BOLD database [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In times of declining taxonomic expertise [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], these curated and public barcode databases are indispensible to conserve taxonomic knowledge.</p>
<p>COI barcoding methods are well established for freshwater organisms [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and initial studies have tested their potential for freshwater ecosystem assessments using classical Sanger-based sequencing [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Stein and co-authors showed that ten of 16 assessment metrics had higher statistical power using DNA barcoding than morphological assessment [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, Sanger sequencing requires that each specimen is processed individually in the laboratory, which is costly and extremely time-consuming for routine community assessments involving hundreds or thousands of specimens per sample.</p>
<p>This challenge can be overcome with the aid of next-generation sequencing, which enables the simultaneous analysis of millions of sequences. One next-generation sequencing technique termed <italic>metabarcoding</italic> (also called <italic>community barcoding</italic>) utilises the same principle as classical barcoding, yet with much higher throughput, allowing the simultaneous processing of hundreds of samples in a single analysis. When complete specimens are identified in bulk, it was suggested to use the term <italic>DNA metabarcoding</italic> to make a distinction to approaches using environmental DNA (eDNA) [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, as our findings largely apply to eDNA-based methods as well, we here refer to metabarcoding in a broad sense. Metabarcoding is currently being tested to address a wide range of biological problems, such as invasive species detection [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], gut content analysis [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and assessment of microbial [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and metazoan diversity, such as that of arthropods (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]). Initial studies on benthic diatoms [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and macroinvertebrates [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] show the potential of this method to revolutionise the way we monitor stream ecosystems. However, there are general challenges associated with the use of metabarcoding for ecosystem assessments. While preliminary bioinformatic pipelines for data analysis are available (e.g., Mothur [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], QIIME [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], UPARSE pipeline [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]), barcode reference databases are still incomplete. There are furthermore two problems of central importance that have not been addressed systematically. First, sampled organisms have vastly different biomasses, and thus small organisms may be lost owing to low number of sequence reads [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Second, the amplification efficiency of the COI gene varies among species, and this might severely bias results [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] particularly in view of the variation in biomass. Precise estimates of biomass with respect to specimen recovery and primer bias have not been performed.</p>
<p>We describe an innovative and efficient strategy to analyse macroinvertebrate samples on an Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform. High sequence similarity in in amplicon sequencing can lead to decreased sequence quality on Illumina platforms [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We deal with this issue by using uniquely tagged fusion primers targeting the standard barcoding region, which are simultaneously sequenced in forward and reverse sequencing direction to increase nucleotide diversity and thus improve read quality. With the new protocol, we performed two controlled experiments to address the two problems outlined above. First, we assessed the relationship between biomass and sequence abundance by sequencing genetically distinct specimens that differ widely in biomass, but belong to a single species. This allowed us to determine whether and when small specimens are lost owing to low read coverage. Second, we used equal amounts of tissue from 52 freshwater taxa to determine how well they are recovered given species-specific PCR amplification bias when extracting many species in bulk. All analyses were performed with ten replicates to improve statistical robustness.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Two experiments were performed (<xref rid="pone.0130324.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). In experiment I, the influence of biomass on sequence abundance and the reproducibility of the method were tested using 31 stonefly specimens of the same species (<italic>Dinocras cephalotes</italic>), i.e., standardizing for a single species. In experiment II, species detection rates were tested using the standard barcoding primers LCO1490 and HCO2198 [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and controlling for tissue biomass.</p>

No further permissions were required for sampling all other non-protected species from the Felderbach (N51.3450, E7.1703) and Ruhr University Bochum pond (N51.4457, E7.2656).</p>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Primer design and sequencing strategy</title>
<p>Fusion primers were designed that combined the standard COI LCO1490 (LCO) and HCO2198 (HCO) [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] with Illumina sequencing tags (<xref rid="pone.0130324.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). The advantage of fusion primers is that the COI barcoding fragments can be loaded directly onto the MiSeq sequencer after a single PCR and a purification step. COI amplicons are typically similar in base composition; therefore, three strategies were used to increase sequence diversity. First, 20% PhiX control was spiked into both MiSeq sequencing libraries. The PhiX library consists of fragments of a whole viral genome, which has a high nucleotide diversity. Second, the bases before the start of the Folmer primers were shifted by 0–4 bp increasing nucleotide diversity of amplicons at each read position (as described in [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]). Finally, a new approach was developed to increase diversity by simultaneously sequencing both LCO and HCO primers. A much higher per-site nucleotide diversity was observed using the consensus sequences of the 31 unique <italic>Dinocras cephalotes</italic> COI haplotypes (see <xref rid="sec004" ref-type="sec">experiment I</xref> below) (<xref rid="pone.0130324.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). Fewer peaks of low diversity (only up to 70% identical bases) were detected using both primers than using one primer at a time (100% identical bases). The parallel sequencing approach thus substantially reduced regions of low per-site diversity, improving read quality.</p>
<p>The adopted strategy of sequencing with LCO and HCO primers simultaneously as well as the 4-bp shifting strategy were used to differentially tag each of the ten replicates of both sequencing runs, allowing the removal of the Illumina tag in the adapters and the omission of the tag-reading step in the MiSeq runs.</p>

<title>Samples and DNA extraction</title>
<p><italic>D</italic>. <italic>cephalotes</italic> larvae with known COI haplotypes were available from a previous study [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. All specimens were stored in 96% ethanol at -20°C. From the specimens, 31 samples with different biomasses that differed by at least 2 bp in the COI barcode from all other specimens were selected (for GenBank accession numbers see <xref rid="pone.0130324.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). All specimens were photographed and one leg was removed as a backup. All specimens were dried overnight at room temperature, weighed with a Sartorius RC 210D scale (0.01 mg accuracy) by two scientists independently and mean values were used for subsequent analyses. For bulk DNA extraction, the 31 specimens (with a cumulative weight of 642.72 mg) were placed in a ceramic mortar and manually ground into a fine powder (20 min processing time) using liquid nitrogen (<xref rid="pone.0130324.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). One-fifth of the ground tissue was divided among 14 reaction tubes at ~9 mg each (9/642.72 = 1.4% of total tissue). DNA was extracted from the 14 aliquots using a modified salt extraction protocol [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Extraction success was checked on an agarose gel. Then, 25 μL of DNA from each aliquot was treated with 0.55 μL of RNase (concentration 10 mg/mL, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at 37°C for 30 min and cleaned up using the MinElute Reaction Clean up Kit to remove RNA (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The DNA concentration after cleanup was quantified using a Qubit 2.0 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with the Broad-Range (BR) Assay Kit.</p>

<sec id="sec006">
<title>COI amplification and sequencing</title>
<p>Four randomly chosen DNA aliquots (1.4% of total tissue) were selected for COI amplification. In addition, 50 ng DNA from each of the 14 DNA aliquots was pooled to create a sample representing 20% of the total tissue. For each of these five samples, two PCR were run using one N5LCO and one N5HCO fusion primer, each uniquely tagged (<xref rid="pone.0130324.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). The same PCR master mix was used for all reactions to ensure identical PCR conditions for all replicates. The ten PCR replicates were then run simultaneously in a C100 Thermalcycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA).</p>
<p>The COI fragment was amplified in a PCR reaction consisting of 1× PCR buffer (including 2.5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>), 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.5 μM of each primer, 0.025 U/μL of HotMaster Taq (5Prime, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), 50 ng DNA, and HPLC H<sub>2</sub>O to a total volume of 50 μL. The PCR program was as follows: 94°C for 180 s, 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 46°C for 30 s, and 65°C for 150 s, and 65°C for 5 min. PCR products were excised from a 1% TAE agarose gel and purified using the MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Concentrations were measured using the Qubit 2.0 BR Kit and the library for sequencing was prepared by pooling 12.3 ng of all ten amplicons. Then, paired-end sequencing was carried out by GATC Biotech (Constance, Germany) using the MiSeq with 300 bp paired-end sequencing.</p>

Sequences with a Phred score of &gt;20 were demultiplexed using the base shift tags in both read directions using an R script (available on request). Primers were removed with cutadapt 1.4.2 [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and forward and reverse reads were concatenated to 540-bp fragments. Paired end sequencing generated 2*300 bp long fragments, which is not enough to recover the complete Folmer COI region, which is typically 658 bp in length. Furthermore, up to 30 bp of the reads are primer sequences, leading to 2*270 = 540 bp concatenated fragments. Sequences of each replicate were compared against a reference database using the blastn algorithm (blastn 2.2.29, [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]). Statistics and data subsetting were performed in R 3.1.2 [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Hits shorter than 500 bp and those that matched two haplotypes equally well owing to sequencing errors and chimeras were removed from the hit table. To ensure reliable hits, only sequences that had a maximum of five mismatches and gaps were included in the analysis. The number of hits per haplotype was calculated and compared to the weight of the corresponding specimens.</p>

<title>Experiment II: Recovery of 52 different taxa</title>

<title>Samples and DNA extraction</title>
<p>Freshwater macroinvertebrates were collected from various streams (and <italic>Daphnia</italic> from ponds) in western Germany and stored in 96% ethanol. Specimens were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible based on morphology. Ten sets consisting of 52 unique taxa were photographed, and roughly equal amounts of tissue were dried overnight and weighed (<xref rid="pone.0130324.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0130324.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). For <italic>Isoperla</italic>, Limoniidae, Tipulidae, and <italic>Cordulegaster boltonii</italic>, fewer than ten specimens were obtained; therefore, tissue from a single specimen was used in more than one replicate extraction. As each distinct morphotaxon was present only once in each of the ten replicates, barcoding prior to DNA extraction was not necessary. The 52 tissue samples per replicate were pooled for DNA extraction, and five replicates were ground in liquid nitrogen for 20 min, while the other five replicates were ground with a Qiagen TissueLyser LT (two times for 2 min at 50 Hz with a short centrifugation of the tubes in between). DNA was then extracted with the salt extraction protocol described in experiment I, and 10 μL of DNA for each of the 14 extraction tubes was pooled for each of the ten replicates. RNA was digested prior to PCR as described in experiment I.</p>

Chimeras were removed from the OTUs using uchime_denovo. The remaining OTUs were identified using the BOLD barcoding database by querying against all barcode records. The ten replicates were dereplicated using derep_fulllength, but singletons were included in the data set. Sequences were matched against the OTUs with a minimum match of 97% using usearch_global.

<title>Sequencing success and statistics</title>
<p>The MiSeq runs of experiments I and II yielded 9.63 and 14.07 Gb of read data, respectively. Both MiSeq runs showed good read quality (sequences with Q30 ≥ 85.3% and 83.3%). The complete MiSeq data from both runs are available online on NCBI with the accession numbers SRS731403 (experiment I) and SRS733820 (experiment II).</p>
<p>Sequences starting with the LCO primer for the first read were significantly overrepresented in experiment I (34% more frequent than sequences beginning with the HCO primer, <italic>t</italic>-test, p = 0.006, <xref rid="pone.0130324.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4A Fig</xref>). In experiment II, we did not detect primer bias (<italic>t</italic>-test, p = 0.41, <xref rid="pone.0130324.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4B Fig</xref>). However, each of the ten replicates had a unique tissue set, in contrast to experiment I, which used the same DNA pool derived from a single species (31 specimens) for all five aliquots.</p>
<p>When normalising the loss of sequences in each data processing step of experiments I and II, we found significant differences between the LCO and HCO primers with respect to the number of reads with no hits in experiment I (<italic>t</italic>-test, p = 0.01, <xref rid="pone.0130324.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Fig</xref>) and final hits in experiment II (<italic>t</italic>-test, p = 0.01, <xref rid="pone.0130324.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B Fig</xref>). The primers (LCO and HCO) had small effects on final sequence abundance, with differences of 2.7% and 4.4% for experiment I and II. We observed a similarly small effect on sequences abundance for the individual specimens in experiment I; there were significant differences in sequence abundance between LCO and HCO for 17 of the 31 stonefly specimens (<italic>t</italic>-test, p&lt;0.05, <xref rid="pone.0130324.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>Sequence abundances for the 52 morphologically identified taxa is shown in rows and the ten replicates used in the experiment in columns. Sequence abundance was normalised across the ten replicates and the amount of tissue used in each extraction. Sequence abundance of each specimens (morphotaxon) of the ten replicates is visualised by different shades of blue. If a field is i.e. half filled (50%) with the mid blue shade (= 1% of total sequences), the respective specimen represented 0.5% (50% of 1%) of the total sequences in that replicate. When no sequences or only a few sequences (below 0.003% of total abundance per replicate) were found for a specimen, it was scored as "No Hit," as indicated by an orange asterisk. On the right, K2P-corrected neighbour-joining (NJ) trees for each taxon, based on the most abundant sequence obtained for each specimen (calculated with MEGA6.06), are shown. MOTUs are defined by a 2% sequence difference based on the NJ tree.</p>

<title>Higher taxonomic resolution</title>
<p>We were able to reliably assign OTUs to all 52 taxa included in the extraction.

This was expected, as morphotaxa could often only be identified at family or order level, and several species per morphotaxon may occur in the sampled aquatic habitats even at the same habitat patch. However, most morphotaxa represented a single MOTU (i.e. distinct biological species). Identification by COI barcode did not perform worse than identification by morphology. In fact, in 50% of the cases, barcoding identified specimens at a finer taxonomic level, and 11 morphotaxa included multiple species using COI data from the BOLD database (<xref rid="pone.0130324.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9A Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Several studies show that DNA-based assessments are superior to morphological assessments in freshwater ecosystems (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]); yet, reliable and standardised laboratory protocols need to be established prior to integrating metabarcoding assessments into existing monitoring programs. Here, we developed a new laboratory workflow and generated highly replicated next-generation sequencing data using the traditional 658-bp Folmer fragment. We used this data to systematically test, for the first time, for a relationship between specimen biomass and sequence reads in a standardised single-species setting (experiment I), and then assessed the impact of primer bias for multi-species samples using standardised biomass pools (experiment II).</p>
<sec id="sec023">
<title>Experiment I: Relationship between specimen biomass and sequence abundance</title>
<p>Benthic indicator organisms vary in biomass, and this variation depends on taxonomic group and life stage. Therefore, it is crucial to determine the relationship between biomass and sequence abundance to i) estimate taxon biomass in samples from read data, and ii) identify critical detection limits for a given sequence coverage and sample size. Piñol et al. [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] proposed a relationship between biomass and sequence reads, but did not systematically examine this hypothesis. Using 31 specimens of a single stonefly species (see [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]) that differed in biomass, we demonstrated a highly significant correlation between sequence abundance and specimen biomass. Irrespective of the tissue volume used for extraction, we recovered all 31 specimens. Weak outliers might be caused by differences in tissue conservation or mismatches in the primer binding sites of individual specimens [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Variation in sequence abundance for each specimen was slightly higher among replicates that had less tissue as starting material. This trend was stronger for specimens with a smaller biomass. This result is expected because stochastic effects increase with reduced specimen biomass. However, our results indicate that the amount of tissue used in the DNA extraction was sufficient and did not lead to the systematic exclusion of small specimens as long as tissues are well ground and specimens have similar amplification efficiencies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the LCO and HCO PCR replicates for DNA extraction yielded highly concordant results, emphasising the overall reliability of our protocol. We detected a slightly different sequencing efficiency between forward and reverse primers, but this only affected total sequence abundance and did not systematically alter the inferences from the data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec024">
<title>Experiment II: Primer amplification bias between species</title>
<p>Amplification of diverse multitemplate mixtures using universal primers can lead to highly unequal amplification efficiencies among products [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. It has therefore been suggested that several group-specific primers are necessary for species monitoring [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Here, we quantified the effect of primer bias using similar tissue biomass and different species (using ten replicates) to determine whether reliable species detection is possible.</p>
<p>The number of sequences per replicate was not biased by primer type (LCO or HCO), indicating that sequencing direction has a negligible effect when independent replicates are sequenced. Furthermore, we recovered a majority of specimens (83%) using one universal primer pair. However, using the Folmer primers, the number of sequences obtained varied among taxa by several orders of magnitude, probably because there were mismatches in the primer binding regions.</p>
<p>While amplification efficiencies were consistent among replicates of a morphotaxon, in particular when determined to species or genus level, some taxa that could only be determined at higher taxonomic level, contained different MOTUs with different amplification efficiencies (e.g. the order Arhynchobdellida). Presumably, these morphotaxa contained several taxonomically distant species, which are unequally well amplified with the Folmer primers. This is consistent with the primer bias which we already observed between morphotaxa and support the overall findings of strong taxon-specific amplification bias.</p>

<sec id="sec025">
<title>Implications for large-scale monitoring and future challenges</title>
<p>In this study, we established a quick and reliable protocol to assess the macrozoobenthic communities of stream ecosystems. We used a highly replicated and standardised approach for species detection using DNA metabarcoding and show that several technical and logistic problems have to be overcome before this protocol can be used for large-scale monitoring.</p>
<p>The results of experiment I show that it is possible to reliably estimate the biomass of a single species, but not its abundance because many small organisms generate the same number of sequence reads as a few large organisms. However, the results of experiment II show that primer efficiencies across different taxa greatly hinder species abundance assessments using PCR-based approaches, which is consistent with the findings of Piñol et al. [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Thus, it is not possible to accurately estimate species biomass or even abundance in diverse environmental samples using amplification-based sequencing protocols. For accurate estimates of biomass, or even rough estimates, a PCR-free approach is needed; however, this requires further development [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Currently, the monitoring of freshwater ecosystems is based on abundance metrics, which cannot be generated using the metabarcoding solutions currently available. Thus, for now, monitoring indices should use genetic data for presence-absence assessments. Initial studies on marine benthic taxa show that presence-absence data is sufficient for precise assessment indices [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], especially considering the additional information gained by species-level identification. Thus, the availability of such highly reliable data on the presence of species (even cryptic) can be very important for community descriptions. Furthermore, we used a universal COI primer with a broad target range [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and only 17% of taxa went undetected. While this is already better than the error rates of several morphology-based studies (see [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] for a discussion), higher detection rates are desirable. This could be achieved if several group-specific primers or even more degenerate primers are used [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Our protocol uses ten tagged fusion primers, and the Folmer primers can easily be supplemented with group-specific primers. To ensure that small specimens are detected, samples can additionally be fractionated into various size categories; extractions can be performed independently for each category, and template DNA amounts can be adjusted according to specimen size prior to amplification and sequencing.</p>
<p>The methods developed in this study can easily be adapted to assess the communities of other ecosystems. Our parallel sequencing strategy leads to an increase in per-site sequence diversity and read quality. The approach can be easily integrated into any other protocol for the MiSeq, HiSeq, or NextSeq protocols. While the use of full COI barcodes targeting the classical primer regions might give the highest taxonomic resolution, mini barcodes might be sufficient to detect most species and are popular in environmental DNA barcoding [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. However degraded DNA and contamination as in eDNA studies with amplicons is not a concern for organisms collected directly from streams. An approximately 400-bp barcode lying within the standard Folmer region would be optimal for both strategies, and plenty of sequence information is available to develop group-specific primers [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The use of a single universal primer pair that amplifies conserved ribosomal mitochondrial gene regions (e.g., 16S and 12S) could be effective [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. However, while this approach could have comparable taxonomic resolution as the COI barcode, it is currently limited by the lack of reference databases [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p>
<p>All assessment protocols rely on reference catalogues against which inventory data of a species from an ecosystem are compared. In particular, changes in species traits in a community (e.g. functional feeding groups, tolerance against pollution) are used as indicator values to evaluate the biological significance of inferred community changes. The efforts of large national and international barcoding consortia (BOLD, iBOL, and GBOL) have contributed to a substantial increase in both the size and quality of reference databases [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], which has provided a basis for species-level assessments. The protocol developed in this study enables the identification of nearly all macrozoobenthic species in an environmental sample. However, DNA-based assessments cannot assign biological traits to species. Therefore, to take full advantage of metabarcoding, acquiring ecological trait data at the species or even population level is the next crucial step. A combination of both data types, i.e., DNA species barcodes and ecological traits, will maximise the power of metabarcoding for the reliable assessment of ecosystem responses under stress and for biomonitoring.</p>
<p>Although more technical developments are necessary, we are confident that metabarcoding will widely replace present biomonitoring methods over time because 1) it has a higher taxonomic resolution [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], 2) it is cost efficient and fast and, most importantly, 3) it reduces human bias enabling comparisons among studies [<xref rid="pone.0130324.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Using our protocol, it is possible to assess community compositions within a week, from sampling to species identification.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We provide a highly reproducible laboratory protocol for processing macroinvertebrate samples in bulk and identified species using metabarcoding with the standard COI region. The technical accuracy of this method was supported by comparisons among many replicates. However, we also showed that the taxon abundance of diverse environmental samples can not be reliably assessed. Therefore, we suggest focusing on reliable presence-absence data obtained from replicated analyses. We are confident that the here presented protocol could be a useful resource to monitor a wide range of ecosystems in the next years.</p>
