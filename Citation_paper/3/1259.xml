<abstract>
<p>Understanding the detailed circuitry of functioning neuronal networks is one of the major goals of neuroscience. Recent improvements in neuronal recording techniques have made it possible to record the spiking activity from hundreds of neurons simultaneously with sub-millisecond temporal resolution. Here we used a 512-channel multielectrode array system to record the activity from hundreds of neurons in organotypic cultures of cortico-hippocampal brain slices from mice. To probe the network structure, we employed a wavelet transform of the cross-correlogram to categorize the functional connectivity in different frequency ranges. With this method we directly compare, for the first time, in any preparation, the neuronal network structures of cortex and hippocampus, on the scale of hundreds of neurons, with sub-millisecond time resolution. Among the three frequency ranges that we investigated, the lower two frequency ranges (gamma (30–80 Hz) and beta (12–30 Hz) range) showed similar network structure between cortex and hippocampus, but there were many significant differences between these structures in the high frequency range (100–1000 Hz). The high frequency networks in cortex showed short tailed degree-distributions, shorter decay length of connectivity density, smaller clustering coefficients, and positive assortativity. Our results suggest that our method can characterize frequency dependent differences of network architecture from different brain regions. Crucially, because these differences between brain regions require millisecond temporal scales to be observed and characterized, these results underscore the importance of high temporal resolution recordings for the understanding of functional networks in neuronal systems.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Understanding the detailed circuitry of neuronal networks is one of the major goals of neuroscience. Emergent properties at the systems level only come through the coordinated activity of large numbers of inter-connected neurons. Therefore, one must understand connectivity among neurons. However, the term ‘connectivity’ has several meanings. For example, there is a distinction between anatomical connectivity and functional connectivity. Anatomical connectivity describes whether or not neurons are physically (synaptically) connected; functional connectivity describes whether or not neurons have correlated activity. Even if neurons are anatomically connected with each other, if they don’t fire together, they will not have functional connectivity. Even if neurons do not share synapses, they could still be functionally connected if they receive common modulatory input. As a final distinction, the term ‘effective connectivity’ is also used to differentiate mere correlation from directed causal influence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Friston1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Feldt1">[2]</xref>, but we will not distinguish these two terms and will instead refer to them both as functional connectivity.</p>
<p>The analysis of network connectivity (network science) has been successfully applied to networks of macroscopic brain regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Lynall1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Sporns1">[5]</xref>. Studies of functional networks composed of individual neurons (referred to as “microscopic” networks) have been limited until recently by recording technology. Optical recording methods, such as calcium imaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Smetters1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Stosiek1">[7]</xref>, and electrophysiological methods, such as large-scale multielectrode-array technology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Litke1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Eytan1">[11]</xref>, have made it possible to simultaneously record the spiking activity from hundreds of neurons, a number sufficient for the application of graph-theoretic approaches.</p>
<p>There have been a few graph-theoretic studies of functional networks among hundreds of neurons using calcium imaging as reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Feldt1">[2]</xref>. Based on these works, the network structure seems to be scale-free in the hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Bonifazi1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Li1">[13]</xref>, or at least has small-world attributes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Takahashi1">[14]</xref>. However, these studies were conducted at relatively low temporal resolution (∼50 ms) and thus the fine temporal structure of the correlations (∼1 ms) has not yet been investigated. Importantly, there are many studies that suggest that brain networks may utilize rhythms at different frequencies, in addition to the millisecond scale for synaptic communication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Buzski1">[15]</xref>. For example, the gamma rhythm seems to play an important role in perception and visual processing in cat cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Engel1">[16]</xref> and the beta rhythm appears to play a significant role in visuomotor integration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Roelfsema1">[17]</xref>. Interestingly, the physiological mechanisms for generating gamma rhythms and beta rhythms exist independently in hippocampal CA1 circuitry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Kopell1">[18]</xref>. Another study suggests that fast gamma (∼90 Hz) and slow gamma (∼40 Hz) rhythms in the hippocampal CA1 region segregate the input source by frequency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Colgin1">[19]</xref>. These synchronies in multiple frequency bands were summarized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Varela1">[20]</xref>. Neural recording with submillisecond temporal resolution could therefore provide a detailed comparison of functional network structure across different temporal scales or (equivalently) frequency ranges.</p>
<p>To investigate functional connectivity across a wide range of temporal scales, we used a 512-channel multielectrode array system developed at the University of California, Santa Cruz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Litke1">[8]</xref>. This system provides 60 µm spatial resolution (60 µm electrode spacing), and 50 µs temporal resolution (20 kHz sampling rate). This temporal resolution is three orders of magnitude finer than the ∼50 ms resolution typically achieved with calcium imaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Sasaki1">[21]</xref>. In addition, the system records the spiking activity of hundreds of individual neurons simultaneously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Tang1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Friedman1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here we propose a novel method for analyzing functional connectivity between neurons at different frequency ranges. In this method, we analyzed cross-correlograms of spiking activity between neuron pairs using a wavelet transform. The wavelet transform revealed the different temporal structures in cross-correlations, which allowed us to directly compare the functional network structures of hundreds of neurons in organotypic cultures of cortex and hippocampus.</p>

<title>Organotypic Culture Preparation</title>
<p>Organotypic cultures were prepared as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Tang1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Friedman1">[23]</xref>. Briefly, brains from postnatal day 6 (P6)-P7 Black 6 mouse pups of either sex were removed under a sterile hood and placed in Gey’s balanced salt solution for 60 minutes at ice cold temperature. After 30 minutes, half the solution was changed. Brains were next blocked into ∼5 mm<sup>3 </sup>sections containing dorsal hippocampus and somatosensory cortex. Blocks were then sliced to a thickness of 400 µm using a vibrating blade microtome (Leica VT1000 S). The angle of the sections was closest to that of a coronal section, but the lateral side of the plane was advanced by 15 degrees in the anterior direction, so that both transverse sections of hippocampus and somatosensory cortex were included in the same tissue. These transverse sections are thought to preserve more of the hippocampal synaptic connectivity within the plane of the slice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Andersen1">[24]</xref>. Each slice was put on a circular piece of filter paper (∼6 mm diameter), and grown in culture medium (50% minimum essential medium, 25% horse serum, 25% Hank’s balanced salt solution, 5 mg/ml D-glucose, 1 mM L-glutamine, 5 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin) in a heated (37°C), CO<sub>2</sub> enriched (5%) incubator for 2–4 weeks.</p>

<title>MEA Electrophysiology and spike-sorting</title>
<p>As mentioned above, all recordings were performed on a custom-made 512-electrode array system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Litke1">[8]</xref>. The flat electrodes were 5 µm in diameter and spaced 60 µm apart in a hexagonal lattice. The recording area was a 0.9 mm by 1.9 mm rectangle. Cultured brain tissues were gently placed on the electrode array using tweezers to hold the filter paper such that the tissue side was facing down and either the cortex or the hippocampus was centered on the array. Typically, the cortex was larger than the size of the array, and the short side (0.9 mm) of the array spanned across 70–80% of the thickness of the cortex. The hippocampus was smaller than the array, covering approximately ∼70% of the active area of the array. A small harp (∼1.3 g) with fine mesh (160 µm pore size) was placed on the filter paper on top of the tissue in order to ensure better contact between the tissue and the array. The tissue was perfused with oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>) culture medium at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. After waiting for 30 minutes to allow the tissue to develop stable spiking activity, extracellular signals were recorded for 60 minutes on each of the 512 electrode channels at a sampling rate of 20 kHz. Raw waveforms were then spike-sorted with a well-established method developed by Litke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Litke1">[8]</xref>, with slight adjustment of the parameters for cortical brain slices. Briefly, signals that crossed a threshold of 8 SDs were marked, and the waveforms found at the marked electrode and its six adjacent neighbors were projected into five dimensional principal component space. A mixture of Gaussians model was fit to the distribution of features based on an expectation maximization algorithm. Duplicate neurons, neurons that had refractory period violations, and neurons with too few spikes (less than 100 spikes/hour) were excluded from further analysis.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry and imaging</title>
<p>After electrophysiological recording, the cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20–30 minutes, then stored in phosphate buffered saline with 0.05% sodium azide at 4°C. Cultures were washed three times with tris-buffered saline (TBS), then immunostained free-floating, ensuring that the tissue side faced upward (filter paper down). Cultures were blocked with 10% normal goat serum and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-X for 2 hours, then washed with TBS and incubated with primary antibody (Neuronal nuclei (NeuN) – Chemicon Millipore (cat #MAB377) mouse monoclonal IgG1 anti-NeuN 1∶1000) overnight at 4°C on an orbital shaker. Cultures were then washed with TBS and incubated with secondary antibody (Molecular Probes Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-mouse IgG 1∶1000) for 2 hours at room temperature on an orbital shaker. Next, cultures were washed with TBS, DAPI stained for 10 min (Invitrogen D21490/DAPI-Fluoro-Pure Grade, 300 nM working solution), and washed again with TBS. Tissues were mounted on superfrost/Plus slides, then coverslipped using Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech) and allowed to dry overnight before imaging. Cultures were imaged on a Leica Spot Scanning SP5 confocal microscope using a 20x/0.5 objective lens; gain and offset were optimized to the z-plane of highest-intensity staining for each culture. Brightfield and fluorescent overlaid images were tiled in order to capture the entire hippocampus and filter paper marks, necessary to orient the placement of the culture on the 512-electrode array.</p>

<title>Identification of hippocampal neurons</title>
<p>Because the slice cultures contained portions of cortex and hippocampus, we sometimes recorded neurons from both brain regions. When slice cultures grow, the distinction between brain regions can often become blurred under bright field microscopy, but the gross structures of cortex and hippocampus are still preserved and can be observed by immunohistology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105324-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In order to identify hippocampal neurons, we compared the photographs of the cultures before and after they were incubated. Photographs of the tissues were taken on the first day in vitro (DIV1) and then 2–4 weeks later (DIV14-28) after recording with the electrode array. The filter paper on which the tissue was placed was marked by two small cuts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105324-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, blue arrows) to allow the positions from the two photographs to be aligned. Aligned photographs suggest that the structures, locations and dimensions of hippocampal cell body layers (dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, and CA1 as labeled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105324-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) were well preserved after more than two weeks of the incubation period. The positions of the neurons were then estimated by fitting two-dimensional Gaussian distributions to the strength of the average signals on the electrodes (electrophysiological images <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Litke1">[8]</xref>). Estimated neuron positions were then plotted on top of the DIV1 photographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105324-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) to compare with the underlying anatomical structures. Only neurons that were within the hippocampal region on the photograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105324-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) were retained for further analysis of the hippocampal network structure. Locations of the identified hippocampal neurons matched well with the cell body layer of the stained hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105324-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). For cortical recordings, we did not categorize neurons because the cortex was large enough to cover the entire array and there were no neurons from other structures present.</p>

<title>Cross-correlation</title>
<p>Several different definitions of cross-correlation have been used in the literature.

The CCH between neuron <italic>I</italic> and neuron <italic>J</italic> is defined by the following equation:<disp-formula id="pone.0105324.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0105324.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>i</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), <italic>j</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) were the binary states of neurons <italic>I</italic> and <italic>J</italic> at time <italic>t</italic>.

<p>When two or more neurons are near the same electrode, their spike waveforms can interfere with each other, and the overlapped spikes are not sorted well. In such a situation, the cross-correlation can have an artifactual trough near the origin. Less frequently, when spikes from a neuron are recorded on multiple electrodes, a small fraction of these spikes can be misidentified as originating from another neuron. This creates a very sharp peak (∼50–100 µs width) in the cross-correlation near τ = 0. To prevent these artifacts from being identified as significant signals, we linearly interpolated a ±1 ms segment from the average cross-correlation from −1.5 to −1.0 ms and from 1.0 to 1.5 ms when the physical distance between neurons was closer than 180 µm (3 interelectrode distances).</p>

<title>Wavelet Transform</title>
<p>The wavelet transform is a widely accepted method for analyzing time series data and is especially useful when there are non-stationary oscillations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Torrence1">[28]</xref>. In neuroscience, wavelets have been used to analyze continuous signals such as local field potentials (LFPs) and electro-encephalogram (EEG) recordings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-LeVanQuyen1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Roux1">[31]</xref>. The wavelet transform has not been widely used as a method to analyze single unit spike trains (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Hulata1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Lee1">[33]</xref>). As far as we know, no one has applied wavelet analysis to cross-correlation functions to assess functional connections, making ours a novel approach. We adopt the mathematical framework and notation used by Torrence and Compo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Torrence1">[28]</xref>. The continuous wavelet transform is calculated by convolving a mother wavelet function with the signal (here, the cross-correlogram). We have chosen a complex Morlet function as the mother wavelet function:<disp-formula id="pone.0105324.e002"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0105324.e002" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>ω<sub>0</sub></italic> is the non-dimensional frequency of the wavelet function, here taken to be 4. An example of the wavelet function is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105324-g002">Figure 2A</xref>. The wavelet transform of the cross-correlogram is given by convolving a scaled, translated and normalized version of this mother wavelet function with the cross-correlogram:</p>

In order to minimize the influence from the edge of the data, we padded both ends of the data with the average of 100 bins at the edge of the CCH such that the total number of bins is a power of 2. Only limited segments of the wavelet transform are used in the following analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0105324-t001">Table 1</xref>), so these edges did not affect our results. The wavelet power spectrum is calculated by taking the absolute square of each point of the wavelet transform.

<title>Examples of cross-correlations and their wavelet transforms.</title>
<p>A–C: Six example cross-correlations and their wavelet transforms from each frequency range. Top of each panel is the cross-correlations of neurons. All these types of structures in the cross-correlation plots are observed both in cortex and hippocampus. The wavelet power spectrum of each pair is shown right below the cross-correlation. Hot colors indicate stronger power and cool colors indicate weaker power. White contours in the power spectrum indicate significance thresholds (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref>). Note the wide variety of shapes that can be observed in each frequency range. A: Examples from high frequency connectivity. Typically, a single peak in cross-correlation was observed. Multiple peaks and oscillatory shapes were observed less frequently. Many connections showed a peak offset from zero (also see D, E). B: Examples from gamma frequency connections. Single peaks and troughs, and oscillatory shapes were the most common. C: Examples from beta frequency connections. Single peaks and troughs, and oscillatory shapes were found. Signs of inhibition on one of the sides also can be found (red arrows). D–G: The distribution of the delay and the frequency of the peaks of wavelet power spectra from cortex (D, F) and hippocampus (E, G) in scale 1 (D, E) and scale 2 (F, G). Examined frequency ranges were bounded by colored dashed lines. The right panel on each plot is the connectivity density at each frequency. Solid green curves indicate 1/4 of the Fourier period of the wavelet function. At this time delay, the primary peak of the wavelet function does not overlap with t = 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105324-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). If the delay is larger than this value, the connection is considered as ‘directed (delayed)’. Broadly tuned clusters of connections were observed in both scale 1 and scale 2 (yellow arrows), which motivated us to set three frequency ranges: high frequency (100–1000 Hz), gamma (30–80 Hz) and beta (12–30 Hz). A peak in the theta band (4–12 Hz) was observed in the cortex (F, blue arrow), but not in hippocampus (G) (see the ‘Cross-correlations and wavelet transforms’ subsection).</p>

<title>Connectivity analysis of the wavelet power spectrum</title>
<p>Once the wavelet power spectrum was calculated, it was subjected to a significance test. The significance test was done by comparing the value of the wavelet power of the data with the value of the wavelet power from a noise distribution. To avoid frequency dependent biases, we chose white noise as our noise distribution, which has a flat power spectrum across all frequencies. Although the analytical form for the wavelet power spectrum is known for a Gaussian white noise time series <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Torrence1">[28]</xref>, the equivalent distribution for Poissonian white noise – the type of noise of our cross-correlations – is not known. Therefore, for this study, the significance threshold was calculated with a Monte-Carlo method by generating white noise cross-correlograms many times. The threshold values were determined as a function of frequency and the number of spikes in the cross-correlogram. Because it is computationally infeasible to generate a threshold for every possible number of spikes, we generated a look up table of threshold values for different numbers of spikes at 10<italic><sup>k</sup></italic>, where <italic>k</italic> = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, … 6.0. We linearly interpolated the results between these numbers. For each unique number of spikes, random white noise cross-correlograms were generated by assigning random timing in the transformed window to each spike, creating Poisson statistics at each bin. These cross-correlograms were generated 10<sup>5</sup> times, and the wavelet power spectrum for each of the correlograms was calculated. Then, the maximum values of the wavelet power spectrum over time were evaluated at each frequency. This produced a distribution of 10<sup>5</sup> maximum values at each frequency. Finally, a <italic>p</italic> = 0.001 threshold was enforced using the 100th highest maximum value at each frequency.</p>
<p>When analyzing the wavelet transforms of the experimental data, peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105324-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, green dot, arrowed) were defined as any point that had a value greater than the 8 surrounding points (all the pixels that surround one pixel in discrete 2-D space) and were detected from the regions of the power spectrum where their value exceeded the threshold. Thus each cross-correlogram could have multiple peaks at different frequencies and times. If the peaks occurred in different frequency ranges, they were treated as different connections. In this manner, functional connections between neurons could be evaluated at any desired frequency band. The directionality of the connection depended on the time offset of the correlogram peaks. If the peak position was more than 1/4 of the full Fourier period away from the center of the cross-correlogram, the connectivity was considered as delayed; otherwise, we considered it non-delayed. The shift of 1/4 of the full Fourier period is where the primary peak of the real part of the wavelet function does not overlap with t = 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105324-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). For example, a simple Gaussian peak is considered as a delayed connection when the time offset of the Gaussian is more than ∼2.2σ, because of the relationship between the Fourier period and the Gaussian width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105324-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, caption). Delayed correlograms were regarded as cases of unidirectional functional connectivity; non-delayed correlograms were considered to be cases of bidirectional connectivity.</p>

<title>Network analysis</title>
<p>The strength of wavelet analysis lies in its ability to categorize neuronal correlation across different frequency ranges. Based on the distribution of the observed wavelet power peaks (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105324-g003">Figure 3</xref> in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref> section), we chose 4 different frequency ranges in our work (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0105324-t002">Table 2</xref>). The first category was high-frequency connectivity (HFC), which we considered to be from 100 Hz to 1000 Hz. In most cases, peaks in correlograms with less than 5 ms width fell into this category. There were a number of neuron pairs that showed cross-correlations that produced HFC (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref>). The second category was gamma-frequency connectivity (GFC), which we considered to be from 30 Hz to 80 Hz. Both hippocampus and cortex are known to produce gamma rhythms in LFPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Lahtinen1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Bouyer1">[39]</xref>. Even though we do not record LFPs, spikes of the neurons can synchronize through them. The third category was beta-frequency connectivity (BFC), which we considered to be from 12 Hz to 30 Hz. This rhythm has also been widely reported in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Bouyer1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Shimono1">[41]</xref>, although the beta oscillations in mouse hippocampus might be limited to in-vitro preparations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Buzski2">[42]</xref>. The fourth category was the theta-frequency connectivity (TFC) (4–12 Hz) – another well-known rhythm in both cortex and hippocampus in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Buzski1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Buzski3">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Kamondi1">[44]</xref>. The results from the TFC largely overlapped with those from BFC, except for the decay length of the connectivity density. We report the results from the theta frequency range in the subsections where we observed differences from BFC.</p>

<p>We assigned the names of these frequency ranges based on common oscillations observed in continuous waveform data such as EEG or LFP recordings. The oscillatory shapes that were observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105324-g003">Figure 3B, C</xref> could be correlated with such oscillatory electric fields. Examples of phase-locking between spikes and fields have been observed in many regions of the brain including cat visual cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Singer1">[38]</xref> and hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Skaggs1">[45]</xref>. However, this does not mean our wavelet peaks in these frequency ranges are always associated with field oscillations. Our analysis found simple peaks and troughs, as well as other non-oscillatory shapes, in both gamma and beta ranges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105324-g003">Figure 3</xref>), which may not be related to gamma and beta rhythms. If we also recorded LFPs, we could potentially study the relationship between the LFPs and the spikes. However, the relationship between the extracellular LFPs and spiking activity is still an active area of study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Buzski4">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Anastassiou1">[47]</xref>. Our primary focus in the present study is to construct and evaluate networks of individual neurons. Thus we did not try to assess the relationship between the constructed networks and the extracellular LFPs.</p>
<p>Previous work has shown that there is a hidden bias that produces potentially misleading results in network measures when the networks have different numbers of nodes (neurons) and edges (connections), as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-VanWijk1">[48]</xref>. In an attempt to mitigate this problem, we randomly subsampled 100 neurons from each tissue, and evaluated each network measure as a function of connectivity density. (Connectivity density is the fraction of connected pairs of neurons among all possible pairs of detected neurons.) In this way, we can compare networks with similar numbers of nodes and edges. We repeated subsampling with 100 different sets of randomly-chosen neurons, and calculated the mean and root mean square of each network measure as a representative value, and its associated error, for that one tissue. The tissues that had less than 100 neurons were excluded from the analysis (18/34 in hippocampus and 2/24 in cortex). Connections were ordered by significance, which was the ratio of the actual power of the peak to the threshold power. Then we evaluated the network properties as a function of the connectivity density from 0.5 to 2.0%.</p>
<p>Once the connections were selected, they were treated as binary connections (connected or not connected). We used connectivity densities up to 2%, although there is previous work that suggests a higher connectivity density (28.8%) is present for adjacent neurons in hippocampal culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Takahashi1">[14]</xref>. There are several reasons why we expect significantly lower connectivity density in our preparations. First, we collected neurons from a large area (0.9 mm×1.9 mm). Therefore, many of the neurons were physically separated by large distances. Indeed, we observed higher connectivity density when the inter-neuron distance was short (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref>). Second, we measured functional connectivity from the cross-correlation of the spikes. Due to reduced statistics, it is possible that we were not able to detect as statistically significant the connections with limited strength. Indeed, sometimes we had tissues that had low connectivity; 13% of the subsampled networks had less than 1% connectivity density; 30% had less than 2%. Even if the subsampled networks had smaller connectivity density than required, we included those networks in the analysis (i.e. the data point for 2% connectivity density includes 30% of networks with connectivity density smaller than 2%. The connectivity density value specified in the figure should be understood as an upper limit of the connectivity density.). When the connectivity density for a given frequency range and data set was less than the specified value, the connectivity densities of the other frequency ranges for the same data set were adjusted to the connectivity density of the frequency range with the lowest connectivity density value in order to avoid a bias due to different connectivity densities in different frequency ranges. We did not simply reject subsampled networks with smaller connectivity density because doing so would cause a bias towards the inclusion of high-degree nodes.</p>
<p>We also measured the connectivity density as a function of distance between the neurons. We measured the distance between a pair of neurons from the estimated locations of the cell bodies (see ‘Identification of Hippocampal Neurons’). We counted the number of pairs as a function of inter-neuron distance in 50 µm bins, and then calculated the probability to observe connected pairs in each bin. Results were averaged over all the cultures, and the mean and the SEM were calculated. We fit the following exponential function with a constant baseline to the resulting probability function:<disp-formula id="pone.0105324.e004"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0105324.e004" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>A</italic>, <italic>λ</italic>, and <italic>C</italic> were fit parameters, and <italic>d</italic> is the physical distance between the neuron pair. Fitting and evaluation of the confidence interval of the fit parameters were performed using the method of least squares in the Matlab Statistics Toolbox.</p>
<p>Once the connections are defined, we measured the network topology of our recorded neurons. “Network topology” refers to the arrangement of the elements – nodes and edges – of a given network. Various network measures were proposed to evaluate network properties as summarized in Box 2 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Bullmore1">[49]</xref>. Among these measures, we chose relatively simple measures that could be easily compared across different frequency ranges and brain regions: the degree distribution, clustering coefficients, efficiency, and assortativity. These measures were evaluated as a function of connectivity density using the Brain Connectivity Toolbox <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Rubinov1">[50]</xref>. Because of the complexity of the comparison across different frequency ranges and brain regions, a thorough analysis of motif structures, module structures, and identification of hubs was beyond the scope of this paper. Here are descriptions of the network measures we used:</p>
<sec id="s2i1">
<title>Degree distribution</title>
<p>The degree distribution of the nodes – the probability distribution of the number of connections per neuron – was calculated from subsampled networks of 100 neurons with a 1% connectivity density, which was in the middle of the range of the connectivity densities we investigated. We will only report our results for output degree, as we achieved the same basic results for the input degree (data not shown). With regard to subsampling, it should be mentioned that scale-free networks are known to not produce a scale-free degree distribution when subsampled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Stumpf2">[51]</xref>. In order to simulate this effect, a subsampled scale-free degree distribution was calculated by subsampling 100 neurons from a 1000 neuron Barabasi-Albert scale-free network produced by preferential attachment at the same 1% connectivity density. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Barabsi1">[52]</xref>. The Barabasi-Albert networks were generated 1000 times and, for each network, the subsampling process was repeated 100 times. We also tried subsampling from 500 neurons and 10000 neurons instead of 1000 neurons; the resulting distributions were the same (data not shown). The degree distribution for the random network was given by the binomial distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Albert1">[53]</xref>, and an exponential probability density distribution was used to create the degree distribution for the exponential network. The parameters for these three networks can be uniquely determined if the number of neurons and the connectivity density are known. The equations and parameters used to generate model degree distributions are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0105324-t003">Table 3</xref>. Also, we measured the number of disconnected nodes (nodes with zero input and output degrees).</p>

<title>Clustering coefficient</title>
<p>The clustering coefficient measures the tendency of connections among network nodes to cluster together locally. If the neighbors of a node (those nodes connected to a given node) are themselves connected together, the clustering coefficient is high. The mathematical definition of the local clustering coefficient is as follows.<disp-formula id="pone.0105324.e007"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0105324.e007" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>N<sub>i</sub></italic> is a subnetwork consisting of neighbors connected to neuron <italic>i</italic> (but does not include neuron <italic>i</italic>) and <italic>k<sub>i</sub></italic> is the number of neurons in subnetwork <italic>N<sub>i</sub></italic>.

</sec><sec id="s2i3">
<title>Efficiency</title>
<p>The efficiency of the network is defined as an average of the inverse of the shortest path length. Here, the path length is defined as the number of edges that must be traversed to go from one neuron to another, not the physical distance between neurons. The average shortest path length is also a widely used measure, but the efficiency, the mean of the reciprocal of the path length, is not divergent in the case of disconnected nodes. (The path length of a disconnected pair is defined as infinity.) While it is true that this problem can be avoided by considering only ‘connected’ parts of the network, this approach would throw away a large number of nodes when the connectivity density is low. This measure is strongly dependent on the connectivity density, and thus it is quite important to compare at the same connectivity density, as we have attempted to do.</p>

<title>Assortativity</title>
<p>Assortativity measures the tendency of nodes to connect to other nodes that have a similar degree. (The degree of a node is its number of connections.) If high degree nodes preferentially connected to other high degree nodes, the assortativity is positive. Many social networks have positive assortativity, and many technological and biological networks have negative assortativity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Newman1">[54]</xref>. Assortativity is defined as the Pearson correlation coefficient of degree for connected nodes.

<title>Electrophysiological properties of the cultures</title>
<p>In total, 59 cortico-hippocampal tissues were used for recordings. 25 tissues were used for cortical recordings; 34 tissues were used for hippocampal recordings. The average number of neurons found in each tissue of cortex and hippocampus was 315±127 and 118±51, respectively. The firing rate distribution is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105324-g004">Figure 4C</xref>. The firing rate for all the neurons in cortex and hippocampus were 10<sup>−0.16±0.64 </sup>Hz and 10<sup>−0.44±0.68 </sup>Hz, respectively. Cortical neurons had a higher average firing rate, and also a larger number of neurons were found in cortical recordings than hippocampal recordings. This smaller number of neurons in hippocampal recordings could be explained by the fact that the hippocampi were not large enough to cover the entire recording array (0.9 mm×1.9 mm); on average the hippocampus covered ∼70% of the array. The tissues that had less than 100 neurons (2 in cortex, 18 in hippocampus) were excluded from further analysis because they had too few neurons for meaningful network analysis. Non-stationary synchronous activity (so-called ‘network bursts’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-VanPelt1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Pasquale1">[56]</xref>) were seen in all the tissues in our recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105324-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). One cortical tissue that showed unusual network bursts that lasted ∼100 seconds was excluded from further analysis. Various types of bursts are summarized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Wagenaar1">[57]</xref>. In summary, 22 cortical recordings and 16 hippocampal recordings were used for further analysis.</p>

<title>Cross-correlations and wavelet transforms</title>
<p>Representative cross-correlations and their wavelet-transforms are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105324-g003">Figure 3A–C</xref>. The example pairs were selected from the significant cross-correlations of both hippocampus and cortex. We measured the delay and the frequency of the peaks of the wavelet power spectra, and determined whether the correlations occur at specific delay or frequency ranges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105324-g003">Figure 3D–G</xref>). Large numbers of directed (delayed) connections were observed in the frequency range above 100 Hz in both cortex and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105324-g003">Figure 3D, E</xref>; connections to the right of the green lines). In the scale with lower frequencies, we could observe peaks in the non-directed (non-delayed) connections at ∼40 Hz and ∼20 Hz both in cortex and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105324-g003">Figure 3F, G</xref>; connections to the left of the green lines; peaks indicated by the yellow arrows). Another peak at ∼9 Hz, which falls in the theta frequency range (8–12 Hz), was observed in cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105324-g003">Figure 3F</xref>; blue arrow), but not hippocampus. It is known that hippocampal theta rhythm is dependent on afferent input <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Buzski3">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Bland1">[58]</xref>. Presumably, the reason why we do not see the prominent theta rhythm of the hippocampus is the lack of afferent input in our organotypic cultures. The observed peak structures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105324-g003">Figure 3D–G</xref> motivated us to separate the frequencies into the 4 ranges (High Frequency, Gamma, Beta and Theta) described in ‘Network analysis’ in the ‘<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref>’ section. We next describe the characteristics of the identified connectivity in each frequency range (except for TFC, which was similar to BFC).</p>
<p>Connections in the HFC (100–1000 Hz) range had very temporally precise cross-correlation. Peaks that had a time offset from zero were the most common in this frequency range (62% directed and 38% non-directed at 1% connectivity density). Troughs and oscillatory shapes were rarely observed in this frequency range.</p>
<p>Connections in the GFC (30–80 Hz) range had relatively more pairs that had zero-centered cross-correlation. Single peaks or single peaks with a little trough on the side were the most common cross-correlations. However, compared to HFC, more troughs and oscillatory shapes were observed. At this frequency range non-directed connections were the most common (24% directed and 76% non-directed at 1% connectivity density).</p>
<p>Connections in the BFC (12–30 Hz) range had even larger temporal structure. The properties of connectivity here were similar to GFC; peaks, troughs, and oscillatory shapes were all observed in this frequency range as well. One notable difference was that sometimes inhibition with relatively long duration from one neuron to another was observed in this frequency range. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105324-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, red arrows) Directed connections were found even less often in this frequency range. (17% directed and 83% non-directed at 1% connectivity density).</p>
<p>As mentioned in the ‘Network analysis’ subsection in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref>, we observe simple peaks and troughs in both the gamma and beta frequency ranges, which may not be related to field oscillations.</p>
<p>Given these three frequency ranges, we can construct three different neural connectivity networks per recording. Example connectivity maps from both cortex and hippocampus are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105324-g005">Figure 5</xref>. This figure illustrates features of different structures in different frequency ranges and in different brain regions. For example, the differences of the degree distribution and shorter connectivity range in high frequency cortex compared to high frequency hippocampus are visible. These observed features are better quantified in the following section.</p>

<p>Connectivity maps of one of the tissues from cortex (A–C) and hippocampus (D–F) at three different frequency ranges: high frequency (A, D), gamma (B, E), and beta (C, F).

The size of a circle indicates the number of functional connections (degree) of the associated neuron with other neurons. Lines with a color gradient from blue to red indicate directed (delayed) connectivity that goes from the blue end to the red end; solid cyan lines indicate non-directed (non-delayed) connectivity. The threshold value for delayed connections was set to 1/4 of the Fourier period of the wavelet function (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Method</xref>). Larger numbers of directed connections were observed in high frequency networks (A, D).

The degree distributions of the model networks (random, exponential, scale-free) were also shown. None of the distributions from the data showed an acceptable match (&gt;5% confidence level) to the model distributions. The closest match was the cortical HFC network to the exponential distribution (χ<sup>2</sup><sub>red</sub> = 2.0, ∼1% confidence level), but the others did not match at all (χ<sup>2</sup><sub>red</sub>&gt;10, &lt;10<sup>−15</sup>% confidence level). The cortical HFC network showed a different degree distribution from that produced by GFC and BFC. It was the only network that had a shorter tail of the degree distribution than that produced by the simulated scale-free network. (Recall that this scale-free network degree distribution does not appear as a straight line because it contains 100 nodes that are subsampled from a 1000 node scale-free network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Stumpf2">[51]</xref>, as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref>.)

<p>Multiple network topology measures showed differences in different frequency ranges and brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105324-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The number of disconnected neurons (out of the subsampled networks of 100 neurons) was smaller for HFC both in cortex and hippocampus, but the number in cortex HFC was even smaller than in hippocampal HFC. Having a large number of disconnected nodes increases the effective connectivity density of the ‘connected’ part (neurons with any connections) of the network. The clustering coefficient was low for HFC compared to GFC and BFC for cortex, but there were no differences for hippocampus. There was not much difference observed in the efficiency across frequencies both in cortex and hippocampus. Assortativity was significantly different across frequency scales in cortex. For cortex HFC, assortativity had a consistently positive value, and in the other two scales it had negative values. Again, there were no differences across frequency ranges in hippocampus.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Summary of findings</title>
<p>We have shown that the wavelet transform can categorize pairwise neuronal cross-correlations into different frequency ranges. Some cross-correlation patterns suggested synaptic communication and some implied correlation due to other mechanisms, such as common drives, gamma/beta/theta rhythms, and long-term inhibitions. We have also shown that correlations were observed in 4 frequency ranges (HFC, GFC, BFC, TFC), and they can show different network structures. Among all the networks, the cortex HFC networks were the most different. They had positive assortativity, a smaller decay length, and a shorter tail of the degree distribution. The hippocampal networks at different frequency ranges showed less diversity. These results suggest that measurements of functional connectivity at multiple frequency ranges, especially with high temporal resolution recordings, are important to illustrate the differences of functional networks.</p>

<title>Functional connectivity and anatomical connectivity</title>
<p>We have introduced a new method to obtain functional connectivity in different frequency ranges. What do these different frequency ranges say about the underlying synaptic connectivity in these tissues? It is difficult to determine from cross-correlation alone whether a pair of neurons is synaptically connected. However, because synaptic connectivity is known to have temporal scales of a few milliseconds, some researchers have argued that cross-correlograms with sharp peaks at short delays may indicate direct synaptic connections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Csicsvari1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Barth1">[60]</xref>. In the present work, the majority of connections in this class would fall into the HFC category because of its temporal sharpness. Indeed such examples can be observed in HFC in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105324-g003">Figure 3A</xref>. On the other hand, it is less likely that we can associate lower frequency range connectivity with direct synaptic connections because most of them were non-delayed. Again, we did not try to assess whether or not HFC was mostly due to monosynaptic connectivity, but it is reasonable to think that the functional network structure presented by HFC was closer to the structural synaptic connectivity than were the functional networks presented at the lower frequency ranges.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4c">
<title>Degree distribution in cortex and hippocampus</title>
<p>There are a few reports about the degree distribution of neuronal networks. In rat and mouse hippocampus, the degree distribution of the functional connections is scale-free <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Bonifazi1">[12]</xref> (calcium imaging; acute slices; cross-correlation connectivity; thousands of neurons; 50–150 ms time bins). In rat cortex, the degree distribution falls as fast as random networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Perin1">[61]</xref> (simultaneous patch clamp; acute slices; monosynaptic connectivity; 6 pyramidal neurons). In cat visual cortex, the degree distribution also falls as fast as a random network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Yu1">[62]</xref> (extracellular electrophysiology; in-vivo under visual stimulation; maximum entropy connectivity; 10 neurons; 2 ms time bins).</p>
<p>In our preparations we measured the degree-distribution in 100-neuron networks. The degree-distributions of all the networks had longer tails than that of random networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105324-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Cortex HFC had a relatively shorter tail compared to other networks, and was closest to the degree distribution of an exponential network. All the other networks had longer tails than all the model networks including a subsampled scale-free network. Differences between cortex and hippocampus were observed clearly in HFC. The degree distribution in cortex HFC (exponential) does not match with the previous reports (random). However, it is difficult to directly compare our results with these previous results due to differences of animal species and preparations, limitations of the number of neurons or temporal resolution, and definitions of connectivity. We are also uncertain whether we are able to expect that a simple model distribution matches our data without distinguishing different cell types, as different cell types may have different connectivity patterns.</p>
<p>We note that because the possible number of connections between neuron pairs is proportional to the number of neurons squared, our MEA, which has 512 electrodes, was able to collect a great amount of cross-correlation data. Thus, this detailed evaluation of the degree distribution is a new result that utilized the advantage of the large-scale multielectrode-array. We also note that MEAs with an even greater number of electrodes have recently become available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Hierlemann1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Berdondini1">[10]</xref>. Brain slice experiments performed with these very-large-scale MEAs may potentially benefit from the computational methods described herein.</p>

<title>The significance of this research in the field</title>
<p>In 2013, a significant US national project in neuroscience called the ‘BRAIN Initiative’ was announced. One of the three goals of this project is “to understand circuit function” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Staal1">[104]</xref>. Obviously, this goal requires non-trivial development of data analysis methods and tools. In this paper, we demonstrated that high temporal resolution is an essential key to understand neuronal correlations. Optical methods are indeed useful for recording large numbers of neurons, but their typical temporal resolution for large populations is limited to ∼50 ms. With this temporal resolution, any functional connections above ∼10 Hz (Nyquist frequency of 50 ms resolution) will not be observable as we have seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105324-g009">Figure 9</xref>. Even in the best of circumstances, the temporal resolution of calcium imaging is ∼10 ms (e.g., see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105324-g002">Figure 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105324-g003">3f</xref> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105324-Alivisatos1">[105]</xref>), with Nyquist frequency ∼50 Hz; it is still out of our putative “synaptic” correlation frequency range (HFC). Electrophysiology can achieve much higher temporal resolution.</p>
<p>We have developed a methodological framework to compare network structure of neuronal networks at multiple frequency ranges. This framework can be applied to any neuronal system as long as recordings of ∼100 neurons with high temporal resolution are possible. Therefore, this same method can be applied to in-vivo and in vitro acute brain slice data as well as to the organotypic cultured brain slice data presented in this paper. It can be applied to different brain regions, with or without genetic modifications and/or pharmacological modifications. Given all these possibilities, this method can serve as a general tool for examining the microscopic functional networks of the brain.</p>
