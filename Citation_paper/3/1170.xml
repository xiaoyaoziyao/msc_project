<abstract>
<p>Blood filtration in the kidney glomerulus is essential for physiological homeostasis. The filtration apparatus of the kidney glomerulus is composed of three distinct components: the fenestrated endothelial cells, the glomerular basement membrane, and interdigitating foot processes of podocytes that form the slit diaphragm. Recent studies have demonstrated that podocytes play a crucial role in blood filtration and in the pathogenesis of proteinuria and glomerular sclerosis; however, the molecular mechanisms that organize the podocyte filtration barrier are not fully understood. In this study, we suggest that tight junction protein 1 (Tjp1 or ZO-1), which is encoded by <italic>Tjp1</italic> gene, plays an essential role in establishing the podocyte filtration barrier. The podocyte-specific deletion of <italic>Tjp1</italic> down-regulated the expression of podocyte membrane proteins, impaired the interdigitation of the foot processes and the formation of the slit diaphragm, resulting in glomerular dysfunction. We found the possibility that podocyte filtration barrier requires the integration of two independent units, the pre-existing epithelial junction components and the newly synthesized podocyte-specific components, at the final stage in glomerular morphogenesis, for which <italic>Tjp1</italic> is indispensable. Together with previous findings that <italic>Tjp1</italic> expression was decreased in glomerular diseases in human and animal models, our results indicate that the suppression of <italic>Tjp1</italic> could directly aggravate glomerular disorders, highlights <italic>Tjp1</italic> as a potential therapeutic target.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Renal glomerulus is an indispensable system for ultrafiltration of the blood and ensures that essential plasma proteins are retained. Glomerular filtration apparatus is composed of three distinct components: the fenestrated endothelial cells, the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), and podocytes. Glomerular dysfunction is marked by the loss of protein in the urine or proteinuria, which leads to end-stage renal disease due to sclerosis of the glomerulus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Haraldsson1">[1]</xref>. Recent studies have clarified that the loss of function of the components of the glomerular podocyte has been implicated in progressive renal diseases such as diabetic nephropathy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-DAgati1">[2]</xref>. <italic>NPHS1</italic> and <italic>NPHS2</italic>, the responsible genes for Finnish-type congenital nephrotic syndrome and autosomal recessive steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, respectively, encode nephrin and podocin, both of which are expressed in podocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Kestila1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Boute1">[4]</xref>. Mutations in other podocyte-expressed molecules such as Î±-actinin-4 and CD2AP have also been associated with congenital nephrotic syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Kaplan1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Kim1">[6]</xref>. The mice that are deficient for these molecules have exhibited renal diseases; while the age of onset may be varied, indicating that the molecules expressed in the podocytes regulate glomerular functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Putaala1">[7]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Kos1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>Glomerular podocytes are highly differentiated epithelial cells that extend numerous actin-rich projections known as foot processes, which interdigitate and cover the capillary walls of the glomerulus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Pavenstadt1">[11]</xref>. At the site of interdigitation, a specialized intercellular junction, the slit diaphragm, forms to function as the final sieve of the glomerular filter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Grahammer1">[12]</xref>. Previous studies have indicated that these slit diaphragms are modified tight junctions or adherens junctions, both of which play crucial roles in the epithelial tissue architecture as apical junctional complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Reiser1">[13]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-George1">[15]</xref>. During the podocyte differentiation, the structures of the apical junctional complexes disappear and are replaced by the slit diaphragms; several components of the apical junctional complexes, including P-cadherin, Î²-catenin, and tight junction protein 1 (Tjp1 or ZO-1) are then localized at the slit diaphragm and form molecular complexes with the actin filaments and podocyte-specific proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Schnabel1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Shono1">[17]</xref>. In addition, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologue of Tjp1 as well as nephrin and podocin are expressed in nephrocytes, which have structural and functional similarities with podocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Weavers1">[18]</xref>, suggesting the possibility that the essential elements for the filtration system have been molecularly and architecturally conserved during evolution.</p>
<p>The several previous studies have indicated that tight junctions and <italic>Tjp1</italic> are implicated in glomerular disorders. Tight junctions reappear between adjoining foot processes during certain proteinuria-associated glomerular diseases and animal models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Caulfield1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Kurihara1">[20]</xref>. <italic>Tjp1</italic> expression is significantly decreased in the glomeruli of human diabetic kidneys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Kurihara1">[20]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Li1">[22]</xref>. Furthermore, animal models of both type 1 and 2 diabetes including <italic>db/db</italic> mice and pharmacologically-induced diabetic rats have exhibited the reduction and redistribution of Tjp1 in glomerular podocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Kurihara1">[20]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Li1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>These observations suggest the possibility that the glomerular filtration system is affected by <italic>Tjp1</italic> under physiological and pathological conditions; however, its direct and functional relevance remains unclear. In the current study, to improve our understanding of how the glomerular filtration system is regulated, we specifically inactivated <italic>Tjp1</italic> in glomerular podocytes in mice and found that <italic>Tjp1</italic> plays an essential role in the formation and maintenance of the podocyte filtration barrier.</p>

<title>Podocyte-specific deletion of <italic>Tjp1</italic> leads to global glomerulosclerosis</title>
<p>To delete <italic>Tjp1</italic> specifically from podocytes, we utilized newly generated <italic>Tjp1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0106621.s001">Fig. S1</xref>) and <italic>Nphs1-Cre</italic> transgenic mice, which drive Cre recombinase expression in podocytes under nephrin promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Asano1">[23]</xref>. First, we verified the podocytes-specific <italic>Tjp1</italic> inactivation by staining kidney sections from <italic>Tjp1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice and <italic>Nphs1-Cre: Tjp1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0106621.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). In the <italic>Nphs1-Cre: Tjp1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice, the signal for Tjp1 was absent from glomerular podocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0106621.s002">Fig. S2A</xref>), whereas a positive signal was observed in the endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, arrow and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0106621.s002">Fig. S2B</xref>), in the Bowman's capsule epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, double arrows and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0106621.s002">Fig. S2C</xref>), and the cellâcell junctions of the renal tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, arrowheads). The reduction of Tjp1 protein was also confirmed by Western blotting analysis for the glomerular lysates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0106621.s002">Fig. S2D</xref>). These data indicated that <italic>Tjp1</italic> was eliminated specifically from the podocytes. In addition, we examined the expression of the Tjp family members, Tjp2 and Tjp3 in the glomerulus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Tsukita1">[24]</xref>. Immunofluorescence analyses revealed that the intensity and staining pattern of either Tjp2 or Tjp3 was not altered in the <italic>Nphs1-Cre: Tjp1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice (<italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic>) compared with the pattern in the <italic>Tjp1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice (control) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0106621.s003">Fig. S3A and B</xref>), suggesting that these molecules could not compensate for the loss of <italic>Tjp1</italic> in the podocytes.</p>

<p>(A) Kidney sections from <italic>Tjp1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> and <italic>Nphs1-Cre: Tjp1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice were examined with the antibody against Tjp1. Tjp1 was specifically eliminated from podocytes, while it was detected in endothelial cells in the glomerulus in the <italic>Nphs1-Cre: Tjp1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice (arrow). The expression of Tjp1 in the Bowman's capsule epithelial cells (double arrows) and in the renal tubules (arrowheads) was also unaffected.

<p>The <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice were born according to Mendelian rules, but exhibited significant growth retardation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>) and severe proteinuria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Kidneys from the <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice at 6 weeks of age were pale and had a more granular surface compared with the kidneys from the control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). The histological analyses of these kidneys demonstrated that the renal pelvis was enlarged with atrophic renal papilla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>, top panels); prominent glomerulosclerosis and dilated tubuli containing proteinaceous casts were detected in the <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>, bottom panels). We found more than 90% of glomeruli showed sclerosis in the <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>). Transmission electron microscopy revealed the loss of the slit diaphragm, the disruption of foot processes, and the aberrantly thickened, tortuous GBM in the <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice at 6 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate whether the kidney disorder caused by the podocyte-specific <italic>Tjp1</italic> inactivation had a similarity with human glomerular diseases, we performed pathological analyses that have been commonly utilized in the diagnosis of human renal disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-DAgati2">[25]</xref>. In the <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice, Jones' silver and Masson's trichrome staining revealed extensive deposits of the basement membrane components. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g001">Fig. 1H and I</xref>). These pathological characteristics were comparable to those in patients with global glomerulosclerosis.</p>
<p>Taken together, these data provided evidence that <italic>Tjp1</italic> is indispensable for the maintenance of glomerular structure and function and that the elimination of <italic>Tjp1</italic> leads to global glomerulosclerosis.</p>

<title><italic>Tjp1</italic> is required for the establishment of the glomerulus in immature mice</title>
<p>In mice, the renal glomerulus is fully established at 2â3 weeks after birth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Niimura1">[26]</xref>. To define the effect of <italic>Tjp1</italic> deficiency on the establishment of the renal glomerulus, we performed retrospective analyses. The histology of the <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice at 4 weeks of age demonstrated a severe sclerotic glomeruli (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0106621.s003">Fig. S3C</xref>). A milder disorder that was still evident histologically was observed in the <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice at 2 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0106621.s003">Fig. S3D</xref>). At the ultrastructural level, we found effacement of the foot processes and slit diaphragm impairment in the <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice, whereas the control mice displayed an intact arrangement of foot processes with preserved filtration slits at 2 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0106621.s003">Fig. S3E</xref>). We also noticed that the GBM is mostly well-organized with the clear three layers in the <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice at 2 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0106621.s003">Fig. S3E</xref>), while the organization of GBM is severely impaired at 6 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>), suggesting that the loss of slit diaphragms and foot process effacement precede the disorganization of the basement membrane in this mutant mouse. These findings, together with the presence of severe proteinuria in the <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice at 2 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0106621.s003">Fig. S3F</xref>), indicate that <italic>Tjp1</italic> is necessary for the structural and functional establishment of renal glomerulus in immature mice.</p>

<title>The interdigitating foot process architecture is disrupted in <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice</title>
<p>The interdigitating foot processes are a crucial portion of the glomerular filtration apparatus, and it has been demonstrated that the foot processes retract and are lost in the glomerular diseases that are typically associated with proteinuria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-DAgati1">[2]</xref>. In fact, mice that were missing the slit diaphragm components have been shown to lose their foot processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Shih1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Kos1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Jones1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Tryggvason1">[28]</xref>. To gain further insight into the effect of <italic>Tjp1</italic> deletion on the interdigitating foot process architecture, the kidneys from both the control and <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).</p>
<p>In the 6-week-old mice that did not have <italic>Tjp1</italic> in podocytes, the podocyte foot processes were spreading out randomly. The interdigitating architecture was completely disorganized and the adhesion of foot processes to the GBM appeared to be impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). In addition, the primary processes were flatter compared with those in the control mice, suggesting the possibility that the organization of the actin filaments might be affected by the inactivation of <italic>Tjp1</italic>.</p>

<title>The compromised foot process interdigitation and aberrant distribution of the slit diaphragm components in <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice.</title>
<p>(AâC) SEM analyses of glomeruli from the control and <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice. Foot processes were severely disorganized in the <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice at 6 weeks of age (A). The loss of interdigitation and the impaired adhesion to the GBM of the podocyte foot processes was detected in the <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice at 2 weeks of age (B). At an earlier time point, 1 week of age, the foot processes were attached to the GBM but the interdigitation was disorganized in the <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice (C). Scale bars, 2 Âµm (A, B, C top panels), 0.5 Âµm (C bottom panels). (D) Immunofluorescence analyses of podocyte components: nephrin, podocin, Fyn, and synaptopodin (Synpo). The distribution of the slit diaphragm membrane proteins, nephrin and podocin, was fragmented and the signal intensity was reduced in the <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice at 1 week and 2 weeks of age. The signal of the actin-binding protein Synpo was increased in the <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice at 2 weeks of age. Fyn, a member of src family kinase, was not affected.

<title>The localization of the specific podocyte components is affected by <italic>Tjp1</italic> elimination</title>
<p>To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying these alterations, we examined the distribution of the podocyte components in the mice at 1 and 2 weeks of age. In the control mice, the slit diaphragm membrane proteins, nephrin and podocin, were distributed in a linear pattern presumably along the glomerular capillary wall; in contrast, those proteins appeared as discontinuous dots in the <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice at both 1 and 2 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>).

<p>(A and B) The glomerular lysates from the control and <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice at 1 week and 2 weeks of age were analyzed by Western blotting with the antibodies against podocyte components (A). The results were quantified (B). Nephrin and podocin were significantly downregulated in the <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice both at 1 week and 2 weeks of age.

The expression level of CD2AP, Fyn, and Î±-actinin4 (ACTN4) did not exhibit differences between the control and <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice. (C) mRNA expression of podocyte components was determined by qPCR. The difference in the neprhin and podocin mRNA levels between the control and <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice at 1 week and 2 weeks of age did not correlate with the reduction in the protein levels of those molecules. The mRNA level of most other molecules did not show these alterations, although some of them did exhibit upregulation without an increase in protein levels except for Synpo at 2 weeks of age. (D and E) The protein expression of the podocyte components in the developing glomerulus was examined by Western blotting. The kidney lysates from the control and <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice at P0 and P3 were probed with antibodies against podocyte components (D).

<p>To investigate whether the alteration in protein expression occurred at a transcriptional level, we performed quantitative PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). A substantial correlation between the protein and mRNA levels was not observed for nephrin and podocin. The Synpo mRNA level was increased in the <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice at 2 weeks of age, which was consistent with the alteration in the protein level. However, it was not clear if the increase in the Synpo protein was a consequence of transcriptional upregulation because the mRNA levels of several of the other molecules also increased without exhibiting an increase in the protein level. Taken together, the alterations in the protein expression of nephrin, podocin, and Synpo were probably post-transcriptional events.</p>
<p>To determine when the reduction of nephrin and podocin protein started, we analyzed the kidney lysates from newborn mice (P0) and mice on postnatal day 3 (P3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g003">Fig. 3D and E</xref>). Both nephrin and podocin were specifically downregulated by P3. At P0, the nephrin protein level in the <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice appeared to be comparable with the level in the control mice; however, podocin exhibited an obvious decrease in the <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g003">Fig. 3D and E</xref>). Therefore, the initial alteration in protein expression after the elimination of <italic>Tjp1</italic> in podocytes appeared to be the reduction of podocin.</p>

<title>The stability of podocin is prolonged in the presence of Tjp1</title>
<p>To examine whether the expression of Tjp1affected the stability of nephrin and/or podocin, we established a stable cell line that expressed both proteins with or without Tjp1. The expression and the complex formation of the transfected molecules were confirmed by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Then we inhibited de novo protein synthesis in the transfectants using cycloheximide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). The expression of nephrin was reduced to almost half of the previous amount after 8 h, while a 50% reduction in podocin levels was observed after 2â4 h in the absence of Tjp1. When Tjp1 was coexpressed, the reduction of podocin was attenuated, while the expression of nephrin did not change significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g004">Fig. 4B and C</xref>). Therefore, the podocin protein appeared to be stabilized by forming complex with Tjp1.</p>

<title><italic>Tjp1</italic> affects the stability of podocin protein and the maturation of the slit diaphragm.</title>
<p>(A) Nephrin and podocin were introduced into L cells with or without Tjp1. The expression of the transfected genes was examined by Western blotting of the cell lysastes and the protein complex formation was analyzed by the immunoprecipitation assay (IP) using anti-Tjp1 antibody or control IgG. (B and C) Cells stably expressing nephrin and podocin with or without Tjp1 were treated with 10 ÂµM cycloheximide for an indicated amount of time. The protein levels of nephrin and podocin were analyzed by Western blotting (B) and the results were quantified (C). The relative expression of the band intensity at time 0 for each protein was defined as 100%. Data shows mean Â± SEM of nâ=â3.

<p>We also explored a possible mechanism for the increase of Synpo expression in the <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice. The increase of Synpo expression was detected at 2 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>); rather later than the decrease of podocin or nephrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>), and almost at the same time when foot processes were found to be spread out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Since the Synpo expression was not significantly increased at 1 week of age when the foot process adhesion to the GBM was intact but the interdigitation was altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), we speculated that the alteration of foot process adhesion to the GBM might affect the expression of Synpo. To address this possibility, the mouse podocytes were seeded on type-I collagen-coated or uncoated plates and cultured for â¼16 h, and the Synpo expression in the podocytes was compared by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). We found that the amount of Synpo protein from the cells cultured on uncoated plates was greater than the amount from the coated plates, suggesting the possibility that the decreased adhesion to the basement membrane could upregulate the expression of Synpo protein in podocytes.</p>

<title><italic>Tjp1</italic> is potentially indispensable for the integration of slit diaphragm components in developing podocytes</title>
<p>It has been demonstrated that there are different developmental stages of the glomerulus present in the newborn mouse kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Niimura1">[26]</xref>. At the comma-shaped body stage, the immature podocytes differentiate from the columnar epithelial cells which are connected by tight and adherens junctions. Those junctions migrate toward the basal domains during the S-shaped body stage. In the meantime, podocyte-specific molecules such as nephrin and podocin become to be expressed in the late S-shaped body stage. Subsequently, the cells begin to form broad foot processes during the capillary loop stage, and the tight and adherens junctions disappear and are replaced by the slit diaphragms during the maturing stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Pavenstadt1">[11]</xref>. To assess whether <italic>Tjp1</italic> was implicated in the generation of slit diaphragms, we investigated the distribution of podocin and the structure of foot processes in developing podocytes in the newborn mouse kidney.</p>
<p>Before the maturing stage, in which the podocyte foot processes were not sufficiently differentiated to form slit diaphragms yet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Pavenstadt1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Niimura1">[26]</xref>, podocin was detected around nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>, arrowheads) and basolateral membrane domains with a dot-like pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>, arrows) both in the control and <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice in a similar manner. At the maturing stage, when slit diaphragms are formed between interdigitating foot processes, the linear staining pattern of podocin was observed in the control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>, arrows in control). On the other hand, podocin did not exhibit the organized linear distribution pattern in <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice. Instead, podocin was observed as discontinuous dots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>, arrows in <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic>) as that in the 1-week-old or 2-week-old <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g002">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0106621.s004">Fig. S4A</xref>).</p>
<p>In several previous studies, the direct implication of the podocyte component in the generation of slit diaphragms was assessed by examining the ultrastructure of developing podocytes in newborn mutant mice that were missing the podocyte component <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Miner1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Rohr1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Roselli2">[34]</xref>. According to those studies, we analyzed podocyte ultrastructure in P0 control and <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of regularly spaced foot processes and slit diaphragms in maturing podocytes in P0 control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g004">Fig. 4G</xref>, top panel). In contrast, foot processes were located close together and normal slit diaphragms were not observed in maturing podocytes in P0 <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g004">Fig. 4G</xref>, bottom panel). In addition, albumin was detected in the urine from the P0 <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g004">Fig. 4H</xref>). From these data, we assumed that Tjp1 could play a role in the generation of normal slit diaphragms for the blood filtration.</p>
</sec></sec><sec id="s3">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated that the podocyte-specific deletion of <italic>Tjp1</italic>, a component of tight junctions in epithelial cells, impaired the formation and maintenance of blood filtration apparatus. <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice exhibited extensive non-selective proteinuria. In addition to albumin, proteins larger than albumin were seen in the urine of <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice not only at 6 weeks of age, but also at 2 weeks of age and P0. And we found more than 90% of glomeruli in the 6-week-old <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice showed sclerosis. These data suggest that the loss of Tjp1 in podocytes results in persistent proteinuria and disturbance of renal function with the reduction of glomerular filtration ability and lead to growth retardation.</p>
<p>In the <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice, the loss of slit diaphragms and foot process effacement appear to precede disorganization of the basement membrane from the observations that the GBM is mostly well-organized with the clear three layers at 2 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0106621.s003">Fig. S3E</xref>), while the organization of GBM is severely impaired at 6 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>). In addition, the enlarged renal pelvis and atrophic renal papilla were observed in the <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice at 6 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>), but not at 2 weeks of age, indicating that this alteration was secondary consequence of profound damage of the glomerulus. Since the peritubular capillary stems from the efferent arterioles, diffuse global glomerulosclerosis is thought to causes tubular hypoxia, especially in the papilla, which is most vulnerable. Severe nephrotic syndrome also decreases circulating plasma volume, which also causes hypoperfusion and hypoxia of the kidney. The development of hypoperfusion in the <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice is supported by pale appearance of the <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). We therefore speculate that hypoxia is a potential mechanism underlining the papillary atrophy.</p>
<p>At the molecular level, the deletion of <italic>Tjp1</italic> in podocytes prevented the proper spatial arrangement of podocin at the prospective slit diaphragm region in the maturing stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>). In addition, the stability of podocin, which has a short half-life, was decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g004">Fig. 4B and C</xref>). Taking into consideration the lack of well-developed foot process interdigitation in the SEM image of the glomeruli of <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice at 1 week of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), we speculate that these molecular alterations could be associated with the impairment of normal interdigitated architecture of foot processes, and lead to the disturbance of the foot process adhesion to the GBM as observed in the <italic>Tjp1<sup>â³pod</sup></italic> mice at 2 week of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>), possibly because of the inability to handle the filtration pressure. In older mice, the foot processes remained disorganized but did not completely retract or disappear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106621-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). This type of structural alteration may be similar to some models of glomerular disease that exhibit foot process flattening, rather than the complete loss <italic>in vivo</italic>, which is correlated with an increased podocyte spreading <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Ma1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-George2">[36]</xref>.</p>
<p>The previous studies have shown that P-cadherin and Î²-catenin, both of which are adherens junction components, were not necessary for the development and maintenance of the slit diaphragm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Radice1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Dai1">[38]</xref>. Therefore, slit diaphragms could be characterized as modified tight junctions rather than adherens junctions. We speculate that for the generation of the functional slit diaphragms, the integration of two independent units, the pre-existing epithelial junction components and the newly synthesized podocyte-specific components, would be required at the final step of podocyte differentiation, in which Tjp1 is implicated. This hypothesis needs to be clarified by further studies.</p>
<p>We had previously demonstrated that the constitutive inactivation of <italic>Tjp1</italic> in mice resulted in an early embryonic lethality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Katsuno1">[39]</xref>; thus, it was unlikely that <italic>Tjp1</italic> was actually mutated in congenital human glomerular diseases. Nonetheless, considering the previous reports that <italic>Tjp1</italic> expression was decreased in glomerular diseases in human and animal models and our findings in the current study, the suppression of <italic>Tjp1</italic> could directly aggravate human glomerular disorders, which highlighted <italic>Tjp1</italic> as a potential therapeutic target.</p>

<title>Analyses of expression levels of the podocyte proteins in the glomerulus</title>
<p>Mouse glomerular fractions were isolated from the renal cortex using nylon mesh with the standard sieving method and homogenized in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 Âµg/mL leupeptin, 5 Âµg/mL antipain, 5 Âµg/mL chymostatin, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0). For mice that were younger than 1 week of age, protein lysates were extracted from the whole kidney. Protein concentrations of the supernatants after centrifugation (15,000 rpm Ã 10 min) were determined by detergent-compatible protein quantification assays (Bio-Rad); equal amounts of protein were used for the SDS-PAGE, which was followed by Western blotting analyses. After incubation with the primary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare) and chemiluminescent substrate (Bio-Rad) were applied.</p>

<title>Cell culture, transfection, and biochemical assays</title>
<p>Mouse fibroblast L-cells, in which endogenous Tjp1 was expressed at a very low level, were maintained on Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and transfected with pCAG-IRES-GFP-Nephrin, pCAG-Puro-Podocin, and pCAG-Neo-Tjp1 or pCAG-Neo control vector. Transfected cells were cultured in the presence of 500 Âµg/mL neomycin and 10 Âµg/mL puromycin for 14 days; cells positive for green fluorescent protein were collected using a cell sorter (BD). The expression of the transfected genes was confirmed by Western blotting. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were precleared with protein G-Sepharose 4FF beads (GE Healthcare) and incubated with the primary antibody or control IgG for 1 hr. Protein G-Sepharose 4FF beads were added to capture the immuno-complex, then washed with buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% Glycerol, 1% NP-40, 1 mM PMSF, pH 7.4), followed by elution with Laemmli sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% Glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoehtanol, 60 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8). For the protein stability assay, the transfected cells were treated with 10 ÂµM cycloheximide (Wako Chemicals) and lysed with Laemmli sample buffer at the indicated times. The mouse podocyte cell line was a kind gift from P. Mundel and K. Asanuma, and cultured as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0106621-Mundel1">[41]</xref>. The differentiated cells were seeded onto type-I collagen dishes or non-coated petri dishes and cultured for 16 h, then lysed with Laemmli sample buffer. The cell lysates were processed for SDS-PAGE, which was followed by Western blotting analyses.</p>

<p><bold>Generation of </bold><bold><italic>Tjp1</italic></bold><bold>-floxed mice.</bold> (A) Targeting strategy using the Cre/loxP system. Schematic of the mouse genomic locus for <italic>Tjp1</italic> (ZO-1 gene) is shown. The targeting vector introduces loxP-FRT-flanked Neo and F3-loxP-flanked Puro resistance cassettes 5â² and 3â², respectively, of <italic>Tjp1</italic> exon 4. After Flp recombination, the conditional allele contains a loxP-flanked exon 4 with residual 5â² FRT and 3â² F3 sites. Cre-recombination deletes the floxed exon 4, yielding the constitutive KO allele. Genotyping PCR primers to identify wild-type, <italic>Tjp1</italic>-floxed hetero (<italic>Tjp1<sup>flox/+</sup></italic>) and homozygous (<italic>Tjp1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>) animals are indicated with orange bars. The drawing is not to scale. (B) Confirmation of homologous recombination at the 5â²- and 3â²-sites. Schematic representation of the wild-type and targeted allele. The exon (Ex)-intron organization is shown with the selection casettes (Neo, Puro), the floxed arm of homology (FA), the short and long arms of homology (SA and LA, respectively), the 5â²- and 3â²-end probes (5e1 and 3e1, respectively) and the XcmI and BclII restriction enzyme cutting sites. Genomic DNA from the indicated ES cell clones were digested with XcmI and probed with 5e1 by Southern blot, showing an expected 10 kb band indicative homologous recombination at the 5â²-end (top panels). Digestion with BclII followed by Southern blot hybridization with probe 3e1 yields an expected 17.4 kb band showing homologous recombination at the 3â²-end (bottom panels). (C) Confirmation of single site integration. To confirm that homologous recombination only occurred at the <italic>Tjp1</italic> locus, genomic DNA was digested with PacI and AvrII and probed with a puromycin specific probe (puro). A single band of the expected 13.8 kb was obtained, consistent with a single site integration at the <italic>Tjp1</italic> locus. (D) Genotyping by PCR. Agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR products from wild-type, <italic>Tjp1<sup>flox/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Tjp1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice using the primers indicated in panel A. Fragments of 279 bp and 471 bp are indicative of the wild-type and floxed allele, respectively. WT, wild-type.</p>
