<abstract>
<p>Despite the actual therapeutic approaches for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), efficient and secure alternative options remain a research focus. In this context, anthocyanins seem promising natural anti-inflammatory agents, but their action mechanisms and efficacy as compared with established drugs still require more clarification. The main aim of this study was to compare the anti-inflammatory action of a chemically characterized anthocyanin-rich fraction (ARF), obtained from Portuguese blueberries (<italic>Vaccinium corymbosum</italic> L.), with that of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), a first-line drug in IBD, in a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis rat model. Such fraction showed a high content and great molecular diversity of anthocyanins, with malvidin-3-galactoside and petunidin-3-arabinoside in the highest concentrations. After daily administration by intragastric infusion for 8 days, ARF, at a molar anthocyanin concentration about 30 times lower than 5-ASA, showed a higher effectiveness in counteracting the intestinal inflammation, as assessed by i) body weight variation and colon damage score, ii) reduction in leukocyte infiltration, iii) increase in antioxidant defenses and iv) by downregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in colon tissue homogenates. The strong inhibition of COX-2 expression seems to be a crucial anti-inflammatory mechanism common to both ARF and 5-ASA, but the additional higher abilities of anthocyanins to downregulate iNOS and to decrease leukocytes infiltration and to increase antioxidant defenses in colon may account for the much higher anti-inflammatory action of anthocyanins. These data may contribute to the development of a promising natural approach in IBD management.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and relapsing disorder of the gastrointestinal tract (GI), associated with an exacerbated intestinal immune response to an innocuous stimulus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref001">1</xref>], leading to an upregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators which may trigger the onset and perpetuation of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>Although several therapeutic strategies have been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref003">3</xref>], they are not free of adverse effects and so the development of new effective and safer ones remains a focus of interest. In this context, the use of natural products and dietary components has been gaining popularity for the treatment of inflammatory disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref006">6</xref>], but scientific evidences regarding their efficacy and action mechanisms are still required.</p>
<p>Blueberries are among the fruits with potential health benefits associated with their high content in anthocyanins, a group of flavonoids widespread in human diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref007">7</xref>], which have been reported as potential therapeutic agents for several inflammatory diseases, including IBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref009">9</xref>]. Anthocyanins have been largely recognized by their potent antioxidant properties and ability to modulate crucial signalling pathways and gene regulation of several inflammatory enzymes and cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref013">13</xref>]. Therefore, beyond these modulatory roles, their antioxidant activity related to the capacity to scavenge reactive oxygen and nitrogen species or to activate cellular endogenous antioxidant systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref015">15</xref>], may be of major importance in countering the oxidative stress in IBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Despite the controversy regarding the bioavailability of anthocyanins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref018">18</xref>], they can reach concentrations up to several hundred micromolar in the gastrointestinal tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref019">19</xref>], due to their abundance in diet and poor intestinal absorption. Recent studies have already shown that oral consumption of berry anthocyanins attenuates inflammation in mice models of colitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref020">20</xref>], but more information is required concerning their anti-inflammatory action mechanisms and efficacy as compared with standard anti-inflammatory drugs used in IBD patients.</p>
<p>Thus, in this context, we have already demonstrated, in an <italic>in vitro</italic> intestinal cell model, the higher anti-inflammatory activity of cyanidin-3-glucoside in comparison with 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref013">13</xref>], a well-established anti-inflammatory drug in IBD. Now, in this work, we aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory action of an anthocyanin-rich fraction (ARF) of Portuguese blueberries (<italic>Vaccinium corymbosum</italic> L.), in a TNBS-induced colitis rat model, in comparison with 5-ASA.</p>
<p>The efficacy of the treatments was firstly evaluated by body weight variations and extent of colonic mucosal injury. To gain a better insight into the anti-inflammatory mechanisms involved, we assessed in the colon tissue, i) the active myeloperoxidase (MPO) and the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, as markers of inflammation, ii) the intracellular redox status, through evaluation of glutathione (GSH)/glutathione disulphide (GSSG) ratio and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity, and iii) the expression of the pro-inflammatory enzymes, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2).</p>

<title>Blueberry samples</title>
<p>The blueberries (<italic>Vaccinium corymbosum</italic> L, cultivar Bluecrop) were collected at the time of peak production, from the central region of Portugal. They were obtained from biological agriculture (Biogrêsso, Portugal) and kept frozen at -80°C until use.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec005">
<title>Preparation of anthocyanin-rich fraction</title>
<p>The anthocyanin-rich fraction was prepared according to Oszmianski, et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref021">21</xref>], as modified by Youdim (2002) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref022">22</xref>]. Briefly, a total extract was obtained by homogenization of 30 g of the frozen fruits in 150 ml of methanol, acetone, water and formic acid mixture (40:40:20:0.1 v/v/v/v). Then, the extract was centrifuged at 2000<italic>g</italic> for 10 min and the supernatant was dried by rotatory evaporation at 40°C under vacuum. The resulting residue was dissolved in deionized water and applied to an activated Sep-Pak C18 column (Waters Corporation, Milford, Massachusetts, USA). The column was then washed with 2 volumes of acidified water (0.01% HCl) to remove sugars and phenolic acids, and 2 volumes of ethyl acetate to elute other phenolic compounds. The anthocyanins were eluted only in the presence of acidified methanol (0.01% HCl) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref023">23</xref>]. This fraction was then dried at low pressure, and further resolubilized in a 0.9% NaCl solution. The anthocyanin-rich extract was kept at -80°C, under nitrogen, until use and will be further referred here as ARF.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec006">
<title>Total phenols and total anthocyanins assays</title>
<p>The total content in phenolic compounds was assessed spectrophotometrically by the Folin-Ciocalteau reagent, as described by George et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref024">24</xref>]. Results were expressed as grams of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per volume of ARF (L) and as milligrams of GAE per 100 g of blueberries.</p>
<p>Total monomeric anthocyanins in the ARF were estimated by a pH differential method described by Giusti et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref025">25</xref>], by using two buffer systems. The fraction was previously diluted at a ratio of 1:800 (v:v) either with 0.025 M KCl (pH 1) or with 0.4 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) and after an equilibration period (15 min), the absorbance spectrum of each solution was recorded between 400 and 700 nm in a Perkin Elmer Lambda 45 spectrophotometer. The anthocyanin content was calculated in terms of malvidin-3-glucoside (malv3glc) equivalent, using the maximum of absorbance measured around 530 nm, the molar absorptivity of 20200 and the molecular weight of 493.4. The results were expressed as grams of malv3glc equivalents/L of ARF and as milligrams of malv3glc equivalents/100 g blueberries.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec007">
<title>HPLC-DAD</title>
<p>The extract was analysed by HPLC with direct injection of the samples (20 μL) (Hitachi L-2130) in a reverse phase C18 column with 250 x 4.6 mm i.d. (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany); the detection was performed at 511 nm, using a diode array detector (DAD) (Hitachi L-2455). The solvents used (mobile phase) were A: H<sub>2</sub>O/HCOOH (9:1), and B: H<sub>2</sub>O/CH<sub>3</sub>CN/HCOOH (6:3:1), in a gradient of 20–85% from solution B for 70 min at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The column was then washed with 100% of solution B for 20 min. Before each use, the column was stabilized for the initial conditions for another 20 min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref026">26</xref>].</p>

<sec id="sec008">
<title>Animals and experimental design</title>
<p>Four-week-old male Wistar rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Barcelona, Spain), and maintained under standard conditions (temperature 24–25°C, humidity 70–75%, lighting regimen of 12 h light/dark cycle), in plastic cages with free access to water and pellet food. Animal welfare and experimental procedures were carried out in accordance to the European Union regarding animal experimentation (Directive of the European Counsel 86/609/EEC) and approved by the Portuguese National Authority for Animal Health (Direcção-Geral de Alimentação e Veterinária—DGAV). All efforts were made to minimize the animals suffering and to reduce the number of animals used. An early humane endpoint criteria was adopted: although weight loss was expected in this disease model, if this loss exceeded 20% of the initial weight, animals would be euthanized. The rats were randomly divided into four groups: (i) non-colitic control (<italic>n</italic> = 10); (ii) TNBS-colitic control (<italic>n</italic> = 10); (iii) TNBS-induced rats treated with ARF 10 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 10); and (iv) TNBS-induced rats treated with 5-ASA 100 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 10). The ARF and the therapeutic agent were administered solubilized in a mixture of 0.9% NaCl and 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose (vehicle), in a single dose by oral gavage, during 8 days after colitis induction by TNBS.</p>
<p>The dose of ARF used was chosen on basis of preliminary experiments, as the lowest to obtain safety and efficacy in the referred colitis rat model, and that of 5-ASA was as reported in literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref027">27</xref>] and taking into consideration the dose translation from animal to humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref028">28</xref>].</p>

<sec id="sec009">
<title>Induction of colitis</title>
<p>Colonic inflammation was induced as described by Siddiqui et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref029">29</xref>]. Rats were fasted overnight and were then anesthetized with ketamine (50 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>) and chlorpromazine (2.3 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>), to allow the rectal administration of TNBS. Briefly, the tip of a polyethylene catheter was advanced transanally 8 cm into the distal colon and a single dose of TNBS was instilled intraluminally (10 mg of TNBS dissolved in 0.25 mL of 50% ethanol) to induce colitis. The animals were maintained in a head-down position for approximately 60 seconds to prevent leakage of the infusate. Non-colitic control group was subjected to the same procedure, infusing a saline buffer instead of TNBS. After one day, the rats were treated for 8 days as assigned previously.</p>

<title>Macroscopic assessment and scoring of TNBS colitis severity</title>

<title>Myeloperoxidase activity</title>
<p>Colonic mucosa was assayed for MPO activity as described by Stucchi et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref031">31</xref>], with slight modifications. Samples excised from each animal were thawed, and approximately 30–50 mg of mucosa was homogenized on ice with a Polytron tissue homogenizer in 4 ml of ice-cold 5 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). To remove haemoglobin and other blood products that could interfere with this assay, the homogenate was centrifuged at 30000<italic>g</italic>, for 30 min, at 4°C and the supernatants discarded and the pellet resuspended in phosphate buffer, for three times. Finally, the pellet was solubilized in 10 volumes of ice-cold hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (0.5%) in phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 6.0) and subjected to three cycles of freezing/thawing to extract the enzyme. The extract was allowed to stand at 4°C for 20 min and then centrifuged at 12500<italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4°C. MPO activity was evaluated in the supernatant, by mixing 10 μL of this supernatant with 2.99 mL of 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.167 mg.mL<sup>-1</sup> of <italic>o</italic>-dianisidine dihydrochloride and 0.0005% of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The absorbance decrease of the reaction mixture was monitored at 460 nm for 2 min. Results were expressed as U MPO.mg<sup>-1</sup> tissue, being one unit of MPO activity defined as the amount of enzyme that degrades 1 μmol of hydrogen peroxide per minute.</p>

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref033">33</xref>]. The samples were homogenized in cold saline solution (1:20 w/v) and centrifuged at 7000<italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatants were used to determine spectrophotometrically the mucosal ALP activity, by mixing 100 μL of each sample with 1 mL of glycine (50 mM, pH 10.4), containing 5.5 mM <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenylphosphate and 0.5 mM magnesium chloride. After incubation for 30 min at 37°C, 10 mL of 0.02 M sodium hydroxide were added to stop the enzymatic reaction, and the <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenol formed was measured at 405 nm. The protein content was determined by the Bradford reaction using the Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, USA), to express ALP activity as mU. g<sup>-1</sup> of protein.

<title>Measurement of GSH/GSSG ratio</title>
<p>Total glutathione and GSSG were quantified in colon samples by an enzymatic recycling assay, essentially as described by Griffith et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref034">34</xref>]. The colon samples were previously treated by homogenization in extraction buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.6% sulfosalicylic acid, 0.1 M KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> and 5 mM Na<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.5), followed by centrifugation at 3000<italic>g</italic>, at 4°C, for 10 min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref035">35</xref>]. Total glutathione (GSH + GSSG) was assessed in the supernatant in a 96-well plate. Briefly, 20 μL of supernatant was added to 120 μL of freshly prepared 5 mM DTNB plus glutathione reductase (1:1 v/v) in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer and 60 μL of 2.4 mM β-NADPH, also prepared in the same phosphate buffer. The absorbance due to the yellow dianion formed by the reaction of thiol groups and DTNB, was immediately read at 412 nm, using a Synergy HT plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments) and followed for 2 min, with reading intervals of 30 sec. For the GSSG determination, the procedure was similar but prior to the assay, the GSH was blocked by derivatization using 2-vinilpyridine, by incubating 100 μL of the tissue samples with 2 μL of this masking agent and 6 μL of triethanolamine, during 1 h at room temperature, in a fume hood. Colon glutathione content (total and oxidized) was calculated using concurrently run standard curves in nmol per mg of cellular protein, and expressed as GSH/GSSG ratio.</p>

<p>Colonic tissues were processed according to the method described by Sanchez-Fidalgo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref036">36</xref>] slightly modified. Briefly, frozen colonic tissues were weighed and homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8; 150 mM NaCl; 0.1% Triton X-100; 0.1% protease inhibitor cocktail; 1 mM PMSF; 0.5 mM EDTA; and 8 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>). Homogenates were incubated at 4°C for 2 h with stirring, and then cell debris were removed by centrifugation (12000<italic>g</italic>, 20 min, at 4°C) and the supernatants (cytoplasmic extracts) were collected and stored at -80°C until use. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Aliquots of the supernatant, containing equal amount of reduced and denaturated proteins (80 μg), were separated by SDS/PAGE electrophoresis in a 10% (v/v) acrylamide gel and further transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Amersham Biosciences, UK) by electroblotting, using the Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System of Bio-Rad (Hercules, California, USA). The membranes were blocked with skimmed milk in TBS-T buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween) to avoid non-specific binding. Afterwards the membranes were probed overnight, at 4°C, with specific primary antibodies against MPO, COX-2, iNOS and β-actin. Each membrane was then washed three times with TBS-T and incubated with the respective alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies, for 1 h, at room temperature. Immunodetection was performed by chemifluorescence after blots exposition to enhanced chemifluorescent reagent in a Typhoon 9000 scanner (Amersham Biosciences, UK) and analysed with the ImageQuant<sup>TM</sup> software from Amersham Biosciences (UK). β-Actin was used as control for protein loading.</p>

<title>The anthocyanin-rich fraction improved more efficiently than 5-ASA the recovery of body weight and the macroscopic colonic damage in TNBS-induced colitis in rats</title>
<p>During the study, the animals were constantly monitored for variations in body weight and general health. The inflammatory status in the TNBS-colitis control group was associated with severe anorexia and diarrhea, when compared to non-colitic control. Accordingly, as shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174116.g002">Fig 2A</xref></bold>, TNBS-colitis control group showed no significant weight gain with time, in contrast with the weight gain observed in healthy rats (115.7 ± 2.0%). Rats treated with ARF exhibited a significant recovery along the time, when compared with TNBS-colitis control group and the extent of recovery was clearly and statistically higher than that provided by 5-ASA, especially in the last two days. Notice that the observed benefits occurred at a concentration of anthocyanins about 30 times lower than that of 5-ASA (10 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> of ARF corresponds to 0.02 mmol.kg<sup>-1</sup> in terms of malvidin-3-glucoside, while 100 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> of 5-ASA corresponds to 0.65 mmol.kg<sup>-1</sup>).</p>

<p>By the end of the experiment, the mortality in the TNBS-colitis control group was found to be very small (1/10), compared with the healthy, non-colitic control (0/10), indicating that the induced colonic injury was not fatal within 8 days, and neither the ARF nor 5-ASA, in the doses used, increased it. Additionally, neither TNBS nor the different treatments caused significant changes in the relative weights of the main organs (% of total body weight), such as liver, kidneys and heart (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0174116.s001">S1 Table</xref></bold>) which are highly susceptible to drugs toxicity.</p>
<p>The intracolonic administration of TNBS in ethanol induced colonic inflammation which was eight days later characterized by several events, namely: i) severe necrosis of the mucosa, typically extending 4–6 cm along the colon; ii) bowel wall thickening; iii) colon shortening; iv) hyperemia; and v) focal adhesions to adjacent organs, according to the scale represented in <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0174116.t001">Table 1</xref></bold>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study was undertaken mainly to evaluate the potential use of an anthocyanin-rich fraction obtained from Portuguese blueberry fruits for the treatment of intestinal inflammation, in a TNBS induced colitis rat model, in comparison with 5-ASA, the standard therapy for most IBD patients. Our data confirmed the anti-inflammatory action previously reported to blueberry anthocyanins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref020">20</xref>] and showed, for the first time, that the protection afforded by this blueberry anthocyanin mixture in a colitis rat model was much more effective than that provided by 5-ASA, in similar experimental conditions.</p>
<p>The ARF used presented a high content and great variety of anthocyanins, which is in agreement with previously reported findings from different cultivars around the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref039">39</xref>]. However, the anthocyanin profile was somewhat different, with malvidin as the major class, instead of cyanidin, and malvidin-3-galactoside and petunidin-3-arabinoside in the highest concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174116.g001">Fig 1</xref>). It is worthy of note that these two anthocyanins have been detected in higher amounts than others in the ileostomy fluids of test patients after blueberries consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref040">40</xref>], suggesting their potential relevance in modulating the intestinal inflammatory process.</p>
<p>The results obtained in this rat model of colitis showed that either ARF (10 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>) or 5-ASA (100 mg.Kg<sup>-1</sup>) treatments counteracted the various signs of intestinal inflammation, including the very low rate of body weight gain, the colonic macroscopic damage score and the colon shortening, caused by TNBS (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174116.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174116.g003">3</xref>). Nonetheless, the ARF treatment showed better improvements than 5-ASA, despite the much lower molar dose of anthocyanins used, indicating its higher effectiveness.</p>
<p>The intestinal anti-inflammatory potential of the anthocyanin-rich fraction was also demonstrated by the reduction of active MPO and by the inhibition of ALP activity. MPO is abundantly expressed in primary granules of neutrophils, thus, tissue-associated MPO activity and expression can be used as a fundamental and reliable biochemical marker of leukocyte infiltration and of tissue recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref041">41</xref>]. In agreement with the macroscopic results previously referred, ARF treatment significantly reduced, and more efficiently than 5-ASA, MPO activity and its expression stimulated by TNBS-induced colitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174116.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). Similarly, in what concerns intestinal ALP activity, ARF treatment demonstrated a better efficacy than 5-ASA in reducing this TNBS-induced enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174116.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Currently, it is generally agreed that a tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase isoform is essentially expressed in the colon and is upregulated in response to inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref042">42</xref>]. Also, in the inflamed colon, both colonocytes and infiltrating leukocytes account for the increased ALP activity. Moreover, it is known that this ALP isoform is specifically upregulated by oxidative stimulus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref043">43</xref>]. Thus, since inflammation has been extensively associated with an increase in oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref037">37</xref>], the protection afforded by either anthocyanins or 5-ASA could be related to their well-known antioxidant properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref044">44</xref>].</p>
<p>On the other hand, TNBS-induced colitis has been associated with changes in antioxidant enzymes activity and in the levels of GSH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref045">45</xref>], the major intracellular redox buffer, and decreases in GSH/GSSG ratio have been correlated with the severity of mucosal inflammation in IBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref046">46</xref>]. Our data showed a strong reduction in the intestinal GSH/GSSG ratio in the TNBS-induced colitis group, by about 65% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174116.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), indicating a severe decrease in intestinal redox status. In agreement with this, the intestinal GPX activity decreased drastically in the same group, by about 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174116.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). The relevance of this enzyme in the cellular antioxidant defense machinery is well known, by reducing hydroperoxides with the parallel oxidation of GSH to GSSG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref016">16</xref>]. In this regard, the ARF treatment improved significantly either the GSH/GSSG ratio or the GPX activity in colon tissue, counteracting the TNBS-induced effects, in contrast with 5-ASA that did not significantly improve these oxidative stress markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174116.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). Thus, the higher beneficial effect of anthocyanins in alleviating the severity of TNBS-induced colitis may by related, in part, with the higher ability to strengthen colon antioxidant defenses.</p>
<p>Besides the increase in oxidative stress, the excessive production of pro-inflammatory mediators is a key player to the intestinal damage progression in IBD. Concerning such mediators, both iNOS and COX-2 enzymes seem to play a synergistic role in inflammation onset and severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref002">2</xref>]. Upregulation of these enzymes expression is known to be induced by activation of different signaling pathways, namely the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), whose expressions and activities have been reported to increase during intestinal inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref048">48</xref>]. This work demonstrated that the treatment with anthocyanins could counteract drastically the strong overexpression of both iNOS and COX-2 enzymes induced by TNBS, while 5-ASA only counteracted COX-2 overexpression. Actually, the strong inhibition of COX-2 expression seems to be a crucial common mechanism underlying the anti-inflammatory actions of 5-ASA and ARF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174116.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). This observation is highly relevant given that this inducible form of COX is known to be upregulated in the inflamed gut of IBD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref050">50</xref>], being a target for several drugs used in IBD, including 5-ASA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174116.ref051">51</xref>]. Regarding the effects on iNOS overexpression, the results obtained reinforced the much higher anti-inflammatory capacity of anthocyanins when compared to 5-ASA, as they inhibited almost completely the enzyme expression, in contrast with 5-ASA which did not show any significant effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174116.g007">Fig 7B</xref>) despite being used in a much higher molar dose than that of anthocyanins.</p>
<p><bold>In conclusion</bold>, our data show for the first time the stronger anti-inflammatory activity of an anthocyanin-rich fraction obtained from the blueberry <italic>Vaccinium corymbosum</italic> L., grown in Portugal, on TNBS-induced rat colitis, in comparison with 5-ASA, a reference anti-inflammatory drug in IBD. Such activity is complex, involving different mechanisms including decrease in leukocyte infiltration, increase in antioxidant defenses and downregulation of proinflammatory enzymes. The strong inhibition of colon COX-2 expression seems to be a crucial anti-inflammatory mechanism common to 5-ASA and ARF, but the additional higher ability of anthocyanins to downregulate iNOS and to decrease leukocytes infiltration and to increase antioxidant defenses in colon may account for the much higher anti-inflammatory action of ARF. Taken together, these results point to the efficacy of this anthocyanin mixture to counteract colitis severity and gather conditions to a faster recovery, being a contribution to the development of a promising natural therapeutic approach for intestinal inflammation.</p>
