<abstract>
<p>Homozygosity for <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> results in mice exhibiting orofacial abnormalities, alterations in carpal and rugae structures, hearing impairment and inflammation in the middle ear. In humans it has been hypothesised that the 2-oxoadipate mitochondrial carrier coded by <italic>SLC25A21</italic> may be involved in the disease 2-oxoadipate acidaemia. Unexpectedly, no 2-oxoadipate acidaemia-like symptoms were observed in animals homozygous for <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> despite confirmation that this allele reduces <italic>Slc25a21</italic> expression by 71.3%. To study the complete knockout, an allelic series was generated using the <italic>loxP</italic> and <italic>FRT</italic> sites typical of a Knockout Mouse Project allele. After removal of the critical exon and neomycin selection cassette, <italic>Slc25a21</italic> knockout mice homozygous for the <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1b(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> and <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1d(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> alleles were phenotypically indistinguishable from wild-type. This led us to explore the genomic environment of <italic>Slc25a21</italic> and to discover that expression of <italic>Pax9</italic>, located 3′ of the target gene, was reduced in homozygous <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> mice. We hypothesize that the presence of the selection cassette is the cause of the down regulation of <italic>Pax9</italic> observed. The phenotypes we observed in homozygous <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> mice were broadly consistent with a hypomorphic <italic>Pax9</italic> allele with the exception of otitis media and hearing impairment which may be a novel consequence of <italic>Pax9</italic> down regulation. We explore the ramifications associated with this particular targeted mutation and emphasise the need to interpret phenotypes taking into consideration all potential underlying genetic mechanisms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Knockout mice are invaluable tools for studying the function of genes both during embryonic development and in the adult. Classically, gene disruption in mice is achieved by replacing a part of the target gene with a selectable marker, e.g. a <italic>neo</italic> cassette, leading to constitutive ablation of the targeted gene. More contemporary approaches include the creation of conditional alleles and targeted gene traps, as well as small hairpin RNA (shRNA) and the use of lentiviral transgenesis, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-vanderWeyden1">[1]</xref>. The Sanger Institute Mouse Genetics Project <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-White1">[2]</xref> is contributing to an international effort to conduct systematic, large-scale gene function analysis in a mammalian system, through the generation of mice using targeted ES cells available from the EUCOMM and KOMP resources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Skarnes1">[3]</xref>. The typical EUCOMM and KOMP knockout first conditional ready targeted trap [tm1a(EUCOMM) and tm1a(KOMP)] is a powerful allele configured with the potential to convert to a conditional allele or a <italic>lacZ</italic> tagged null allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Skarnes1">[3]</xref>. This tm1a allele was selected for pragmatic reasons, including there being no requirement for additional breeding to modify the allele, as targeted traps typically disrupt expression of the targeted gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Skarnes1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Mitchell1">[4]</xref>, and the major advantage that the allele, with full potential for conversion, would be cryopreserved for subsequent community use. However, it has previously been reported that the presence of selectable markers used for gene targeting, such as the <italic>neo</italic> cassette in the EUCOMM and KOMP tm1a allele, can interfere with the expression of neighbouring genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Meier1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Pham1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Hug1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Fiering1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Olson1">[9]</xref>. It is, therefore, important that phenotypes discovered in mice carrying the knockout first conditional ready allele, are verified using the derived deletion allele.</p>
<p><italic>SLC25A21</italic> has previously been reported to be ubiquitously expressed in all tissues tested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Fiermonte1">[10]</xref>, and codes for the 2-oxoadipate mitochondrial carrier (ODC) that catalyses the movement of several substrates, primarily 2-oxoadipate and 2-oxoglutarate, across inner mitochondrial membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Fiermonte1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Palmieri1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Palmieri2">[12]</xref>. It is suspected that ODC functions by a counter exchange mechanism, catalysing the uptake of 2-oxoadipate into the mitochondrial matrix, in exchange for internal 2-oxoglutarate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Fiermonte1">[10]</xref>. The physiological role of the ODC suggests that it may be involved in the human disease 2-oxoadipate acidaemia (OMIM 204750), characterised by an accumulation of 2-oxoadipate and associated metabolites in urine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Palmieri1">[11]</xref>. This inborn error of metabolism shows clinical symptoms of intellectual disability varying from mild to severe, hypotonia, seizures, motor and developmental delay, and cerebellar ataxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Duran1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Fischer1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Przyrembel1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Wilson1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here we report characterization of the allelic series derived from the KOMP targeted allele of <italic>Slc25a21</italic>. From this, three distinct observations were made. Firstly, ablation of <italic>Slc25a21</italic> was not found to cause symptoms of 2-oxoadipate acidaemia in mice; animals homozygous for <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1b(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> and <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1d(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> null alleles were normal for all parameters tested. Secondly, we report that <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> homozygous mice present with profound dental, orofacial and hearing/middle ear phenotypes caused by off-target effects on the expression of the neighbouring gene <italic>Pax9</italic>. Finally, the resulting novel, hypomorphic allele of <italic>Pax9</italic> opens the door to further studies into how <italic>Pax9</italic> is involved in the patterning of the palatal rugae and may represent a novel model of otitis media in the mouse. With the growing resource of knockout first conditional ready targeted ES cells created by the EUCOMM and KOMP initiatives, these results represent a timely reminder that the phenotype observed in the knockout first conditional ready mice should be verified by creating and analysing the deletion allele.</p>

<title>Ethics Statement</title>
<p>The care and use of all mice in this study were in accordance with UK Home Office regulations, UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986, and were approved by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Ethical Review Committee. All efforts were made to minimize suffering including housing mice in a specific pathogen-free unit at a density of 3–5 animals per cage in polysulfone individually ventilated cages [Tecniplast Seal Safe 1284L (overall dimensions of caging: (L×W×H): 365×207×140 mm, floor area = 530 cm<sup>2</sup>)]. Sterilised Aspen bedding substrate and standard environmental enrichment of nestlet, cardboard tunnel, and three wooden chew blocks were provided. The light cycle was maintained at 12 h light/12 h dark with lights off at 19:30 hours and no twilight period. Room temperature was 21±2°C and humidity was regulated at 55±10%. Mice were given food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic> unless otherwise stated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-White1">[2]</xref>. Animal welfare is our primary consideration and was assessed routinely for all mice involved in this study. Adult mice were killed by terminal anaesthesia followed by exsanguination and either cervical dislocation or removal of the heart. Embryos were killed by decapitation or cooling followed by immersion in cold tissue fixative. Experimental work was performed in accordance with the Arrive guidelines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Kilkenny1">[17]</xref>.</p>

Cages were processed randomly and different genotypes could be housed together, hence there was no pattern to the order in which animals were processed. The experimental unit throughout the study was a single mouse.</p>
<p>Viability at postnatal day 14 was assessed from heterozygous (het) intercross matings. Furthermore, viability and embryo morphology for <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> mutant mice was assessed at E14.5 and E18.5.</p>

<p>Homozygous mice (7M and 7F) from each of the alleles (<italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic>, <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1b(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic>, <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1c(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> and <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1d(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic>), as well as age, sex and genetic background matched controls, were analysed using the standard Sanger Institute Mouse Genetics Project phenotyping screen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-White1">[2]</xref>. Assays of particular relevance are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0091807.s002">File S1</xref>, whilst those not part of the standard phenotyping screen are described below.</p>
<p>At necropsy, skulls were collected and the teeth (both upper and lower jaw) and palate were reviewed and imaged (MZ16A dissecting microscope, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany; DFC490 digital camera, Canon Powershot G5, Japan). A range of 42 additional tissues and organs from homozygous <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> mice (2M and 2F), and age, sex and genetic background matched controls, were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Leica Biosystems, Peterborough, UK) for 15–20 hrs and processed to wax. 5 µm sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin then reviewed by an experienced pathologist.</p>
<p>Micro-CT (computed tomography) images of skulls from <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> mice (wt, n = 2; hom, n = 2) were collected at 18 µm resolution (SkyScan 1176, SkyScan, Kontich, Belgium).</p>

<title>Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) recordings</title>
<p>ABRs were recorded in <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> mice aged 4 weeks (wt, n = 17; het, n = 27; hom, n = 7), 8 weeks (wt, n = 20; het, n = 33; hom, n = 8), 14 weeks (wt, n = 11; hom, n = 14), and 26 weeks (wt, n = 17; hom, n = 10), using the methods described in detail in Ingham et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Ingham1">[22]</xref>. In addition, mice from the <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1b(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> colony (hom, n = 8), <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1c(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> colony (hom, n = 5) and <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1d (KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> colony (hom, n = 8) were tested at 14 weeks of age.</p>
<p>Anaesthetised mice were placed on a heating blanket inside a sound attenuating booth and recording electrodes inserted in the skin to record responses of the left ear. For ABR threshold determination, click (0.01 ms duration) and tone pip (6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 kHz of 5 ms duration, 1 ms rise/fall time) stimuli over a range of intensity levels from 10–95 dB sound pressure level (SPL) in 5 dB steps were presented in free-field. Averaged responses to 256 stimuli, presented at 42.2/s, were analysed and thresholds established as the lowest sound intensity giving a visually-detectable ABR response.</p>

<p>Following ABR testing, <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> mice aged 9 weeks (wt, n = 8; het, n = 11; hom, n = 8) were killed by cervical dislocation and the right external and middle ears were examined in detail using a dissecting microscope for any signs of malformation or inflammation, including: appearance of excess cerumen in the external ear canal; thickening, whitening, sponginess or excess vascularisation of the bulla wall; clarity and vascularisation of the tympanic membrane; presence of fluid or white inflammatory material in the middle ear cavity; and solid masses or bony outgrowths of the middle ear wall or ossicles. In addition, the left side of the head of these mice was fixed in 10% formalin for 48 hours, and decalcified in 10% EDTA diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 10 days, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned at 8 µm and stained with haematoxylin and eosin.</p>

<title>Data analysis and statistics</title>
<p>A reference range approach was used to assess continuous data, including time course. For categorical data, a Fisher's exact test was used to identify phenotypic variants. More details of both approaches are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0091807.s002">File S1</xref>. Since both of the above approaches to automatically identify significant calls are known to be conservative and assess each parameter in isolation, they were complemented by a manual assessment made by a biological expert who used knowledge of events on the day, or across sexes, or between related variables, to highlight additional potentially abnormal phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0091807.s004">Table S2</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess the ABR data, a one-way Kruskall-Wallis ANOVA on Ranks was used where three genotypes were assessed and Mann-Whitney rank sum test where only homozygote and wild-type animals were assessed. The qPCR gene expression results for mutant mice were compared to littermate wild-type mice using a Student's t-Test assuming two-sample unequal variance. P-values for the RNA sequencing were adjusted for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Pre-weaning lethality was assessed using the Test for One Proportion.</p>

<p>Those homozygous animals surviving to weaning, presented with decreased body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091807-g001">Fig. 1A–B</xref>), fat mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091807-g001">Fig. 1C–D</xref>) and fat percentage estimate (data not shown), in both sexes, compared to wild-type controls. Furthermore, a range of dental abnormalities were observed in <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> homozygous mice. At 10 weeks of age 13 out of 14 homozygous <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> mice were found to have an abnormally shortened snout (data not shown). At 16 weeks of age all fourteen homozygous <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> mice were found to have macroscopically visible dental abnormalities ranging from white or translucent to severely hypoplastic lower incisors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091807-g002">Fig. 2A–B</xref>) compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091807-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). The molars of homozygous <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091807-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>), in particular of the lower jaw, were found to be strongly stained with X-gal (requiring β-galactosidase activity) compared to heterozygous and wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091807-g002">Fig. 2E–F</xref>). Microscopic examination of sections from representative animals confirmed that in unaffected areas, the molars were fully developed with normal odontoblast morphology. In affected areas of the molars, there was focal fracturing of the surface dentine and necrosis of the pulp with associated inflammation and bacterial colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091807-g002">Fig. 2G</xref>). Micro-CT scanning revealed that the lower incisor root area in homozygous <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> mice was severely under-developed and that the lower incisors appeared to be lacking the enamel coating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091807-g002">Fig. 2H–I</xref>) compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091807-g002">Fig. 2J</xref>). Furthermore, two dimensional X-ray images revealed several changes of the manidibular morphology including pronounced pogonion, pronounced anterior tuberosity, under-developed incisor process and alveolus (data not shown), potentially indicating a change in the developmental dynamics of the mandible in homozygous <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> mice.

<p>It has been proposed that loss of function of ODC, the protein encoded by <italic>SLC25A21</italic>, causes the human disease 2-oxoadipate acidaemia which is clinically characterised by hypotonia, seizures, motor and developmental delay, cerebellar ataxia and varying severities of intellectual disability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Duran1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Fischer1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Przyrembel1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Wilson1">[16]</xref>. Unexpectedly, homozygous <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> mice did not phenocopy this human disease. In particular, lean mass, grip strength and gait, correlates of the human disease manifestation, were all normal for these mice (data not shown), and no seizures were detected.</p>
<p>To ascertain the molecular consequence of the targeting event, expression analysis of <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> was performed on RNA extracted from embryo heads (E13.5). When using the <italic>Slc25a21</italic> TaqMan assay which spanned exons 8–9, 3′ of the cassette insertion, expression was found to be reduced in homozygous <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> samples (28.7% of wild-type expression, p = 2.0e-05) but not completely ablated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091807-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). The hypomorphic nature of this allele may have explained the absence of the predicted phenotypes, therefore an allelic series was created (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091807-g006">Fig. 6B–E</xref>) where tm1b was a <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter tagged deletion with the critical exon (exon 4) removed, tm1c a conditional allele with wild-type function restored, and tm1d the deletion allele where both exon 4 and the <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter were removed. Expression analysis of each of these <italic>Slc25a21</italic> alleles was performed on RNA extracted from embryo heads (E13.5). <italic>Slc25a21</italic> RNA expression was found to be ablated in homozygous <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1b(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> (0% of wild-type expression, expression was below the limit of detection) and greatly reduced in <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1d(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> homozygotes (12.9% of wild-type expression, p = 0.043) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091807-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). As expected, expression levels of <italic>Slc25a21</italic> in embryos homozygous for <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1c(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> were not significantly different from wild-type expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091807-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>).</p>

<p>These results led us to conclude that the phenotypes observed in mice homozygous for the <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> targeted allele were not due to ablation of Slc25a21 function, and speculate that off-target effects due to the selection cassette present in the tm1a allele affected expression of neighbouring genes.</p>

<title>Hypomorphic expression of <italic>Pax9</italic> may account for observed phenotypes</title>
<p>The 1 Mb genomic interval containing <italic>Slc25a21</italic> (500 kb flanking the target gene) is predicted to contain seven known protein coding genes, one non coding RNA, one novel antisense and one putative processed transcript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0091807.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Of particular interest is <italic>Pax9</italic>, located at the 3′ end of <italic>Slc25a21</italic> and orientated on the opposite strand. The 3′UTR regions of <italic>Slc25a21</italic> and <italic>Pax9</italic> overlap by 188 bp. Consistent with the phenotypes observed in <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> homozygous animals, mice carrying a hypomorphic <italic>Pax9</italic> allele had previously been reported as causing reduced viability at weaning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Kist1">[25]</xref>, and presented with a range of dental and craniofacial abnormalities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Kist1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Peters1">[26]</xref> similar to those described herein.</p>
<p>RNA expression analysis of <italic>Pax9</italic> was performed on embryo heads (E13.5) for all four alleles in the <italic>Slc25a21</italic> series. <italic>Pax9</italic> expression was found to be down regulated [approximately 34% of wild-type <italic>Pax9</italic> levels (p = 1.1E-06)] in homozygous <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091807-g008">Fig. 8</xref>) confirming our hypothesis that we had inadvertently created a <italic>Pax9</italic> hypomorphic allele. <italic>Pax9</italic> levels were found to be unaffected in homozygous <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1b(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic>, <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1c(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> and <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1d(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091807-g008">Fig. 8</xref>).

<p>RNA sequencing was performed to further explore the impact of the targeting event on the genomic environment around <italic>Slc25a21</italic>.

Subject to the sensitivity and scope of the phenotyping performed, ablation of <italic>Slc25a21</italic> expression was not found to phenocopy the human disease 2-oxoadipate acidaemia (OMIM 204750) for which it is a candidate gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Palmieri1">[11]</xref>. There are several possible explanations for this. Whilst no hypotonia, ataxia or seizures were detected in <italic>Slc25a21</italic> null mice [homozygous for the tm1b (KOMP)Wtsi or tm1d (KOMP)Wtsi alleles], a subset of other clinical symptoms associated with 2-oxoadipate acidaemia, including intellectual disability and urine metabolites, were not assessed by the standard Mouse Genetics Project primary phenotyping pipeline with which these animals were screened <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-White1">[2]</xref>. Therefore it cannot be ruled out that additional tests, or analysis performed with increased sensitivity, may reveal subtle disease similarities. Alternatively, mitochondrial transport of metabolites is a complex process involving many carrier proteins. Unknown compensatory mechanisms may be at play in <italic>Slc25a21</italic> null mice that prevent the cytoplasmic build-up of oxoadipate and the associated disruption in the catabolism of key amino acids such as lysine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Palmieri1">[11]</xref>. For example, it is known that the substrate specificity of Slc25a21 itself varies between species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Palmieri1">[11]</xref>. Finally, definitive proof of the candidacy of <italic>Slc25a21</italic> for 2-oxoadipate acidaemia is not published and it has been speculated that the disease may be due to defective 2-oxoadipate dehydrogenase, an alternative gene in the same metabolic pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Palmieri1">[11]</xref>.</p>

<title><italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> allele affects expression of a neighbouring gene</title>
<p>The <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> homozygous mice investigated in this study were found to be sub-viable. Those homozygous animals surviving to weaning presented with growth retardation, orofacial abnormalities, brittle, white incisors and hearing impairment. Given the absence of any detectable phenotype in mice homozygous for the <italic>Slc25a21</italic> tm1b (KOMP)Wtsi, tm1c (KOMP)Wtsi or tm1d (KOMP)Wtsi derived alleles, we conclude that the phenotypes observed in mice homozygous for <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> were not due to ablation of <italic>Slc25a21</italic> function, and propose that off-target effects of the tm1a allele affected expression of a neighbouring gene. The spatial, temporal and quantitatively correct activity of a gene requires the presence of not only intact coding sequence but also properly functioning regulatory control.

<p>At E13.5, RNA sequencing revealed that the only gene within the 1 Mb genomic interval surrounding <italic>Slc25a21</italic> that was differentially expressed, compared to wild-type, in homozygous <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> embryos was <italic>Pax9</italic>, an observation confirmed by quantitative PCR. <italic>Pax9</italic> is located in a 21.06 kb genomic interval directly 3′ of <italic>Slc25a21</italic> and orientated on the opposite strand. Evolutionarily conserved non-coding sequences are present both up-and down-stream of <italic>Pax9</italic>, some of which have been demonstrated to induce <italic>Pax9</italic> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Santagati1">[21]</xref>. One such conserved region, CNS+6, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Santagati1">[21]</xref> was located within the homology arm of the <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> targeting construct, and therefore a candidate for causing altered <italic>Pax9</italic> expression. However, sequencing confirmed the integrity of CNS+6 in the <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> allele. Since homozygous <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1b(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> mice, which still have part of the targeting cassette present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091807-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>), were found to be phenotypically normal, interference by the polyA-<italic>β-actin::neo</italic> cassette is the most likely cause of the reduction of <italic>Pax9</italic> expression seen in homozygous <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> mice. The findings in this study highlight the need to confirm phenotypes found in animals carrying the knockout first conditional ready [tm1a (KOMP)Wtsi or tm1a (EUCOMM)Wtsi] allele by creating and analysing the derived deletion allele. This is a timely reminder, with direct implications on the 3Rs, given the growing resource of knockout first conditional ready targeted ES cells created by the EUCOMM and KOMP initiatives.</p>

<title>Hypomorphic expression of <italic>Pax9</italic> may account for orofacial abnormalities</title>
<p>The <italic>Pax</italic> family of transcription factors plays a pivotal role in embryonic patterning and disease. The expression of each <italic>Pax</italic> gene is highly regulated in a temporal and spatial manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Lang1">[30]</xref>. During mouse embryogenesis, <italic>Pax9</italic> is expressed mainly in the sclerotome of somites, the pharyngeal pouch endoderm and its derivatives, developing limb buds, and in facial mesenchyme of neural-crest cell origin, including nasal and jaw processes and tooth buds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Peters1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Neubuser1">[31]</xref>. There is strong expression of <italic>Pax9</italic> in the medial edge epithelium during the critical time points of palate fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Sasaki1">[32]</xref>. In adult mice, <italic>Pax9</italic> is expressed in oesophagus and tongue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Peters2">[33]</xref>. Looking at published models of <italic>Pax9</italic> deficiency, homozygous <italic>Pax9</italic> knockout mice die shortly after birth and exhibit a wide range of developmental defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Peters1">[26]</xref> including the absence of teeth. Death has been attributed to cleft palate, affecting the maxillary and palatine shelves, resulting in an inability to suckle and respiratory issues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Peters1">[26]</xref>. Two hypomorphic alleles of <italic>Pax9</italic> have been published previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Kist1">[25]</xref>. The first, which expressed wild-type <italic>Pax9</italic> mRNA at 7% of control levels, presented with hypoplastic upper incisors lacking enamel, missing lower incisors, unilateral or bilateral absence of the third molar in the upper jaw and the second and third molar in the lower jaw, and the lower molars that were present showed severe attrition. In comparison, the hypomorphic allele with 20% of wild-type <italic>Pax9</italic> mRNA expression relative to controls presented with less severely affected dentition including relatively normal upper incisors, hypoplastic lower incisors lacking enamel and unilateral or bilateral absence of the upper and lower third molar. We now report homozygous <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> mice which express wild-type <italic>Pax9</italic> mRNA at 34% of control levels and present with an even milder dental phenotype including upper incisors that were commonly maloccluded, which may be due to abnormal snout morphology or the fact that the incisors do not wear against each other. We found fragile, damaged or missing lower incisors which were white or translucent; normally incisors in mice are brownish/yellow due to incorporation of iron-containing pigment in the enamel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Mataki1">[34]</xref>. The lower incisor root area was severely under-developed. Lower jaw molars showed focal fracturing of the surface dentine and necrosis of the pulp with associated inflammation and bacterial accumulation. The presence of <italic>lacZ</italic> activity within the cavities of the lower molars of homozygous <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> mice but not heterozygous mice, confirms that bacterial β-galactosidase is the cause of the staining, not expression of the lacZ reporter gene within the targeted allele. Molars in the upper jaw were less affected. The more severe findings in the lower jaw are consistent with findings in the other <italic>Pax9</italic> hypomorphic alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Kist1">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>Only limited assessment of the palate has been published for the previous <italic>Pax9</italic> hypomorphic lines and no abnormalities were reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Kist1">[25]</xref>. In this study, more extensive analysis was performed and whilst the phenotype was significantly less severe than that reported in <italic>Pax9</italic> null mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Peters1">[26]</xref>, abnormalities were identified, characterised largely by discordance of rugae 3 and an incomplete fusion of the vomer bone to the maxilla.</p>
<p>This gradated allelic series of <italic>Pax9</italic> expression levels, extended by the data reported herein, clearly demonstrates that dosage of this gene affects orofacial development and that lower jaw dentition in the mouse is more susceptible to reduced <italic>Pax9</italic> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Kist1">[25]</xref>.

<title>Otitis media and hearing impairment in mice may be due to disrupted <italic>Pax9</italic> expression</title>
<p>A reduction in the size of the tympanic ring has previously been described in Pax9 mutant mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Peters1">[26]</xref>, however the effect on hearing has not previously been assessed. The homozygous <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> mice have a normal sized tympanic ring but display a clear hearing impairment with increased thresholds at all frequencies tested. The moderate hearing impairment seen in homozygous <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> mice is robust and reproducible across different cohorts of mice, tested at ages from 4 to 26 weeks of age. The degree of impairment in mutant mice is progressive from 4–14 weeks old, with slower progression to 26 weeks of age. The parallel shifts in audiometric profiles across frequencies at the different ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091807-g004">Fig. 4</xref>) are consistent with an underlying conductive hearing loss. Middle ears of the majority of homozygous <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> mice were filled with fluid of varying viscosity at all ages examined and sections revealed inflammation of the lining of the middle ear. The presence of eosinophilic exudate and the thickening of the mucosa are evident in the homozygous <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> mice, indicating an on-going inflammatory process. Whilst the aetiology of otitis media is complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091807-Tyrer1">[38]</xref> and was beyond the scope of this study, the correlation between signs of otitis media and elevated ABR thresholds supports our suggestion that the otitis media is a major contributor to the hearing impairment observed in the young adult homozygous <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> mice. However, cochlear dysfunction cannot be ruled out especially in the 26 week-old group of both mutants and controls. ABR data from <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1b(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic>, <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1c(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> and <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1d(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> homozygotes indicate that hearing thresholds are normal.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, ablation of <italic>Slc25a21</italic> expression was not found to phenocopy the human disease 2-oxoadipate acidaemia (OMIM 204750) for which it is a candidate gene. The phenotypes observed in mice homozygous for <italic>Slc25a21<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic> were not due to ablation of <italic>Slc25a21</italic> function, but instead the presence of the selection cassette affected expression of the neighbouring gene, <italic>Pax9</italic>. The resulting mutant line confirmed and extended the existing knowledge of <italic>Pax9</italic> gene dosage effect on orofacial development and represents a novel model of otitis media that may be due to reduced <italic>Pax9</italic> expression.</p>
