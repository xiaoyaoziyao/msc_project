<abstract>
<p>Recent human adaptations have shaped population differentiation in genomic regions containing putative functional variants, mostly located in predicted regulatory elements. However, their actual functionalities and the underlying mechanism of recent adaptation remain poorly understood. In the current study, regions of genes and repeats were investigated for functionality depending on the degree of population differentiation, F<sub>ST</sub> or ΔDAF (a difference in derived allele frequency). The high F<sub>ST</sub> in the 5´ or 3´ untranslated regions (UTRs), in particular, confirmed that population differences arose mainly from differences in regulation. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses using lymphoblastoid cell lines indicated that the majority of the highly population-specific regions represented cis- and/or trans-eQTL. However, groups having the highest ΔDAFs did not necessarily have higher proportions of eQTL variants; in these groups, the patterns were complex, indicating recent intricate adaptations. The results indicated that East Asian (EAS) and European populations (EUR) experienced mutual selection pressures. The mean derived allele frequency of the high ΔDAF groups suggested that EAS and EUR underwent strong adaptation; however, the African population in Africa (AFR) experienced slight, yet broad, adaptation. The DAF distributions of variants in the gene regions showed clear selective pressure in each population, which implies the existence of more recent regulatory adaptations in cells other than lymphoblastoid cell lines. In-depth analysis of population-differentiated regions indicated that the coding gene, <italic>RNF135</italic>, represented a trans-regulation hotspot via cis-regulation by the population-specific variants in the region of selective sweep. Together, the results provide strong evidence of actual intricate adaptation of human populations via regulatory manipulation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recent large-scale human genome studies have revealed that all human beings share an almost identical genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref004">4</xref>]; however, minor differences among human populations exist as a result of genetic drift and adaptation. Using the genotyping data from the HapMap consortium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref005">5</xref>], genome-wide F<sub>ST</sub> estimates and a composite method involving F<sub>ST</sub> have been used to identify genes under selection pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref008">8</xref>]. It was found that genic regions harbored higher proportions of highly differentiated variants than non-genic regions, indicating selection pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref009">9</xref>]. Recent studies indicated that classic selective sweeps were rare in the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref011">11</xref>]; however, analysis of the 1000 Genomes Project Data identified many genes under positive selection using the composite method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref012">12</xref>]. More recent efforts to identify classic selective sweeps were successful in ascertaining a considerable number of genes under hard selective sweeps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref014">14</xref>], using differences in derived allele frequencies (ΔDAF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref015">15</xref>] and two methods that were robust against background selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>A region exhibiting a selective sweep suggests the presence of a local functional variant. This association has been demonstrated via the relationship between gene expression levels and variants showing selection signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref018">18</xref>]. Based on the composite method for the genome-wide scan, the identified regions under selection pressure were suggested to be likely involved in the regulation of gene expression, with a small number of nonsynonymous variants and many variants in the putative regulatory regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref012">12</xref>]. A more recent study evaluated the putative functionality of the population-differentiated regions based on ΔDAF and found that these regions were enriched with genic sites, especially transcription factor-binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref013">13</xref>]. Despite the strong evidence that the population-differentiated regions under positive selection are regulatory elements, these recent studies failed to find evidence of relationships between the identified regions and eQTLs, probably because the eQTL analyses were underpowered due to tissue specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>For the population-specific variants, separate eQTL analyses of each population would fail to identify eQTLs as the derived alleles of target variants are rare in one population and almost fixed in another. Therefore, it is important to perform eQTL analyses in combined populations, assuming that the functional variants affect both populations equally. Accordingly, the patterns in population differences and their functionalities were reinvestigated using whole-genome sequencing data from the 1000 Genomes Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref004">4</xref>]. Two population datasets of African descent in Africa (AFR) and of European descent (EUR) were chosen for the availability of their RNA-sequencing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref019">19</xref>]. These two datasets were examined intensively, and a population of East Asian descent (EAS) was used for comparison. Among the various available estimators of genetic population differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref023">23</xref>], the traditional F<sub>ST</sub> statistic and ΔDAF were respectively chosen in the current study to examine the detailed, region-based population differences at a genome-wide scale and to understand their relationship with functional variants.</p>

<title>Genome-wide F<sub>ST</sub> estimations based on sequencing data from the 1000 Genomes Project</title>
<p>Sequencing data from the 1000 Genomes Project were used for estimation of F<sub>ST</sub>. Among various populations, three populations of African ancestry (AFR), East Asian ancestry (EAS), and European ancestry (EUR) were selected for analyses. In AFR, only Africans residing in Africa were included in the current study; therefore, the populations of African ancestry in the Southwest US (ASW) and the African Caribbeans in Barbados (ACB) were excluded. The final numbers were 504 for AFR, 504 for EAS, and 503 for EUR. Whole-genome sequencing data for 22 autosomal chromosomes were examined in the current study.</p>
<p>The Hudson estimator of F<sub>ST</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref024">24</xref>] with bias corrections was used for genome-wide F<sub>ST</sub> estimations as suggested in the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref020">20</xref>]; the ratios of averages were applied to the F<sub>ST</sub> estimates of a certain genomic range as recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref020">20</xref>]. Multi-allele variants were divided into multiple variants depending on each allele. For the genome-wide estimates, two different ranges of 1,000 bp and 10,000 bp were used to compare distributions. The start site and the end site were based on the multiples of 1,000 bp or 10,000 bp, and the remnants were excluded from the estimations. Therefore, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0165870.t001">Table 1</xref>, the number of total variants of the genome-wide estimation based on the 10,000 bp range was smaller than the total number of variants (81,451,971). When examining the derived allele frequencies (DAFs), ancestral alleles that were determined only when all methods provided concordant results were applied from a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref025">25</xref>].</p>

<p>The gene-based F<sub>ST</sub> analyses were performed in two ways: 1) analyses of each gene and 2) whole genome-wide analyses as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0165870.t001">Table 1</xref>. For genome-wide analyses, each region of the 5´ UTR, coding sequences (CDS), 3´ UTR, noncoding gene regions, and introns was examined separately based on ENSEMBL perl API [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref026">26</xref>]. Additional regions near the gene were also examined: from −5,000 bp to the gene start site, from −1,000 bp to the gene start site, from the gene end site to +1,000 bp, and from the gene end site to +5,000 bp. When there were several transcripts or genes in the same region, priorities were assigned depending on the following order: 1) CDS; 2) 5´ UTR; 3) 3´ UTR; 4) noncoding gene regions; 5) intron; 6) the region between -1,000 bp and the gene start site; 7) the region between +1,000 bp and the gene end site; 8) the region between -5,000 bp and the gene start site; and 9) the region between +5,000 bp and the gene end site. For example, if a genomic region contained an intron of one gene and a 5´ UTR of another gene, the genomic region was considered a 5´ UTR. For repeats and non-repeats, the repeat regions were defined as genomic regions containing at least one repeat sequence, and non-repeat regions as the remainder of genomic sequences containing no repeat sequences.</p>

<title>Simulations</title>
<p>Simulations were performed based on the forward simulations of the Wright-Fisher model, as reported in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref025">25</xref>]. To examine the differences between the divided populations, the randomly mating original population, with a population size of N, was divided into two populations, each of size N/2. To perform division at the equilibrium state, the original population was randomly mated for 8N generations before division. After division, no migration was assumed and each randomly mating population gradually increased in size from N/2 to N, at a rate of one individual per generation, for N/2 generations. After the restoration of the population size to that of the original population, each population underwent random mating for 4N generations. For the simulations, constant mutation and recombination rates were assumed as 10<sup>−7</sup>/bp per generation. When the population size was 200, a 2,000,000 bp sequence was simulated 10 times in parallel; however, when the population size was 400, a 1,000,000 bp sequence was simulated 20 times in parallel, due to computational limitations.</p>

<title>eQTL analyses</title>
<p>RNA sequencing data of lymphoblastoid cell lines from a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref019">19</xref>] were used for the current analyses. Data were obtained from a total of 465 individuals comprising Utah residents with Northern and Western European ancestry (CEU), Toscani in Italy (TSI), British in England and Scotland (GBR), Finnish in Finland (FIN), and Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI). The final data set of RNA sequencing retained 462 individuals after quantification and normalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref019">19</xref>]. By excluding individuals not found in the Phase 3 sequencing data of the 1000 Genomes Project, eQTL analyses in the current study were conducted for 445 individuals. The previous study divided the samples into Europeans (a total of 373 individuals) and YRI (a total of 89 individuals) to provide two different eQTL results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref019">19</xref>]; however, to obtain population-wide functional variants, the current study analyzed all of the samples collectively, thereby providing new results with improved power. In accordance with the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref019">19</xref>], variants with a minor allele frequency higher than 0.05 were analyzed.</p>
<p>For eQTL analyses, Matrix eQTL, an R package, was used as in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref027">27</xref>]. Since population-specific expression might exist regardless of the individual genotype, the linear model with a covariate was used to adjust the inherent population specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref027">27</xref>]. For the regions with the highest F<sub>ST</sub> estimates, the following four different quantitative traits were analyzed for their relation to genotypes: gene expression, exon expression, repeat expression, and transcription ratios; however, gene expression analyses were conducted for ΔDAF variants, considering the priority and similarity between results for different quantitative traits. For the definition of cis- and trans-eQTL, the default setting of the program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref027">27</xref>] was applied, in which cis-eQTL was taken as a significant correlation between a variant and a transcript located within a 10<sup>6</sup> bp range of the variant position. The cut-off p-value of the trans-eQTL was 0.01, and the cut-off p-value of the cis-eQTL was 0.05. The cut-off for the false discovery rate was 0.05 in the current study.</p>

<title>Genome-wide F<sub>ST</sub> estimation</title>
<p>To identify population-specific regions within the genome, the genome-wide F<sub>ST</sub> estimates were examined in three populations: AFR, EUR, and EAS. Based on a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref020">20</xref>], which enabled the estimation of F<sub>ST</sub> for a certain range, including rare variants, the current study examined the F<sub>ST</sub> estimates of two different ranges: 10,000 bp and 1,000 bp. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165870.g001">Fig 1</xref>, the distribution of F<sub>ST</sub> estimates differed depending on the range examined. As the estimating range decreased, the distribution of F<sub>ST</sub> estimates became more dispersed, as smaller numbers of variants in the regions resulted in more diverse F<sub>ST</sub> estimates. The bias correction term suggested by the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref020">20</xref>] resulted in many estimates with negative values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165870.g001">Fig 1</xref>), especially for regions with only small numbers of rare variants.</p>

<p>More variants existed in AFR, and the F<sub>ST</sub> distributions for AFR showed higher degrees of freedom if considered as chi-squared distributions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref022">22</xref>]. For the F<sub>ST</sub> between AFR and EUR, the population-specific regions of the highest 1% of F<sub>ST</sub> estimates contained many genes (1,220 and 5,730 for the 10,000 bp and 1,000 bp, respectively). However, the number of genes in these regions with the highest 1% of the total F<sub>ST</sub> estimates was less than the number of genes in the least population-specific region (bottom 1% of total F<sub>ST</sub> estimates; 1,359 and 11,574 for 10,000 bp and 1,000 bp regions, respectively). These results indicate that genes are preferentially located in the least population-specific regions.</p>
<p>Simulation results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165870.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) showed distributions similar to those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165870.g001">Fig 1</xref>, which appear similar to a chi-squared distribution as previously predicted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref022">22</xref>]. The simulations reflected the original population and no sampling of the population was performed; therefore, bias corrections were omitted, providing no F<sub>ST</sub> estimates below zero. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165870.g001">Fig 1</xref>, the F<sub>ST</sub> distribution was more dispersed as the estimating range became smaller. For the same mutation and recombination rates of 10<sup>−7</sup>, the mean of the total F<sub>ST</sub> estimates decreased with increasing population size, resulting in slower population differentiation. The means of the F<sub>ST</sub> estimates were 0.29 and 0.25 for population sizes of 200 and 400, respectively, when the estimating range was 10,000 bp. Similarly, the means were 0.14 and 0.13, respectively, when the range was 1,000. As expected, as the mutation and recombination rates increased, the F<sub>ST</sub> estimates increased rapidly under the same conditions. The exact relationship between population size and F<sub>ST</sub> estimates requires further studies.</p>
<p>Considering the importance and variability of structural variants in the genome, the F<sub>ST</sub> between AFR and EUR was estimated for each structural variant (a total of 38,336) including copy number variants, large deletions or insertions, and inversions as provided by the 1000 Genomes Project. As expected, most structural variants were rare in both populations, and the F<sub>ST</sub> distribution skewed toward zero. Many structural variants were large enough to involve genes and were therefore likely to be deleterious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref028">28</xref>], preventing an increase in their frequency in both populations. The top 1% of F<sub>ST</sub> structural variants were copy number deletions, which represented the most common structural variant. The total F<sub>ST</sub> estimate of all structural variants was 0.094. The maximum F<sub>ST</sub> between AFR and EUR in the current study was 0.508 for a copy number deletion in chromosome 2, harboring <italic>ANKRD36</italic>, followed by 0.494 for a copy number deletion in chromosome 15 harboring <italic>MYO9A</italic>, and 0.472 for a copy number deletion in chromosome 4 harboring <italic>PDLIM3</italic>.</p>

<title>F<sub>ST</sub> estimates of genes and repeats</title>
<p>F<sub>ST</sub> was estimated for each gene in the human genome registered in ENSEMBL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref026">26</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165870.s002">S2 Fig</xref>, the distribution of F<sub>ST</sub> estimates for noncoding genes was more dispersed than that for the coding genes, with a longer tail, because the sizes of noncoding genes were more diverse with many genes smaller than coding genes. Therefore, the highest F<sub>ST</sub> estimates of total genes mostly represented noncoding genes rather than coding genes. The highest F<sub>ST</sub> estimates of noncoding genes were derived from only one or two population-specific variants within the gene region. For the regions of coding and noncoding genes with the highest F<sub>ST</sub> estimates, the population with the higher allele frequency of the population-specific variants (mostly AFR) usually represented more variants with common frequencies in the extended regions (±5,000 bp of the start and the end sites of the target gene) as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165870.s003">S3 Fig</xref>. The extended regions also exhibited strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) through D’, and some regions showed strong LD through r<sup>2</sup> between many variants in the target region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165870.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). The data for EAS behaved in accordance to the population with which it shared similarity depending on the population-specific allele examined. DAFs were often almost fixed in the EUR and EAS populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165870.s005">S5 Fig</xref>), similar to a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Eleven of the top 1% of coding genes (a total of 181) were concordant with the gene list (a total of 55) of a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref006">6</xref>] based on the F<sub>ST</sub> estimate of each genotyped variant, which included <italic>SLC24A5</italic>, associated with skin pigmentation, and <italic>EXOC5</italic> and <italic>RNF135</italic>, the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> topmost genes, respectively. Many coding genes with the highest F<sub>ST</sub> estimates were much larger than the topmost noncoding genes, and therefore included numerous population-specific variants within the gene region. For the relatively large genes, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165870.s003">S3B Fig</xref>, many population-specific variants showed similar or identical frequencies in the gene region, and these variants were also in strong LD through r<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165870.s004">S4B Fig</xref>), suggesting strong selection pressure.</p>
<p>When the overall genome-wide F<sub>ST</sub> estimates were examined, the gene regions showed higher F<sub>ST</sub> estimates than the non-genic regions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0165870.t001">Table 1</xref>), consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref009">9</xref>]. Among the various gene components, the highest F<sub>ST</sub> estimate for AFR vs. EUR was obtained for the 3´ UTRs and the highest F<sub>ST</sub> estimates for AFR vs. EAS and EAS vs. EUR were obtained for the 5´ UTRs. In addition, the F<sub>ST</sub> estimates of the CDS were relatively smaller than those for the total gene regions. These results indicated that the population differences were mostly based on regulation of gene expression rather than on the gene products themselves. However, the regions between ±1,000 bp (or ±5,000 bp) and the gene start (or end) sites showed lower F<sub>ST</sub> estimates than the gene regions themselves. It is noteworthy that the F<sub>ST</sub> estimates for EAS were extraordinarily high for the 5´ UTRs, suggesting that the 5´ UTRs of many coding genes were highly differentiated in EAS.</p>
<p>Regions containing repeats undergo evolutionary processes different from those of non-repeat regions. Variants within repeats have been found to experience more rapid evolutionary change than those in non-repeat regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref030">30</xref>]; therefore, F<sub>ST</sub> estimates of repeat regions might be higher than those of non-repeat regions, if the variants are neutral. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0165870.t001">Table 1</xref>, the total repeat region, throughout the whole genome, showed a slightly smaller F<sub>ST</sub> estimate of 0.130 compared to the value of 0.131 obtained for the total non-repeat region. The same trend was observed for F<sub>ST</sub> estimates for other populations, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0165870.t001">Table 1</xref>. The distribution of F<sub>ST</sub> estimates also showed a slightly longer tail for the non-repeat regions, although the longer tail resulted from a single high F<sub>ST</sub> estimate of a specific non-repeat region. The regions of repeats and non-repeats with the highest F<sub>ST</sub> estimates showed allele frequency distributions, LD plots, and DAF distributions similar to those of genes with the highest F<sub>ST</sub> estimates.</p>

<title>eQTL analyses of population-specific genes and variants</title>
<p>The functionalities of regions with the highest and lowest F<sub>ST</sub> estimates were examined using RNA sequencing data, generated in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref019">19</xref>], for lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from individuals participating in the 1000 Genomes Project. The regions with the highest F<sub>ST</sub> estimates for four genomic categories, i.e., repeats, non-repeats, noncoding genes, and coding genes, were examined. To examine whether the highest F<sub>ST</sub> regions were likely eQTLs, the proportions of regions with at least one eQTL, defined by a false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05, were examined. For coding and noncoding genes, the variants were analyzed in the regions with the highest and lowest 1% of the F<sub>ST</sub> estimates; for repeat and non-repeat regions, the variants were analyzed in the regions with the highest and lowest 100 F<sub>ST</sub> estimates.</p>
<p>The highest F<sub>ST</sub> regions contained overwhelming proportions of eQTL regions compared to the lowest F<sub>ST</sub> regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165870.s006">S6 Fig</xref>), most of which contained only rare variants. Because the eQTL analyses were conducted for variants with minor allele frequencies &gt; 0.05, most of the regions with the lowest F<sub>ST</sub> did not consist of variants to be analyzed, as indicated previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref013">13</xref>]. Even when only the regions with the lowest F<sub>ST</sub> that had variants for eQTL analyses were included, the trend that the regions with the highest F<sub>ST</sub> were still more likely to consist of eQTLs did not change, except for a few repeat cis-eQTLs. Repeats had trends that were similar to those of non-repeats, and coding genes had trends that were similar to those of noncoding genes, with a higher proportion of exon cis-eQTLs than exon trans-eQTLs. Accepting the concerns described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref013">13</xref>], the regions with lengths that were matched to the genes with the highest 1% of F<sub>ST</sub> genes were examined as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165870.g002">Fig 2</xref>. The regions with the highest F<sub>ST</sub> clearly were more likely to be eQTL when compared to the regions with matched lengths, showing significant p-values through simple chi-squared tests (most p-values &lt; 0.001), except for the proportions of repeat cis-eQTLs. These results indicated that the genes with the top F<sub>ST</sub> likely included eQTLs.</p>

<p>For the top ten regions, many population-specific variants were classified as eQTL with FDR &lt; 0.05 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165870.s010">S1 Table</xref>); many were also both cis- and trans-eQTLs. Notably, population-specific variants in repeats or non-repeats with the highest F<sub>st</sub> estimates tended to regulate repeat expression rather than gene expression, and noncoding and coding genes tended to regulate gene rather than repeat expression. Several population-specific variants in repeats and non-repeats were found to be eQTL hotspots, regulating many genes simultaneously (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165870.s010">S1 Table</xref>). Several population-specific variants in noncoding genes were also eQTL hotspots, and most of the population-specific coding genes were strong cis- and trans-eQTLs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165870.s010">S1 Table</xref>). Especially, most population-specific variants with similar allele frequencies in these genes were also identified as eQTLs, which substantially increased the number of eQTLs with FDR &lt;0.05. The evidence of strong population-specific regulator variants suggested the importance of these genes in determining the phenotypic differences between AFR and EUR.</p>
<p>Among the population-specific genes that were also eQTLs, one coding gene (<italic>RNF135</italic>) and one noncoding gene (<italic>RN7SL138P</italic>) were located close to each other on the <italic>NF1</italic> microdeletion region of chromosome 17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref031">31</xref>]. The extended region from –10,000 bp from the start site of <italic>RN7SL138P</italic> to +10,000 bp from the end site of <italic>RNF135</italic> was therefore examined in depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165870.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Consistent with the findings for allele frequency distributions of the extended regions of each gene, more variants with high frequencies were observed in AFR than in EUR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165870.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), possibly due to the reference genome. The entire region was in strong LD through both D’ and r<sup>2</sup>, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165870.g003">Fig 3B</xref>; however, the LD was strongest in EAS and stronger in EUR than in AFR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165870.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, most population-specific variants in this region regulated the expression of <italic>RNF135</italic>, indicating that the strong cis-eQTL resulted from this regulation. Furthermore, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165870.g003">Fig 3D</xref>, most variants in strong LD with each other in the region were also strong trans-regulators. Therefore, in this region, the gene product of <italic>RNF135</italic> most likely acted as a trans-regulator to control the expression of many other genes at distant loci via a cis activation. To summarize, one or several population-specific variants in this region regulate the expression of <italic>RNF135</italic>, and, in turn, the gene product of <italic>RNF135</italic> regulates other genes at distant loci.</p>

<p>One variant (rs113617171) in the region showed an extraordinarily large number of trans-eQTLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165870.g003">Fig 3C</xref>); however, the number of eQTLs with FDR &lt;0.05 was not high compared with other variants. Most gene enrichment analyses using gene ontology failed to produce a meaningful biological process that was enriched in the gene lists; however, the gene list obtained from rs113617171 showed significant p-values for the following enriched biological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref033">33</xref>]: RNA splicing (1.8 × 10<sup>−2</sup>), chromatin organization (2.3 × 10<sup>−4</sup>), organelle organization (6.14 × 10<sup>−4</sup>), cellular component organization (2.48 × 10<sup>−2</sup>), protein metabolic process (5.89 × 10<sup>−3</sup>), metabolic process (9.66 × 10<sup>−8</sup>), and primary metabolic process (3.04 × 10<sup>−5</sup>), in the order of fold enrichment. The biological processes that showed fewer numbers of expected genes were as follows: developmental process (3.82 × 10<sup>−2</sup>), system development (2.98 × 10<sup>−4</sup>), ectoderm development (1.42 × 10<sup>−2</sup>), and nervous system development (5.27 × 10<sup>−5</sup>). The Bonferroni correction was applied to all of the results.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165870.g003">Fig 3E</xref>, most of the high-frequency alleles in AFR shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165870.g003">Fig 3A</xref> were ancestral alleles, and many derived alleles were almost fixed in EAS and EUR; both EAS and EUR contained small numbers of common variants. This result suggests a recent selective sweep in the region of chromosome 17 harboring <italic>RN7SL138P</italic> and <italic>RNF135</italic>, which was also a strong cis- and trans-regulator as described above. As previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref018">18</xref>], a bottleneck and exposure to new environment could explain the reason why EAS and EUR were primarily affected by the selective sweep representing extreme population differences in the region; however, the allele frequency distribution and strong LD indicated the possibility that AFR had also experienced selection pressure. A recent study found that a missense variant (rs111902263) in <italic>RNF135</italic> was associated with autism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref034">34</xref>]; however, although the accuracy problem of detecting ancestral alleles exists, the derived allele frequencies of the variant were very low (0.002, 0.027, and 0 for AFR, EUR, and EAS, respectively), indicating this variant might not be the driver.</p>

<title>Relationship between ΔDAF and eQTLs</title>
<p>The F<sub>ST</sub> estimates of certain regions were dependent on the length of the estimated regions based on simulation studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165870.s001">S1 Fig</xref>); therefore, the attempts to determine an overall connection between eQTLs and population differentiation based on gene-based F<sub>ST</sub> estimates results in a false relationship due to the intrinsic dependency of eQTLs on the lengths. However, single-variant analyses could provide no such correlation regarding the impact of functional variants on population differentiation. The F<sub>ST</sub> estimate of each single variant could be applicable; however, for simplicity, ΔDAF was examined in the current study, especially for the ΔDAFs of all variants in coding and noncoding genes. As variants with minor allele frequencies higher than 0.05 in the data were included in the eQTL analyses, the ΔDAFs of these variants were examined. In total, 2,895,539 variants in coding genes and 1,071,250 variants in noncoding genes were included.</p>
<p>To examine the overall relationship between population differentiation and functionality, the variants were ordered and grouped based on ΔDAF, with each group consisting of 20,000 or 10,000 variants depending on the decreasing order of ΔDAF for coding or noncoding genes respectively. Therefore, there were 145 groups for 2,895,539 coding variants and 107 groups for 1,071,250 noncoding variants. The proportions of variants having eQTLs with FDR &lt; 0.05 in each group were plotted, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165870.g004">Fig 4</xref>. Assuming no influence of the eQTLs on population differentiation, random yet constant proportions were expected as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165870.g004">Fig 4A and 4C</xref> for cis-eQTLs, although a slight tendency to decrease was observed, especially in coding genes in this study. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165870.g004">Fig 4B and 4D</xref> for trans-eQTLs, high proportions in the groups with high ΔDAF between AFR and EUR (or EAS) indicated selection pressure acting on a specific population, and high proportions in the groups with low ΔDAF, specifically between EAS and EUR, indicated global selection pressure on both populations. The patterns of eQTL proportions grouped depending on the ΔDAF between AFR and EUR were similar to those between AFR and EAS and different from those between EAS and EUR. The patterns were very similar between coding and noncoding genes, but differed between cis-eQTLs and trans-eQTLs. The spikes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165870.g004">Fig 4</xref> were usually derived from one region containing many variants with similar DAFs, possibly due to selection pressures on broad regions.</p>

<p>The mean DAFs of functional variants depending on the ΔDAF groups showed larger mean DAFs in EAS and EUR among the most highly differentiated groups in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165870.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165870.s007">S7</xref>, indicating strong recent adaptations in these two populations.

<p>Notably, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165870.g004">Fig 4</xref>, the groups with the lowest ΔDAF between EAS and EUR showed very high proportions of trans-eQTLs, indicating common selective pressures in both EAS and EUR. The selective pressures were likely negative rather than positive because the mean DAF of EAS and EUR was low for the corresponding low ΔDAF groups between EAS and EUR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165870.g005">Fig 5C and 5F</xref>). Here, because the mean DAF of AFR was higher than the overall DAFs as well as the mean DAF of both EAS and EUR, the negative selection of the corresponding functional variants in EAS and EUR looks slightly positive or at least neutral in AFR. The slightly higher trans-eQTL proportions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165870.g004">Fig 4B and 4D</xref> in groups with the low, yet not the lowest, ΔDAF between AFR and EUR indicated common negative selective pressures on trans-eQTLs strongly in AFR and less strongly in EUR as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165870.g005">Fig 5A and 5D</xref>.</p>
<p>For neutral variants, the distribution of DAFs exhibited a very high density near zero, followed by rapid continuous decrement. Notably, the DAFs for all frequency variants in the gene regions showed unusual distributions (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165870.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165870.s008">S8</xref>). The DAF distributions of all three populations showed a slight bump near one, indicating the existence of functional variants under selective pressure close to fixation. The phenomena can be observed with false identifications of ancestral alleles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref025">25</xref>]; however, because the ancestral identifications based on the concordance of all three methods did not produce the phenomena in the previous study, the DAF distributions for gene regions clearly presented the existence of functional variants close to fixation. All three populations also showed a bump at specific points prior to 0.01 that differed depending on population. AFR showed the most distinctive peak, indicating many variants under ongoing selection pressure, whereas EAS showed a gentle slope almost buried at the starting peak. Overall, for all populations, the observations indicated that variants under selection pressure existed in gene regions, some of which were close to fixation, and others under very recent or weak selective pressure.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The unusual patterns of allele frequencies and strong LD of the topmost differentiated regions supported the existence of selective sweeps, as has been recently suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref014">14</xref>]. More importantly, the intricate relationship between the grouped ΔDAF and eQTLs conclusively indicated the complexities of recent human adaptation, mainly via regulatory manipulations. When the top 1% of coding genes in the current study were compared with the genes located in the top 1% of regions under classic selective sweeps in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref014">14</xref>], a few genes common to both lists were identified. The previous study did not highlight <italic>RNF135</italic> on chromosome 17 as a region of selective sweep, although this gene was included in the gene list under strong selection pressure in another study by the same group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref006">6</xref>]. Additionally, no genes of ancient selective sweeps from another recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref035">35</xref>] were found in the list of the highest 1% of coding genes in the current study, indicating that the selection pressure on the highly differentiated genes was possibly quite recent.</p>
<p>The method based on long-range haplotype did not find this <italic>RNF135</italic> region under selection pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref036">36</xref>]. However, 22 genes under positive selection discovered using the composite method were coincident with the highest 1% of coding genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref012">12</xref>]. Among the top ten coding genes in the current study, five genes (including <italic>RNF135</italic>) were also listed in the identified region using the composite method; however, <italic>RNF135</italic> was found to be under selection pressure only in the population from Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI) in this previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref012">12</xref>], although stronger selective sweeps occurred in EAS and EUR than in AFR, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165870.g003">Fig 3E</xref>. Only nine population-differentiated regions from the recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref013">13</xref>] were coincident with the highest 1% of coding genes, including <italic>CTXN2</italic> and <italic>ZMYM6</italic>, among the top ten coding genes. This discordance again indicated the difficulty in detecting selection pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref037">37</xref>], and improvements in identifying regions under selection pressure might be useful to resolve the remaining problems.</p>
<p>The F<sub>ST</sub> estimator suggested in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref020">20</xref>] showed reliable results in finding the population-specific regions of the human genome. However, the bias correction terms in the equation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref020">20</xref>] led to unrealistic F<sub>ST</sub> distributions with many negative estimates. Although the bias term approaches zero as the sample sizes increases, it may be preferable to reconsider the use of an unbiased F<sub>ST</sub> estimator, especially when the distribution of F<sub>ST</sub>, or small regions, is of interest. The distributions of F<sub>ST</sub> estimates differed depending on the range examined, when the simulations were performed assuming genetic drift for neutral regions. As the estimating range decreased, the smaller numbers of variants in the regions resulted in more diverse F<sub>ST</sub> estimates and finally more dispersed distribution of F<sub>ST</sub> estimates. Therefore, smaller genes were observed more frequently than larger genes in the groups with the highest and lowest F<sub>ST</sub> estimates, and larger genes were mostly observed in the group with mid-range F<sub>ST</sub> estimates. When the proportions of large genes (&gt; 10,000 bp in size) in F<sub>ST</sub> groups were plotted similarly to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165870.g004">Fig 4</xref>, a slight skew towards groups with high F<sub>ST</sub> was observed. Large population-specific genes under strong selective sweeps would harbor many population-specific variants with similar allele frequencies under strong LD, possibly representing overlapping eQTL signals.</p>
<p>There have been concerns on the use of F<sub>ST</sub> regarding their dependency on diversity within a population, and these concerns have lead to multiple other estimates that are also applicable to multi-allelic variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref038">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref041">41</xref>]. The concern was mainly due to the highly mutable and highly variable sites such as microsatellites. In the current study, the effect of within population diversity might not be critical because the main focus was on nucleotide subsitutions and insertions/deletions. Similarly, the V<sub>ST</sub> statistic, which is applicable to multi-allelic variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref042">42</xref>], was applied to structural variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref043">43</xref>]. The V<sub>ST</sub> statistic is specialized for structural variants based on the variance of the log<sub>2</sub> ratios in the identification of structural variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref042">42</xref>]. However, when identifying population-specific structural variants, each population-specific allele could be of interest as opposed to examining all of the alleles within the multi-allele variants. Therefore, the current study utilized the traditional F<sub>ST</sub> statistic rather than other statistics. Furthermore, structural variants exhibited smaller F<sub>ST</sub> estimates than other types of variants, which suggested that structural variants might not play a crucial role in population-specific phenotypes.</p>
<p>Regarding the DAF distributions for eQTLs, because the constitution of populations for eQTL variants involved mostly EUR, the DAF distributions were biased as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165870.s008">S8 Fig</xref>; this was also reflected in the DAF distributions of the eQTLs. Regardless of the intrinsic distortions due to confinement, the DAF distributions of eQTLs showed distinctive features compared to the DAF distributions of analyzed variants, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165870.g006">Fig 6</xref>. For EAS and EUR, the DAF distributions of the trans-eQTLs showed clear bumps near one, indicating almost fixed functional variants. For all populations, the DAF distributions of the cis-eQTLs showed slightly higher densities for the DAFs of common variants, indicating cis-regulating variants under selective pressure, which was also coincident with the slight negative correlations between groups with decreasing ΔDAF and the proportions of cis-eQTLs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165870.g004">Fig 4</xref>. In comparison with the unusual distribution of all DAFs in gene regions, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165870.g006">Fig 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165870.s008">S8 Fig</xref>, the DAF distributions of eQTLs likely indicate the existence of selection pressure on functional variants other than those underlying the eQTLs of the lymphoblastoid cell lines.</p>
<p>In the current study, the eQTL analyses were based on RNA sequencing of lymphoblastoid cell lines. The population-specific variants might show different results depending on the tissue examined due to tissue specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref044">44</xref>]. Recent epigenome analyses have demonstrated that population differences are not confined to the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref045">45</xref>], identifying regions wherein methylation patterns differed between populations in epidermis samples. It is questionable whether the differences arose from genetic differences, environment, or inherited methylation patterns. Further studies could elucidate the exact mechanisms underlying complex traits and their population differences in consideration of tissue specificity and various omics data.</p>
<p>Differential demographic changes in populations affect the allele frequency distributions, which also can influence the population differentiation estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref046">46</xref>]. The influence of the most recent demography is the largest, and the recent expansions have been observed for most human populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref047">47</xref>]. Therefore, the demographic influence could be similar in all studied populations. In addition, population structures exist even in populations in regions that are within close geographical proximity, which can influence any population-based associations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref049">49</xref>]. The current study employed the regional populations, including only individuals who had been residing in the region so as to minimize the effects of migration or population structure. The method of detecting selection pressures based on individuals rather than populations did not identify the <italic>RNF135</italic> region as the region under strong selection pressures, although the method is free from the false positives due to the population structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref048">48</xref>]. Removing these effects of demographic changes and population structure could be a solution, as provided previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref050">50</xref>].</p>
<p>Beyond genome-wide genotyping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref001">1</xref>] and whole-genome sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref002">2</xref>], the functionality of genetic regions or variants has received attention for better understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref019">19</xref>]. However, the contribution of rare variants to the manifestation of complex traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref051">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref053">53</xref>] makes the identification of rare functional variants and understanding of their underlying mechanisms challenging. Rare variants in one population may occasionally be common in another, and genetic differences between populations may provide valuable insights into the influence of rare functional variants. Furthermore, the elucidation of population differences is essential for realizing the promise of precision medicine, which is aimed at providing customized prevention and treatment to each individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165870.ref054">54</xref>].</p>
<p>To establish evidence of the functional roles of population differentiation, genome-wide F<sub>ST</sub> estimations, ΔDAFs and eQTL analyses of all variants in the gene regions were conducted in the current study. The suggested F<sub>ST</sub> statistic was useful for examining regions under population differentiation, and the eQTL analyses of highly differentiated regions indicated the importance of regulatory manipulations in population differentiation. To examine the relationship between functionality and population differentiation, ΔDAFs of whole variants in gene regions were grouped depending on their ΔDAFs. The analyses of ΔDAF groups showed complicated patterns of recent human adaptation through gene regulation, including strong adaptation common to EAS and EUR as well as mild or more recent adaptation in AFR. The current study provides the first actual evidence of intricate recent human adaptations. Additional articulated studies would be helpful to identify and understand recent human adaptation.</p>
