<abstract>
<p>The honeybee (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic>) has to cope with multiple environmental stressors, especially pesticides. Among those, the herbicide glyphosate and its main metabolite, the aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), are among the most abundant and ubiquitous contaminant in the environment. Through the foraging and storing of contaminated resources, honeybees are exposed to these xenobiotics. As ingested glyphosate and AMPA are directly in contact with the honeybee gut microbiota, we used quantitative PCR to test whether they could induce significant changes in the relative abundance of the major gut bacterial taxa. Glyphosate induced a strong decrease in <italic>Snodgrassella alvi</italic>, a partial decrease of a <italic>Gilliamella apicola</italic> and an increase in <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. abundances. <italic>In vitro</italic>, glyphosate reduced the growth of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>alvi</italic> and <italic>G</italic>. <italic>apicola</italic> but not <italic>Lactobacillus kunkeei</italic>. Although being no bee killer, we confirmed that glyphosate can have sublethal effects on the honeybee microbiota. To test whether such imbalanced microbiota could favor pathogen development, honeybees were exposed to glyphosate and to spores of the intestinal parasite <italic>Nosema ceranae</italic>. Glyphosate did not significantly enhance the effect of the parasite infection. Concerning AMPA, while it could reduce the growth of <italic>G</italic>. <italic>apicola in vitro</italic>, it did not induce any significant change in the honeybee microbiota, suggesting that glyphosate is the active component modifying the gut communities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Glyphosate, or N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine, is as a broad-spectrum herbicide used for weed control. It blocks the plant growth by inhibiting the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), an enzyme of the shikimate pathway involved in the synthesis of aromatic metabolites, including aromatic amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref002">2</xref>]. The EPSPS is present in plants but also in bacteria and fungi, but not in metazoans. Glyphosate is the most sprayed herbicide worldwide, especially under commercial formulations, the best known being Roundup. The frequency and intensity of glyphosate application as well as the surface of treated croplands have been growing constantly, especially since the marketing of Genetically Engineered Herbicide-Tolerant (GE-HT) crops. The wide use of the herbicide has for consequence the contamination of the environment by glyphosate and its metabolites, the most abundant being the aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA). AMPA is mainly produced from glyphosate metabolization by soil and saprophyte microorganisms and by second generation of GE-HT plants, but also from other human activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref005">5</xref>]. AMPA is more persistent than glyphosate in the environment. Glyphosate and AMPA can be found in all treated plant products but also in non-target plants, in the soil, in surface and groundwaters and even in the atmosphere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref003">3</xref>]. Since glyphosate and AMPA contaminate water and plant matrices, they can be ingested by animal consumers. For instance, by foraging contaminated pollen, nectar and water, pollinators are exposed to glyphosate and its metabolites.</p>
<p>The European honeybee, <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>, is the most commonly managed pollinator. It is the main pollinator of major crops and thus offers tremendous economic and ecosystem services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref007">7</xref>]. Honeybees are exposed to a variety of environmental stressors. Among them, pesticides have been suspected to be partly responsible for the colony losses observed worldwide. By gathering resources honeybee foragers bring back to the colony contaminated materials and the entire colony is then chronically exposed to pesticides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref008">8</xref>]. Glyphosate has been detected in various hive matrices, including pollen, nectar, honey and honeybee larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref013">13</xref>]. However few data are available concerning the effect of such exposure to glyphosate on the honeybee, and none concerning AMPA.</p>
<p>Despite its low toxicity to arthropods, glyphosate residues may have sublethal effects and affect their fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref018">18</xref>]. In the honeybee, glyphosate or Roundup formulation can induce an increase in lipid peroxidation, a decrease in β-carotene and derived antioxidants, and a reduction in acetylcholine esterase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref021">21</xref>]. A chronic exposure to the herbicide can reduce the honeybee learning performance while acute exposure was shown to reduce its short-term memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref023">23</xref>]. Glyphosate can also affect the honeybee navigation by increasing the time and path of homeward flight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref024">24</xref>]. Nothing is known concerning AMPA, whose toxicity was shown to be low on another arthropod, the crustacean <italic>Daphnia magna</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Once ingested by consumers, glyphosate and AMPA are in contact with the microbial communities of their gut. While glyphosate is known to affect the soil and aquatic microbial communities, its effects on animal gut communities is beginning to gain attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref003">3</xref>]. Indeed glyphosate residues can disturb the gut microbiota of mammals and reptilians and this dysbiosis could partly be due to the variable capacity of bacteria to proliferate in the presence of glyphosate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref029">29</xref>]. In the honeybee, the impact of a long-term exposure to glyphosate has recently been initiated. In the midgut of emerging honeybees reared <italic>in vitro</italic>, the bacterial beta-diversity was reduced and the abundance of bacterial taxa changed when larvae were fed with a diet containing glyphosate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref030">30</xref>]. Motta <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref031">31</xref>] showed that glyphosate also affect the microbiota of adult honeybee workers in the USA. The present work similarly aimed to assess the effect of glyphosate, but also of its main metabolite AMPA, on the installed gut microbial communities of adult honeybee workers in Europe. We thus discussed the results obtained in both studies.</p>
<p>The adult honeybee gut is colonized by microbial communities, almost exclusively bacteria, within the first week following the emergence of the imago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref033">33</xref>]. The core microbiota, that is common between workers, is relatively stable and simple. It is composed of five major bacterial taxa that are <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> Firm-4 and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> Firm-5, the gammaproteobacterium <italic>Gilliamella apicola</italic>, the betaproteobacterium <italic>Snodgrasella alvi</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> spp. related to the <italic>Bifidobacterium asteroides</italic> cluster. Among minor taxa, Alphaproteobacteria are the most abundant. We used Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (QPCR) to compare the abundance of these bacterial taxa in response to glyphosate and to AMPA. Bacterial strains were also isolated from honeybee guts to test whether their growth was sensitive to those contaminants.</p>

<title>Honeybees artificial rearing</title>
<p>Experiments were performed on interior workers collected on brood frames from five colonies of the same apiary in Clermont-Ferrand, France. All colonies came from <italic>A</italic>. <italic>mellifera ligustica</italic> Buckfast nuclei (Paul Jungels strain, Naturapi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref034">34</xref>]). Each of the five colonies represented an independent replicate. Workers were divided into cohorts of 70 individuals in cages, incubated and fed with sugar syrup, as described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref035">35</xref>]. In treated conditions, the syrup was supplemented with pure glyphosate (Interchim SS-7701) and/or AMPA (Sigma-Aldrich 324817).</p>
<p>A first experiment was performed on overwintering honeybees (February 2018) that were submitted to (i) no treatment, (ii) a chronic exposure to 1.5 mM glyphosate in their sugar syrup (or 0.21 g/kg according to syrup density), (iii) an infection with spores of the parasite <italic>Nosema</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic>, (iv) an infection by <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> and a chronic exposure to 1.5 mM glyphosate. Chronic exposure to herbicides was performed by feeding honeybees <italic>ad libitum</italic> with sugar syrup containing pesticides. The absence of <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> and <italic>Nosema apis</italic> in the colonies was checked by PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref035">35</xref>] on 20 honeybees before experiment initiation. <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> infection was performed one day before experiment initiation, by collectively infecting cohorts of 70 honeybees with a mean of 150 000 spores of the parasite per bee in 2.5 mL of syrup until complete consumption. <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> spores were obtained according to Vidau <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref036">36</xref>]. Dead bees were removed daily. Feeders were replaced and weighed daily to measure sucrose consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref035">35</xref>].</p>
<p>The surprisingly strong effect observed on the microbiota by glyphosate led us to repeat the experiment on cohorts of summer honeybees (June 2018) from the same five colonies, but with more concentrations and contaminants: (i) no treatment and chronic exposures to (ii) 1.5 mM (0.21 g/kg) glyphosate, (iii) 7.5 mM (1.08 g/kg) glyphosate, (iv) 1.5 mM (0.14 g/kg) AMPA, (v) 7.5 mM (0.70 g/kg) AMPA, (vi) 1.5 mM glyphosate and 1.5 mM AMPA, (vii) 7.5 mM glyphosate and 7.5 mM AMPA. The chosen concentrations of glyphosate are above most of the ones measured in hives matrices in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref013">13</xref>]. However they are related to the mean concentrations found in foraged pollen one day (0.47 g/kg) and four days (0.16 g/kg) following an experimental semi-field treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref011">11</xref>]. Our experiments would thus be related to an unusually persistent exposure to glyphosate.</p>

<title>Gut DNA purification and PCR quantification of bacterial taxa</title>
<p>Honeybees were sacrificed 15 days after the experiment initiation. The presence or absence of <italic>Nosema</italic> spores in individuals was checked by microscopy (x400). For each experimental condition and replicate, the full digestive tracts of 8 honeybees were dissected on ice, pooled and stored at -80°C. The total DNA of pooled guts was purified as described in Engel <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref037">37</xref>]. QPCR analyses were performed using the primers referenced in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215466.s007">S1 Table</xref>. All primer pairs targeted the small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA encoding gene but allowed the quantification of specific bacterial taxa that were <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> spp., all <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. or <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> Firm-5 clade only, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>alvi</italic> (two pairs: Neiss-F/Neiss-R and Beta-1009-qtF/Beta-1115-qtR), <italic>G</italic>. <italic>apicola</italic> (two pairs: Gamma1-459-qtF/Gamma1-648-qtR and Gill-F/Gill-R), Alphaproteobacteria, and the whole Bacteria taxon (two pairs: 341F/534R and BAC338F/BAC805R). QPCR reactions were performed in a final volume of 20 μL containing 0.5 volume of 2X Absolute Blue QPCR SYBR Green Mix (Thermo Scientific), 10 pmol of each primer and 5 to 25 ng of total genomic DNA. Negative controls (water) were included in each set of reactions. Treated and untreated samples from a same replicate were always deposited on the same plate and all plates were duplicated. The PCR conditions (CFX96 Real-Time System Thermocycler, BioRad) were 1 cycle at 94°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 25 s at 94°C, 25 s at 53°C and 25 s at 72°C. Specificity of reactions was checked by analyzing the melting curves of the amplified products. In order to avoid biases due to non-bacterial DNA (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. from the host or the parasite), QPCR data were normalized to the total bacterial DNA content estimated by the mean of the Cycle Quantification (CQ) obtained with 341F/534R and BAC338F/BAC805R primer pairs. The log2 of the ratio of a taxonomic group in a treated condition relative to the untreated one were obtained by subtracting the normalized CQ of control from the normalized CQ of the treated sample at the corresponding season and sampling day. Statistical analyses were performed using PAST software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref038">38</xref>]. Non-normal data gave no significant difference using paired Wilcoxon signed rank or Mann &amp; Whitney tests. Paired t-test was performed for normal data and differences were considered significant for <italic>p</italic>-values below 0.05. When a difference was significant, a similar positive or negative effect was observed in all of the five colony replicates.</p>

<title>Isolation and growth of gut bacterial strains</title>
<p>Single guts from nine interior honeybees were dissected and homogenized in 800 μL of 1X Phosphate-Buffered Saline. After serial dilutions, samples were plated onto Heart Infusion Broth (HIB) medium and MRS medium supplemented with fructose and cysteine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref037">37</xref>] and incubated for 48 h at 34°C under low O<sub>2</sub> and &gt;9% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere using Oxoid AnaeroGen sachets (Thermo Scientific). Colonies were picked up and isolated onto the same medium several times until axenic liquid cultures were obtained, as verified by replating and microscopic observation of Gram-stained bacteria. Thirteen strains were isolated and their genomic DNA was extracted. Their SSU encoding gene was amplified with the Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) using a 1:1:2 mix of primers 27f-YM, 27f-Bif and 1492r (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215466.s007">S1 Table</xref>). The amplification products were cloned into pGEM-T Vector (Promega). Following transformation and blue/white screening, colonies were cultured and their DNA extracted. The amplicon sequences were obtained using T7 and M13 primers (Eurofins Genomics) and deposited, after the trimming of vector and primer sequences, in GenBank database (accessions MH782109 to MH782121).</p>

Six independent cultures were performed for each herbicide concentration. After 48h of incubation as above, the optical density (OD) of the cultures were measured at 600 nm, using sterile medium as a blank.

<title>Glyphosate and AMPA were not lethal and did not alter food consumption</title>
<p>Survival analyses demonstrated that glyphosate but also AMPA, alone or together, did not induce any significant decrease in honeybee survival, compared to control, whatever the season (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215466.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). In contrast a significant decrease of survival was observed in <italic>Nosema</italic>-infected bees as previously observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref039">39</xref>]. No synergistic effect was observed between glyphosate and <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> or between glyphosate and AMPA. The constant decrease on survival in summer could be associated with the shorter lifespan of honeybees during the beekeeping season [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref040">40</xref>]. The data confirmed previous studies showing that glyphosate is no bee killer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref023">23</xref>] and showed that it is also true for AMPA. Thus, whatever the observed effects on the microbiota, they ought to be sublethal.</p>
<p>A decrease in food consumption by glyphosate-treated honeybees was suggested but not always observed in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref023">23</xref>].

The daily mean consumption of glyphosate and AMPA were between 49.2 and 57.4 nmol.d<sup>-1</sup>.bee<sup>-1</sup> and between 245 and 264 nmol.d<sup>-1</sup>.bee<sup>-1</sup> for exposures at 1.5 mM and 7.5 mM respectively.

<title>Glyphosate, but not AMPA, altered the abundance of the major honeybee gut bacteria</title>
<p>The honeybee gut microbiota can be altered by fungicides and acaricides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref042">42</xref>]. We tested whether it can be affected by the herbicide glyphosate or by its metabolite AMPA.

Two-way ANOVA showed significant interactions neither between season and glyphosate treatment, nor between glyphosate and <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic>, nor between glyphosate and AMPA.

<p>The present study confirmed the work of Motta <italic>et al</italic>.

<title>Glyphosate altered the microbiota by impairing the growth of some gut bacteria</title>
<p>The growth of axenic cultures <italic>in vitro</italic> showed that glyphosate reduced the generation time of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>alvi</italic> and <italic>G</italic>. <italic>apicola</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref031">31</xref>] as well as the biomass production of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>alvi</italic> and <italic>G</italic>. <italic>apicola</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> sp. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215466.g002">Fig 2</xref>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref031">31</xref>]). In contrast, the growth of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and other Firmicutes strains, including <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> and <italic>Lysinibacillus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215466.g002">Fig 2</xref>), as well as <italic>Bartonella apis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref031">31</xref>] was not altered by glyphosate. These differences may be related to the sensitivities of the EPSPS, the enzyme that is inhibited by glyphosate. Three classes of EPSPS have been characterized by experimental, structural and molecular analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref044">44</xref>]. The presence of conserved amino acids and the phylogenetic analyses of EPSPS showed that the enzymes of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>alvi</italic>, <italic>G</italic>. <italic>apicola</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> spp. belong to the glyphosate-sensitive Class Iα, and that the enzymes of Firmicutes and <italic>Bartonella</italic> belong to the glyphosate-resistant Class II (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215466.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). The sensitivity of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>alvi</italic>, <italic>G</italic>. <italic>apicola</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. EPSPS was confirmed by gene complementation in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref031">31</xref>]. Altogether, these data strongly suggest that glyphosate alters the honeybee gut microbiota by directly affecting the growth of species producing a glyphosate-sensitive EPSPS, especially <italic>S</italic>. <italic>alvi</italic>.</p>
<sec id="sec013">
<title><italic>G</italic>. <italic>apicola</italic> may comprise distinct populations with different sensitivities to glyphosate</title>
<p>The relative abundance in <italic>G</italic>. <italic>apicola</italic> in response to glyphosate showed contrasted results between the partial decrease observed in the present experiment and the increase observed in the study conducted by Motta <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref031">31</xref>]. Interestingly our results differed according to the primer pairs used for quantification. The abundance of <italic>G</italic>. <italic>apicola</italic> did not change using the G1-459-qtF/G1-648-qtR primers while it decreased using Gill-F/Gill-R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215466.g001">Fig 1</xref>). A phylogenetic analysis of <italic>G</italic>. <italic>apicola</italic> 16S sequences found in <italic>Apis</italic> species showed that the two primer pairs targeted different clades of <italic>G</italic>. <italic>apicola</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215466.s006">S6A Fig</xref>). No <italic>G</italic>. <italic>apicola</italic> sequence derived from <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> microbiota was found within the clades recognized by Gill-F/Gill-R, whereas amplification occurred using these primers. This suggested that the honeybee microbiota caries those targeted strains and that available sequence data do not depict the true diversity of <italic>G</italic>. <italic>apicola</italic>. <italic>G</italic>. <italic>apicola</italic> might comprise distinct phylotypes with different susceptibility to glyphosate. The contrasting increase in relative abundance of <italic>G</italic>. <italic>apicola</italic> observed by Motta <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref031">31</xref>] suggests that the phylotype richness may be even more composite, with variations that might depend on locations, landscape and/or genetic background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref046">46</xref>]. In response to the herbicide, <italic>G</italic>. <italic>apicola</italic> would experience a complex rebalancing of its phylotypes content.</p>
<p>The origin of the variation of <italic>G</italic>. <italic>apicola</italic> sensitivity toward glyphosate should be related to other adaptations than resistance of the EPSPS. Mechanisms of resistance to glyphosate, including the efflux and the enzymatic degradation of the herbicide, have been described in microorganisms isolated from contaminated soils and streams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref047">47</xref>]. However the presence of genes encoding phosphonate-degrading enzymes or transporters in a genome would not allow any assertion upon glyphosate resistance as the specificity of these proteins toward different phosphonate molecules, including glyphosate, may greatly vary.</p>
<p>Concerning <italic>S</italic>. <italic>alvi</italic>, the two primer pairs used for quantification gave similar results. This could be explained by their similar specificity, except for one clade that did not comprise taxonomic units from <italic>A</italic>. <italic>mellifera</italic> anyway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215466.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). Motta <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref031">31</xref>] did not mention clades responding differently to glyphosate. Thus, the whole <italic>S</italic>. <italic>alvi</italic> species could be affected by the herbicide.</p>

<title>Gut communities may be indirectly affected through ecological niches alteration</title>
<p>As expected, the growth of strains producing a glyphosate-resistant EPSPS were not affected by glyphosate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215466.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Glyphosate even induced an increase in the relative abundance of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215466.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Similarly, Motta <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref031">31</xref>] observed a reduced absolute abundance of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. but an increase in relative abundance of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> Firm-5 in one experiment on interior honeybees and of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> Firm-4 in one experiment on newly emerged workers. Several not exclusive hypotheses may be proposed to explain this positive impact of the herbicide.</p>
<p>Motta <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref021">21</xref>] suggested that the dependency of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. for amino acids released by other bacteria, such as <italic>S</italic>. <italic>alvi</italic>, could explain the absolute negative effect of glyphosate on both species. Such metabolic interactions between gut bacterial species were suggested by genomic data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref033">33</xref>]. The microbiota could thus be depicted as a consortium of symbiotic species that faces as a whole its environmental stressors. However experimental data are missing to demonstrate the strength of these interactions.</p>
<p>The observed relative increase in <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. may also be explained by experimental procedures since the use of total bacteria as a reference implies that a relative decrease in some species ought to be balanced by an increase in other taxa. A parallel but ecological hypothesis can be proposed. The reduction of some bacterial species could release ecological niches that would be occupied by others. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>alvi</italic> is thought to form a layer on the ileum wall, itself covered by a layer of <italic>G</italic>. <italic>apicola</italic>, whereas <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. are abundant in the lumen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref048">48</xref>]. <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. could benefit from changes in this biofilm-like organization in stressed honeybees by occupying the freed space.</p>
<p>Modifications in the microbiota could also be partly due to a global alteration in the gut homeostasis, keeping in mind that this homeostasis is itself regulated by the microbiota. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, a glyphosate-based formulation can induce a reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and an increase in antioxidant defenses, suggesting that the insect has to cope with an oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref016">16</xref>]. Such stress may occur in the honeybee as higher lipid peroxidation and lower carotenoids content were observed following an exposure to glyphosate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref020">20</xref>]. In mammals, glyphosate is also known to induce detoxification systems and to change the pH of intestinal content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref049">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref051">51</xref>]. Bacteria are diversely sensitive to those environmental conditions and such changes in their habitat could differently impact the bacterial taxa of the honeybee gut.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec015">
<title>Glyphosate may sensitize the honeybee to some but not all pathogens</title>
<p>The gut microbiota is known to protect the host against pathogens through the stimulation of the immune system and the competition for niche occupation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref052">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref054">54</xref>]. Thus gut pathogens may opportunistically benefit from the alterations of the microbiota.</p>
<p>It was shown that the suppression of gut bacteria increases the honeybee susceptibility to the intestinal parasite <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic>, while a supplementation with <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic> and <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> seemed to affect the reproduction success of the parasite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref055">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref056">56</xref>]. We tested whether glyphosate could potentiate the infection by <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic>. Glyphosate did not enhance the effect of the parasite on the honeybee mortality (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215466.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), sugar consumption (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215466.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) and gut bacterial abundances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215466.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This result contrasted with the higher susceptibility of glyphosate-treated honeybees toward an infection with <italic>Serratia marsescens</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref031">31</xref>]. The effect of glyphosate on the susceptibility of the honeybee to pathogens may thus depend on several parameters, such as, the type of pathogen, its sensitivity to the immune and detoxification systems, its capacity to compete with the normal gut flora and its sensitivity to glyphosate. Moreover, the sensitivity of the honeybee to pathogens also depends on a variety of stressors and laboratory experiments are themselves stressful conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref045">45</xref>].</p>
<p>Interestingly glyphosate may alter the growth of bacterial pathogens. <italic>Paenibacillus larvae</italic> and <italic>Melissococcus plutonius</italic>, the etiological agents of the American foulbrood (AFB) and European foulbrood (EFB) respectively, are bacteria that proliferate within the gut of honeybee larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref054">54</xref>] and their EPSPS belong to the glyphosate-sensitive Class I and to the glyphosate-resistant Class II respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215466.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Such differential sensitivity could lead to the odd hypothesis that <italic>M</italic>. <italic>plutonius</italic> could benefit from an imbalanced gut flora, favoring EFB, and in contrast, that glyphosate could reduce the development of the AFB. Future <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments could tell if glyphosate alters, in one way or another, the virulence of those gut pathogens.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec016">
<title>AMPA appeared to be no risk for the honeybee</title>
<p>The main metabolite of glyphosate, AMPA, that is more persistent and often more abundant than glyphosate in the environment, did not induce any significant change in the honeybee microbiota (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215466.g001">Fig 1</xref>), although it can affect the growth of <italic>G</italic>. <italic>apicola in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215466.g002">Fig 2</xref>). If <italic>G</italic>. <italic>apicola</italic> would include taxa with different sensitivities to glyphosate, it could be similar with AMPA. It is possible that the sensitive strain isolated in this work is scarce in the honeybee gut.</p>
<p>The mode of action of AMPA remains unclear. It has been suggested that, as a glycine analog, AMPA could inhibit the mammal serine hydroxymethyltransferase, or SHMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref057">57</xref>]. SHMTs are involved in the folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism, and thus in purine biosynthesis and in the reversible glycine to serine conversion. It has also been proposed that AMPA could act as an alanine analog that would inhibit enzymes involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis, explaining its antimicrobial properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref058">58</xref>]. Genes encoding all these enzymes are present in the genomes of the species discussed in this work, including <italic>G</italic>. <italic>apicola</italic>, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>alvi</italic> and <italic>L</italic>. <italic>kunkeei</italic>. The comparison of protein sequences with those available in the UniProt database did not allow formulating hypotheses about variation in their sensitivity and the higher sensitivity of <italic>G</italic>. <italic>apicola</italic> to AMPA may as well be linked to other mechanisms.</p>
<p>The absence of bacterial response to AMPA <italic>in vivo</italic> demonstrated that glyphosate itself is the active component affecting the microbiota. Its degradation to AMPA may contrariwise reduce its effects, although the toxicity of AMPA on the honeybee physiology is unknown. In the environment, glyphosate is mainly degraded into AMPA by soil and saprophyte bacterial and fungal communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215466.ref005">5</xref>]. Such transformation would be beneficial for the honeybee by reducing the concentration of glyphosate.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In the context of honeybee population decline, where combinations of environmental contaminants are suspected, the weakening of honeybee health through the exposure to xenobiotics of low toxicity may be of importance. Glyphosate has sublethal effects on the honeybee gut microbiota, changing the abundance of major bacterial taxa, especially by affecting the growth of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>alvi</italic>. The consequences of such microbial disturbance are unclear: is the honeybee able to cope with glyphosate and preserve the gut homeostasis or will future data demonstrate that this changes are linked with a functional dysbiosis?</p>
<p>An increasing amount of data proves that the honeybee microbiota takes its part in the response to stressors, showing that the whole holobiont, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. the honeybee and its microbial communities, should be considered when challenging environmental constraints.</p>

<title>Principal component analyses of QPCR data (A) for control and 1.5 mM glyphosate-treated samples in summer and winter, and (B) for glyphosate- and AMPA-treated samples in summer.</title>
<p>Analyses were performed using the normalized CQ (relative to total bacterial content). In order to avoid redundant data for the same taxa, values obtained using <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> Firm-5 primers as well as Neiss-F/Neiss-R and Gill-F/Gill-R were omitted. Very similar results were obtained exchanging primer pairs data for a same bacterial taxon. Using glyphosate data only on both season (A), PCA analysis showed that 91.6% of the variance were explained by two principal components that seemed mainly linked to the season and to the glyphosate treatment. However, two-ways ANOVA (not shown) did not detect significant interaction between herbicides and season. Using the data in summer (B), PCA revealed that 70.9% of the variance was explained to one single component mostly related to glyphosate treatment, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>alvi</italic> being the main variable correlated with the component.</p>
