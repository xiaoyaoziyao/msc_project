        <p>Adaptive radiation is usually triggered by ecological opportunity, arising
                    through (<italic>i</italic>) the colonization of a new habitat by its
                    progenitor; (<italic>ii</italic>) the extinction of competitors; or
                        (<italic>iii</italic>) the emergence of an evolutionary key innovation in
                    the ancestral lineage. Support for the key innovation hypothesis is scarce,
                    however, even in textbook examples of adaptive radiation. Antifreeze
                    glycoproteins (AFGPs) have been proposed as putative key innovation for the
                    adaptive radiation of notothenioid fishes in the ice-cold waters of Antarctica.
                    A crucial prerequisite for this assumption is the concurrence of the
                    notothenioid radiation with the onset of Antarctic sea ice conditions. Here, we
                    use a fossil-calibrated multi-marker phylogeny of nothothenioid and related
                    acanthomorph fishes to date AFGP emergence and the notothenioid radiation. All
                    time-constraints are cross-validated to assess their reliability resulting in
                    six powerful calibration points. We find that the notothenioid radiation began
                    near the Oligocene-Miocene transition, which coincides with the increasing
                    presence of Antarctic sea ice. Divergence dates of notothenioids are thus
                    consistent with the key innovation hypothesis of AFGP. Early notothenioid
                    divergences are furthermore congruent with vicariant speciation and the breakup
                    of Gondwana.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Adaptive radiation - the evolution of ecological and phenotypic diversity within a
                rapidly multiplying lineage - has been implicated in the genesis of a great portion
                of the diversity of life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Simpson1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Schluter1">[2]</xref>. According to Schluter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Schluter1">[2]</xref>, an adaptive radiation is
                characterized by rapid speciation, common ancestry, and a phenotype-environment
                correlation, whereby phenotypes must actually be beneficial in their respective
                environments. Adaptive radiation is often considered a consequence of ecological
                opportunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Simpson1">[1]</xref>,
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Schluter1">[2]</xref> arising
                through colonization of a new habitat with abundant niche-space, extinction of
                antagonists, and/or the origin of a key innovation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Yoder1">[3]</xref>. All three settings induce the
                relaxation of selection pressure, which may promote diversification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Yoder1">[3]</xref>. Key innovations
                can lead to ecological opportunity either by enabling the exploitation of new
                resources, or by boosting a clade's fitness relative to competing lineages. A
                third type of key innovation does not generate ecological opportunity, but directly
                enhances diversification rates by increasing the potential for reproductive
                isolation or ecological specialization, e.g. by decreasing dispersal distance and
                gene flow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Heard1">[4]</xref>.
                Corroboration of the key innovation hypothesis would, hence, involve the
                identification of (ecological) mechanisms linking a putative key innovation to
                increased speciation or decreased extinction rates, and comparative tests
                correlating it with inflating diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Heard1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>So far, such tests have been applied to few key innovations only, and even the best
                examples of animal adaptive radiations provide only scanty evidence in support of
                the key innovation hypothesis. Two of the most prominent examples of adaptive
                radiation, the Galapagos finches and Hawaiian honeycreepers, were, in fact, more
                likely triggered by the arrival of the ancestral species on competitor-free islands
                rather than by key innovations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Lack1">[5]</xref>. A number of key innovations have been proposed for the
                radiations of cichlid fishes in the Great Lakes of East Africa, including a highly
                variable pharyngeal jaw apparatus, egg-spots, and maternal mouth brooding behaviour
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Salzburger1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Salzburger2">[7]</xref>. However,
                based on a comparative analysis of successful and failed cichlid radiations, the
                role of all three traits as key innovations has been questioned <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Seehausen1">[8]</xref>. Similarly,
                the acquisition of pharyngeal jaws provides a weak explanation for increased
                diversification rates in the radiation of labrid fishes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Alfaro1">[9]</xref>. A key innovation in Caribbean
                    <italic>Anolis</italic> lizards, on the other hand, appears to pass both the
                ecological mechanism and comparative test: extended subdigital toe-pads enable
                    <italic>Anolis</italic> to climb narrow twigs, leaves and grass blades. The
                resultant arborality distinguishes them from other iguanids. Toepads evolved at the
                base of the anole phylogeny, and also occur in the second-most species rich family
                of lizards, the Gekkonidae, thus linking its emergence with species richness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Losos1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Another vertebrate adaptive radiation, which has drawn increasing interest in recent
                years, has occurred on the isolated shelf areas surrounding the Antarctic continent
                in the perciform fish suborder Notothenioidei. A total of 132 notothenioid species
                are known to date, and new species are discovered at fast rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Eastman1">[11]</xref>. Nine species
                belong to three early diverging families (Bovichtidae, Pseudaphritidae,
                Eleginopidae) that occur almost exclusively outside Antarctic waters and are not
                usually considered part of the radiation. The remaining 123 species in five families
                are often referred to as the “Antarctic Clade”, which dominates the High
                Antarctic ichthyofauna in terms of species number (76.6%) and biomass
                (&gt;90%) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Eastman1">[11]</xref>. Notothenioids of the Antarctic Clade possess a wide
                range of adaptations to the extreme Antarctic environment, including antifreeze
                glycoproteins (AFGP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Chen1">[12]</xref>, retinal reorganization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Pointer1">[13]</xref>, and loss of heat shock
                response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Hofmann1">[14]</xref>.
                One of the five Antarctic notothenioid families (Channichthyidae) even lives without
                hemoglobin, which is unique among vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Eastman2">[15]</xref>. Despite the loss of the swim
                bladder in their presumably benthos-dwelling ancestor, multiple notothenioid
                lineages have independently recolonized pelagic, semi-pelagic and cryopelagic
                habitats. Subsequent adaptations in ossification, scale mineralization, and lipid
                deposition led to a partial or full reaquisition of neutral buoyancy and a
                phenotype-environment correlation that is characteristic for adaptive radiations
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Schluter1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Eastman1">[11]</xref>. Another
                important phenotype-environment correlation exists between freezing avoidance and
                water temperature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Bilyk1">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Antifreeze glycoproteins are present in almost all notothenioids of the Antarctic
                Clade, enabling them to cope with the subzero temperatures of Antarctic waters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Cheng1">[17]</xref>. The widespread
                possession of AFGPs in the monophyletic Antarctic Clade, complete lack of AFGPs in
                non-Antarctic sister groups, and their highly conserved chemical structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Eastman2">[15]</xref> suggest that
                AFGPs evolved only once in notothenioids and that this occurred prior to the onset
                of diversification in the Antarctic Clade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Chen1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Cheng1">[17]</xref>. Therefore, it has been
                hypothesized that AFGPs represent a key innovation that allowed notothenioids to
                radiate at a time when Antarctic water temperatures dropped below zero, which
                presumably led to the extinction of a great part of the previous Antarctic shelf
                ichthyofauna <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Eastman2">[15]</xref>. Following Heard and Hauser <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Heard1">[4]</xref> AFGPs would constitute a type I
                key innovation if the resulting fitness advantage enabled notothenioids to replace
                other clades, a type II key innovation if AFGPs allowed the invasion of previously
                unoccupied sea ice-associated habitats, or a combination of both. A crucial
                prerequisite for either hypothesis is the concurrence of the beginning of the
                notothenioid radiation and the onset of Antarctic sea ice conditions.</p>
      <p>Cenozoic Antarctic water temperatures and the emergence of sea-ice in Antarctica can
                be inferred from deep sea isotope records and sediment analysis of drill cores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Pagani1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Olney1">[21]</xref>. The timing of
                the notothenioid radiation, on the other hand, is far less certain, which is in part
                due to the paucity of fossils in Antarctica. Existing molecular clock calibrations
                for notothenioids are based on few mitochondrial markers in combination with a
                single putative, but debated, eleginopid fossil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Near1">[22]</xref>, biogeographic patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Bargelloni1">[23]</xref>, or the
                presumed date of the perciform diversification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Chen2">[24]</xref>. Consequently, attempts to date
                the beginning of the notothenioid radiation have led to a wide range of
                contradicting results between 7 and 24 Ma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Near1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Bargelloni2">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we use a multi-marker (4599 bp, 6.53% missing data) phylogeny including
                representatives of all notothenioid families plus 69 non-notothenioid fishes with
                ten fossil and phylogeographic constraints to time-calibrate notothenioid
                divergences and AFGP evolution.</p>

                    rendering this order paraphyletic (albeit with low support values).
                    Notothenioids were recovered as a sister group of a clade containing percids,

                    suggests polyphyly of serranids, with representatives of the family in close

                    representative species. While this number might appear small in the context of
                    notothenioid phylogenetics and divergence rate estimates (which was, notably,
                    not the purpose of this study), it is absolutely balanced with respect to the

        <title>Cross-Validation of Time Constraints</title>
        <p>We first cross-validated the available 10 calibration points in order to test for
                    their relative consistency. This step is important, as calibrations based on
                    fossil and geological data show various degrees of uncertainty <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Near3">[32]</xref>. When
                    estimated on the basis of all other constraints, five out of ten divergence
                    dates were concordant with the respective fossil age assignments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018911-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The split between
                    gempylids and scombrids (node D; 79.2–18.4 Ma, 95% highest
                    probability density (HPD)) seems to postdate respective fossil findings and
                    suggest taxonomic or stratigraphic misinterpretations. The mean age estimate for
                    the polymixiid lineage (99.2 Ma) falls into the Cenomanian, as does the oldest
                    polymixiid fossil. Nevertheless, this constraint was excluded from further
                    analyses, as nearly half of its HPD (133.1–70.5 Ma) postdates the
                    Cenomanian. Age estimates for both cichlid and labrid divergences failed to
                    match phylogeographic calibrations, which were therefore excluded. Estimated on
                    the basis of nine constraints, the diversification of Percomorpha
                    (203.3–135.0 Ma) seems to predate the earliest euteleost fossils (150.9
                    Ma) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Patterson1">[33]</xref>.
                    However, after exclusion of constraints A, C, D, E, and F, re-estimation
                    resulted in younger percomorph divergence estimates (150.9–114.7 Ma),
                    being congruent with the euteleost fossil record.</p>

        <title>Notothenioid Divergence Dates</title>
        <p>According to cross-validation results, we estimated divergence dates of
                    notothenioids on the basis of six fossil constraints (nodes B, C, G, H, I, and
                    J; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018911-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018911.s006">Table S2</xref>).
                    Our results support a late Cretaceous origin of Bovichtidae (node U, mean 71.4
                    Ma, 95% HPD 89.4–54.4 Ma), early Paleocene divergence of
                    Pseudaphritidae (node V, 63.0 Ma, 80.2–46.7 Ma), and a Mid-Eocene split
                    between Eleginopidae and the Antarctic Clade (node W, 42.9 Ma, 56.9–29.8
                    Ma). Mid-Eocene origin of the eleginopid lineage is congruent with the age of
                    the only fossil putatively assigned to Notothenioidei. <italic>Proeleginops
                        grandeastmanorum</italic> from the La Meseta Formation on Seymour Island
                    (dated to ∼40 Ma) was first described as a gadiform fossil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Eastman3">[34]</xref>, and
                    subsequently reinterpreted as an eleginopid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Balushkin1">[35]</xref>. While previous attempts
                    to date the notothenioid radiation used this fossil as a single calibration
                    point, our analysis deliberately excluded this constraint due to its debated
                    taxonomic assignment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Near1">[22]</xref>. Nevertheless, the concordance between divergence
                    date estimates and fossil age corroborates the eleginopid interpretation of
                        <italic>P. grandeastmanorum</italic>. Radiation of the Antarctic Clade began
                    near the Oligocene-Miocene transition with the divergence of
                        <italic>Gobionotothen</italic> (node X, 23.9 Ma, 31.9–16.7 Ma) and was
                    quickly followed by further diversification within the Antarctic Clade (node Y,
                    21.4 Ma, 28.2–15.3 Ma). Correspondingly, support values for early
                    nototheniid divergences are low (node Y, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018911.s005">Table S1</xref>), indicating rapid succession of
                    speciation events. Excluding <italic>G. gibberifrons</italic> from the data set
                    indicates that regardless of the exact topology of the Antarctic Clade, the
                    radiation was underway in the early Miocene (23.0 Ma, 30.5–16.1 Ma). This
                    is in agreement with previous age estimates (24.1±0.5 Ma) on the basis of
                    the putative eleginopid fossil <italic>P. grandeastmanorum</italic> and a
                    penalized likelihood molecular analysis approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Near1">[22]</xref>. Diversification of the four
                    most derived notothenioid families Harpagiferidae, Artedidraconidae,
                    Bathydraconidae, and Channichthyidae apparently began in the mid-Miocene (node
                    Z, 14.7 Ma, 20.0–9.9 Ma). Close agreement of percid divergence dates (node
                    T, 28.54–54.71 Ma) with biogeographical scenarios suggests that clades
                    closely related to notothenioids were dated reliably (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018911.s010">Text S1</xref>).

                    climate models with explicit, dynamical representations of sea ice show that

                    continental glaciation and marine ice comes from cyclic glacimarine deposits in
                    offshore drill cores, showing that glacial extensions well onto the continental
                    shelf occurred repeatedly since the early Oligocene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018911-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Cape1">[20]</xref>. Furthermore, the long-term
                    presence of local sea ice is suggested by findings of sea ice-dependent diatoms
                    in lower Oligocene sediments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Olney1">[21]</xref>. Taken together, it is likely that Antarctic sea ice
                    has existed with seasonal, orbital, and local constraints since the early
                    Oligocene. Estimates for the onset of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current range

                    but its increasing strength presumably contributed to thermal isolation and

                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Nong1">[42]</xref>. Deep

                    transition (Mi-1 event, 24.1–23.7 Ma, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018911-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Naish1">[43]</xref>. This exactly coincides with
                    our mean age estimate for the onset of the Antarctic notothenioid radiation
                    (23.9 Ma), which is characterized by the presence of AFGPs. Based on the highly

                    Antarctic Clade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Eastman2">[15]</xref>, it is commonly assumed that AFGPs evolved only once,

                    avoidance could have allowed notothenioids to invade new, ice-associated niches,
                    or to replace other clades subsequent to their extinction in a cooling
                    environment. Without doubt, selection pressures must have been substantial,
                    given that freezing avoidance is a matter of life and death in ice-laden
                    habitats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Cheng2">[44]</xref>.
                    Emergence of AFGPs could have proceeded in a step-wise manner that began with
                    accidental replication slippage in an intron of the ancestral trypsinogen gene
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Chen1">[12]</xref>.
                    Subsequent duplications of Thr-Ala-Ala tripeptides could have endowed some
                    measures of freezing avoidance without immediate loss of trypsin activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Cheng2">[44]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The key innovation hypothesis of AFGP would further be corroborated if similar
                    diversity was found in other clades that independently acquired freezing
                    avoidance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Heard1">[4]</xref>.
                    Outside notothenioids, near-identical AFGPs have convergently evolved in Arctic

                    dates back to the Miocene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Bakke1">[48]</xref>. The subfamily consists of 23 species and may thus be
                    considered moderately species-rich. Type III antifreeze proteins (AFP) are found
                    in zoarcids of both Antarctic and Arctic waters, and supposedly predate the
                    bipolar distribution of zoarcids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Fletcher1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Anderson1">[49]</xref>. With over 200 species,
                    the family Zoarcidae is indeed a highly diverse group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Anderson1">[49]</xref>, and surpasses even
                    notothenioids in species richness. However, AFPs have been identified in
                    comparatively few zoarcids to date <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Fletcher1">[47]</xref>, which may indicate
                    secondary losses in many taxa. Whether AFP played a role in the zoarcid
                    radiation remains to be elucidated. The distribution of type I AFPs over
                    phylogenetically distant clupeids, osmerids, and cottids of the northern
                    hemisphere provides a rare example of lateral gene flow in vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Graham1">[50]</xref> and
                    indicates strong selection pressures. However, none of these AFP-bearing taxa
                    have undergone substantial radiations. This could be due to external factors
                    that mask the effect of AF(G)P emergence in non-notothenioid taxa. Most adaptive
                    radiations occur in geographically confined areas, a potential prerequisite

                    that is satisfied for Antarctic continental shelves, but less so for Arctic

                    Australian continental shelves in the late Cretaceous. Fragmentation of shelf
                    areas between Australia and New Zealand ∼70 Ma may have led to the

                    divergences within Bovichtidae. Extended pelagic larval durations could have
                    contributed to long-ranged eastward dispersal of bovichtids with paleogene
                    currents to South America and Tristan da Cunha <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Balushkin2">[52]</xref>. The isolation of

                    presumably linked to the breakup of Australia and Antarctica. Separation between
                    both landmasses started between 125 and 90 Ma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Anderson2">[53]</xref>, however, shallow water

        <title>Time Constraints used for Dating</title>
        <p>A total of eight fossil, and two phylogeographic constraints were chosen to
                    time-calibrate acanthomorph divergences. Following Benton &amp; Donoghue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Benton1">[58]</xref>, we
                    implemented time constraints for the origin of Tetraodontidae (node J;
                        <italic>Takifugu</italic>-<italic>Tetraodon</italic> divergence;
                    56.0−32.25 Ma) and for the split between Gasterosteiformes and
                    Tetraodontiformes (node G; 150.9−96.9 Ma). The minimum age for the
                    Gasterosteiformes-Tetraodontiformes divergence is derived from the oldest known
                    member of the tetraodontiform lineage, <italic>Plectocretacicus clarae</italic>,
                    which also represents the oldest known percomorph. Also, the maximum constraint
                    for divergence of gasterosteiform and tetraodontiform lineages is provided by
                    the earliest euteleost record, <italic>e.g. Tischlingerichthys viohli</italic>.
                    Therefore, we applied the same lower and upper bounds for the divergence of all
                    Percomorpha (not including <italic>Dicrolene introniger</italic>, as the
                    phylogenetic position of Ophidiiformes remains unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Miya1">[26]</xref>; node C). Uniform priors
                    between minimum and maximum age of divergence were used for these constraints.
                    In addition, we constrained five family divergences, which we expected to have
                    relatively early fossil records in at least one of the descending lineages
                        (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018911.s003">Fig.
                        S3</xref>). Thus, our analysis accounted for polymixiid fossils from the
                    Cenomanian (node A; ≥93.5 Ma), a zeid fossil from the Thanetian (node B;
                    ≥55.8 Ma), gempylid and scombrid fossils from the Danian (node D; ≥61.7
                    Ma), a chaunacid fossil from the Bartonian (node H; ≥37.2 Ma), and a
                    monacanthid fossil from the Ypresian (node I; ≥48.6 Ma). All used fossils are
                    referenced in detail in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018911.s016">Text S7</xref>. Lognormal priors were assigned to
                    the above fossil constraints with hard lower bounds reflecting the age of the
                    respective fossil, and soft upper bounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018911.s009">Table S5</xref>,

                    constraints for cichlid and labrid divergences were derived from the breakup of
                    Gondwana, and from the closure of the connection between the Mediterranean and
                    the Indian Ocean. We added the separation of Africa and South America as
                    effective time constraint for the split between African and neotropical cichlids
                    (node E), assuming vicariant divergence. Seafloor spreading in the South
                    Atlantic started as early as 133 Myr ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Storey1">[59]</xref> and a continuous
                    North/South Atlantic Ocean presumably existed ∼100 Myr ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Sereno1">[60]</xref>, hence, we
                    applied a normally distributed prior between 121.8 and 98.2 Ma (95%
                    cumulative probability; mean: 110.0 Ma) to constrain cichlid divergence. The
                    split between <italic>Labrus</italic> and both <italic>Ctenolabrus</italic> and
                        <italic>Tautogolabrus</italic> (node F) represents the diversification of

                    it has been suggested that the ancestor of Labrini migrated from the Indopacific

                    run results, three different substitution models were implemented and evaluated.
                    We included the codon position-based
                        HKY<sub>112</sub>+CP<sub>112</sub>+Γ<sub>112</sub> model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Shapiro1">[64]</xref>, in which
                    all parameters are estimated independently for the first two and for the third
                    codon positions. We also added the
                        GTR<sub>112</sub>+CP<sub>112</sub>+Γ<sub>112</sub> model,
                    using the same partitions. In a third set, we implemented HKY+I+Γ
                    for the first two mitochondrial codon positions, TVM+Γ for the third
                    mitochondrial codon position, K80+I+Γ for the first nuclear codon
                    position, and GTR+Γ for the third nuclear codon position, as selected
                    by BIC. For each of the three setting, we performed 20 independent analyses of
                    20 million generations each, discarding the first 2 million generations of every
                    replicate as burnin. Replicate results were combined in LogCombiner v1.5.3 after
                    removing the burnin. Convergence of run replicates was confirmed by effective

                    traces within and between replicates in Tracer v1.5. Substitution models were
                    evaluated on the basis of Bayes Factors, again, as implemented in Tracer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Suchard1">[65]</xref>. Bayes
                    Factors provided ‘very strong’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018911-Kass1">[66]</xref> evidence that the

                    analyses. In order to assess the reliability of every individual time
                    constraint, we conducted a cross-validation, whereby we relaxed constraints one

                    constraints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018911-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). BEAST
                    runs were conducted as described above, but using 5 run replicates per
                    cross-validation. We found good fit of posterior and prior distributions for
                    constraints B, G, H, I, and J. Subsequently, 20 run replicates were performed
