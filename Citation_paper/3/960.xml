        <p><italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> infects half the world's population, and carriage is lifelong without antibiotic therapy. Current regimens prescribed to prevent infection-associated diseases such as gastroduodenal ulcers and gastric cancer can be thwarted by antibiotic resistance. We reported that administration of 1% <sc>d</sc>,<sc>l</sc>-Î±-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) to mice infected with <italic>H. pylori</italic> reduces gastritis and colonization, which we attributed to enhanced host immune response due to inhibition of macrophage ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis. Although no ODC has been identified in any <italic>H. pylori</italic> genome, we sought to determine if DFMO has direct effects on the bacterium. We found that DFMO significantly reduced the growth rate of <italic>H. pylori</italic> in a polyamine-independent manner. Two other Gram-negative pathogens possessing ODC, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic>, were resistant to the DFMO effect. The effect of DFMO on <italic>H. pylori</italic> required continuous exposure to the drug and was reversible when removed, with recovery of growth rate <italic>in vitro</italic> and the ability to colonize mice. <italic>H. pylori</italic> exposed to DFMO were significantly shorter in length than those untreated and they contained greater internal levels of ATP, suggesting severe effects on bacterial metabolism. DFMO inhibited expression of the <italic>H. pylori</italic> virulence factor cytotoxin associated gene A, and its translocation and phosphorylation in gastric epithelial cells, which was associated with a reduction in interleukin-8 expression. These findings suggest that DFMO has effects on <italic>H. pylori</italic> that may contribute to its effectiveness in reducing gastritis and colonization and may be a useful addition to anti-<italic>H. pylori</italic> therapies.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> is a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen that selectively colonizes the human stomach. It infects more than 50% of the world's population and is the causative agent of disorders that arise from the resulting chronic inflammation, ranging from dyspepsia and gastritis to gastric and duodenal ulcers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Fox1">[1]</xref>. It is also strongly associated with development of gastric cancer, the second most common cause of cancer death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Ferlay1">[2]</xref>. <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection usually occurs early in life and although there is an immune response elicited by the organism, it is insufficient to eliminate the bacteria. Infection therefore generally persists for the lifetime of the host, though cure is possible with antimicrobial therapy. The current standard of care prescribed to eliminate <italic>H. pylori</italic>âconcurrent administration of a proton pump inhibitor and two antibioticsâis not effective for all patients, and in some regions eradication rates can be as poor as 50% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Camargo1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Mera1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Goodman1">[5]</xref>. As antibiotic resistance is continually rising, novel chemotherapeutic agents are of interest.</p>
      <p>We recently reported that chronic administration of 1% (w/v) <sc>d</sc>,<sc>l</sc>-Î±-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) in the drinking water to mice infected with <italic>H. pylori</italic> SS1 led to a reduction in both the level of colonization and the severity of gastritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Chaturvedi1">[6]</xref>. DFMO is an analogue of the amino acid ornithine, which in eukaryotes and many bacteria is a substrate of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the enzyme responsible for catalyzing the conversion of the amino acid into the polyamine putrescine, which can then be converted to the polyamines spermidine and spermine by specific synthases. As such, DFMO serves as an irreversible inhibitor of ODC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Haegele1">[7]</xref>. Polyamines are polycationic molecules present in all living organisms that are essential for the synthesis of macromolecules (e.g. DNA, RNA and protein) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Pendeville1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Tabor1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Balasundaram1">[10]</xref>. The pathways of polyamine biosynthesis are well-understood for eukaryotes and for the model bacterial species <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Michael1">[11]</xref>, but the full mechanisms of polyamine production in <italic>H. pylori</italic> have not been described and no sequenced strain possesses an ODC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Tomb1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Alm1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Baltrus1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Oh1">[15]</xref>. However, because of the clinical efficacy that we had observed <italic>in vivo</italic>, we investigated whether DFMO has any direct effect on <italic>H. pylori</italic> that could account, at least in part, for its effectiveness in reducing inflammation and bacterial load in infected mice.</p>
      <p>We now report that growth of <italic>H. pylori</italic> in broth cultures supplemented with 1% DFMO was substantially inhibited and that the generation time was nearly doubled, but that the effects of DFMO were not associated with alterations in polyamine levels and could not be reversed with polyamine supplementation. In addition, exposure to DFMO induced a morphological change in the bacteria, such that they appeared closer to a coccoid form, and also caused elevated intracellular levels of ATP. In gastric epithelial cells, the prototypical inflammatory response to <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection is the induction of the neutrophil chemoattractant IL-8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Moss1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Resnick1">[17]</xref>, which has been associated with injection of the product of the <italic>H. pylori</italic> gene cytotoxin associated gene (<italic>cag</italic>) <italic>A</italic>, namely CagA, into these cells by a type IV secretion system (T4SS), followed by its phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Odenbreit1">[18]</xref>. We now demonstrate that <italic>H. pylori</italic> exposed to DFMO for only 12 h showed a marked reduction of <italic>H. pylori</italic> CagA protein expression as well as less translocation of CagA and decreased phospho-CagA within human gastric epithelial cells. Moreover, DFMO-treated bacteria exhibited a reduced ability to induce mRNA expression and secretion of IL-8 in these cells. These studies indicate that direct effects of DFMO on <italic>H. pylori</italic> may be important for the drug's effectiveness <italic>in vivo</italic> and that polyamine-independent effects of DFMO mediate its effects on the bacterium.</p>

        <p>Experiments were performed to determine the permanence of the inhibitory properties of DFMO on <italic>H. pylori</italic>. Brucella broth cultures were started with or without DFMO. After 6 or 12 h of growth, the cultures were collected and pelleted by centrifugation. The bacteria were then resuspended in media with or without DFMO such that four different growth conditions resulted. Growth was monitored by optical density. In addition, bacterial morphology was determined using Gram stain to monitor changes induced by exposure to DFMO. To more precisely quantify size variations, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used. Culture aliquots were removed, pelleted by centrifugation and washed in PBS. The bacteria were then fixed with 2.5% gluteraldehye and then washed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer. The samples were postfixed in 1% aqueous osmium tetroxide, dehydrated through a graded series of ethanols to 100% ethanol, and then embedded in Spurr Resin. Thin sections of the resin-embedded material were examined using a Philips CM-12 high-resolution transmission electron microscope and images were captured by a CCD camera at 11,500X magnification. The size of the bacteria was determined by analyzing the images with NIH ImageJ (version 1.41o) to measure the area of identified <italic>H. pylori</italic>. Briefly, the threshold command was used to separate bacteria from the background and the two-dimensional area of each cell was calculated in Âµm<sup>2</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Papadopulos1">[28]</xref>.</p>

        <p>We recently reported that in mice infected with the mouse-adapted strain <italic>H. pylori</italic> SS1, administration of 1% DFMO suppressed both bacterial colonization and gastric inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Chaturvedi1">[6]</xref>. Notably, this is the same dose of DFMO that has been shown to be efficacious in mouse models of colon tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Yerushalmi1">[35]</xref>. Although no sequenced <italic>H. pylori</italic> genome has been found to contain an ODC, we investigated whether DFMO had any direct effect on the bacterium. <italic>H. pylori</italic> are primarily found in the surface mucous layer of the stomach, and we began with the assumption that in our <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse model the 1% DFMO in the drinking water would reach the <italic>H. pylori</italic> bacteria at this concentration, and the DFMO is replenished continuously by ongoing intake of this agent in the drinking water. Therefore, we initiated our studies with 1% DFMO (55 mM) in liquid culture media. Flasks of broth, some supplemented with different percentages of DFMO, were inoculated with <italic>H. pylori</italic> SS1 at an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.1 and growth was monitored by optical density for 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017510-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Growth of <italic>H. pylori</italic> in broth containing 1% DFMO was restricted beginning 4 h post-inoculation, while lower concentrations had no effect. When we repeated these growth curves to quantify the inhibitory effects of the chemical, we observed that <italic>H. pylori</italic> SS1 grown in standard broth had a generation time of 4.1 h during the exponential growth phase from 0â12 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017510-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, 1% DFMO significantly increased the generation time to 7.3 h (<italic>p&lt;</italic>0.001), an increase of 78% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017510-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). We also monitored growth of <italic>H. pylori</italic> by diluting and plating the bacteria at time points from 0 to 24 h.

        <title>The mechanism of growth inhibition does not involve polyamines</title>

To further examine the permanence of these effects we carried out experiments in which bacterial cultures were begun in one mediumâeither with or without 1% DFMOâand then switched after 6 h of growth, a time point at which growth suppression and metabolic perturbation is already apparent. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017510-g004">Figure 4B</xref> illustrates that cultures maintained in one medium (i.e. no DFMO, or continuous DFMO) exhibited growth patterns identical to those seen in earlier experiments. In addition, cultures begun in unadulterated medium and then switched to broth containing DFMO showed a nearly immediate reduction in growth rate. Importantly, the cultures initiated in broth containing 1% DFMO that were then switched to plain medium at 6 h were able to recover very quickly, so that by 12 h of additional growth they had attained the same growth rate as the cultures continuously grown without DFMO (generation time of 4.4 h vs. 4.5 h, <italic>pâ=â</italic>0.363). This rapid resurgence suggested that rather than being killed by exposure to DFMO, the chemical instead had a bacteriostatic effect. When we repeated these experiments with switching delayed until 12 h had elapsed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017510-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) the results were similar, except that those <italic>H. pylori</italic> transferred from 1% DFMO to control medium exhibited a lesser ability to recover compared to bacteria switched after 6 h. After 12 h of additional growth, generation time in continuous control medium was 7.0 h while that in the cultures switched from DFMO to normal medium was only 9.2 h (<italic>p</italic>â=â0.0502).</p>

        <title>DFMO alters cell morphology</title>
        <p>Due to the manner of bacterial replication, via binary fission, growth rate can be linked with bacterial size. We therefore determined if DFMO induced any alterations in bacterial morphology. To test this, we sampled bacteria from the 6 h switching experiment and performed Gram stains at 6 h after the medium switch. The bacteria from cultures containing 1% DFMO appeared to be smaller than bacteria from cultures without DFMO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017510-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Due to the low resolution afforded by light microscopy, we also prepared samples of bacteria for transmission electron microscopy. Sections of bacterial pellets were examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017510-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) and the sizes of individual bacteria were determined using NIH ImageJ software. As was suspected from the Gram stains, bacteria cultured in the presence of 1% DFMO were significantly smaller than those cultured in plain broth (<italic>p&lt;</italic>0.001). We also observed that 6 h after removal of DFMO bacterial size had significantly increased (<italic>p&lt;</italic>0.001), and that 6 h of culture with DFMO after switching was sufficient to significantly reduce bacterial size (<italic>p&lt;</italic>0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017510-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).

        <p>The discovery that bacterial morphology was altered by exposure to DFMO caused us to reexamine our investigations using optical density, as such measurements could be dependent on bacterial size and shape.

        <title>DFMO affects bacterial metabolism</title>
        <p>Monitoring bacterial growth by optical density has inherent limitations, as both live and dead cells can remain in suspension and contribute to an apparent increase in the number of growing bacteria. We attempted to circumvent this problem by quantifying viable cells by diluting and plating the culture on solid medium. Although we did begin to see a decrease in the number of culturable bacteria after 8 h of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017510-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), optical density levels diverged 4 h prior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017510-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and significant die-off of <italic>H. pylori</italic> was not seen until 24 h of culture with 1% DFMO. Our inference was that rather than having a bactericidal effect, DFMO was altering cell metabolism, which led to a significant decrease in growth rate. To determine if this was the case, we utilized a luciferase-based assay to measure ATP levels in bacterial lysates. Unexpectedly, rather than inducing a decrease in ATP, DFMO had the opposite effect. When we analyzed equal volumes of cultures grown with or without 1% DFMO, we observed a significant increase in ATP levels beginning only 1 h after initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017510-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). ATP levels per microliter increased steadily over time for both cultures until the 24 h time point, when levels in DFMO-containing cultures leveled off. For control bacteria there was obvious parallelism between the ATP levels and the OD<sub>600</sub> growth curve shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017510-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, but this was not seen for bacteria exposed to DFMO. As ATP levels can be used as a surrogate measure of cell numbersâfor comparably grown culturesâwe presumed that the observed increase simply indicated continued growth of <italic>H. pylori</italic>. To eliminate this uncertainty we used the optical density of the cultures, and the equation derived from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017510-g005">Figure 5D</xref>, to calculate the ATP-dependent luminescence per 10<sup>6</sup> bacteria. This transformation demonstrated that the effect of DFMO was even greater than initially perceived. When compared to control cultures, DFMO induced a 1.5-fold increase in luminescence by 1 h that grew to 3.4-fold by 12 h (<italic>p&lt;</italic>0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017510-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). We also observed that while the control culture maintained a relatively steady level of ATP/10<sup>6</sup> bacteria throughout the entire time course (405.8Â±28.8 luminescence units), large dynamic changes were seen in the 1% DFMO cultures, suggesting that the chemical drastically altered the metabolism of <italic>H. pylori</italic>.</p>

      <p><italic>H. pylori</italic> is a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide.

Most infections induce only mild gastritis, but if left untreated they can lead to gastric and duodenal ulceration or gastric cancer. Standard treatment regimens are known to be far less than 100% effective <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Camargo1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Mera1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Goodman1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Fischbach1">[59]</xref>, indicating that novel therapies could be useful, especially given high rates of antibiotic resistance worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Fischbach1">[59]</xref>. In our recent publication on the protective effect of DFMO administration on <italic>H. pylori</italic>-induced gastritis in miceâindicated by reduced inflammation and colonizationâwe concluded that it was attributable to the beneficial effects of the chemical's inhibition of host ODC activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Chaturvedi1">[6]</xref>. In the current report we have demonstrated that a direct effect of DFMO on the bacteria may also be important.</p>
      <p>Our data indicate that exposure to 1% DFMO suppresses growth of <italic>H. pylori</italic> such that generation time is nearly doubled. The mechanism of action does not appear to involve polyamine synthesis since there was no detectable ornithine decarboxylase activity in the bacteria and supplementation with downstream polyamine products was unable to reverse the effect. In addition, other Gram-negative bacterial species that do contain ODC were found to be insensitive to the inhibitory effect of DFMO. This lack of effect on other bacteria suggests that the DFMO is not overtly toxic at this dose. Additionally, the concept that the action of DFMO was not a result of direct toxicity of the chemical was supported by our finding that <italic>H. pylori</italic> were not immediately killed, and in fact responded with increased ATP levels. We found that the induced alterations required continuous exposure to DFMO and were reversible by halting exposure. We also noted that the alterations to growth rate and metabolism could be observed as a change in bacterial morphology, with DFMO causing the <italic>H. pylori</italic> to adopt a more coccoid form. These altered bacteria expressed lower levels of CagA, translocated less CagA, and induced 50% less IL-8 expression in gastric epithelial cells than untreated bacteria, despite there being no difference in adherence to these epithelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
      <p>In order to affect growth of <italic>H. pylori</italic> a high concentration of 1% DFMO (equivalent to 55 mM) was required. This dose was the same as was administered to mice <italic>ad libitum</italic> in our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Chaturvedi1">[6]</xref>. Given that a mouse weighs between 20 and 25 g and consumes 10â15 mL of water daily, this implies that each mouse receives a daily DFMO dosage in the range of 4000â7500 mg/kg. Allometric dose translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-ReaganShaw1">[60]</xref> for human administration would be approximately 500 mg/kg. Although this dose is high, similar or higher levels have been used for treatment of trypanosomiasis, via inhibition of the parasite's ODC. Clarkson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Clarkson1">[61]</xref> cured experimentally infected mice with a 14-day course of 2% DFMO and a single dose of the anti-protozoal agent suramin. The same group also reported that late-stage human sleeping sickness could be cured by 14 days of intravenous 400 mg/kg DFMO followed by 3â4 weeks of oral dosage at 300 mg/kg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Doua1">[62]</xref>. Although there were side effects at this dosage, including diarrhea and abdominal pain, all were reversible, and treatment of <italic>H. pylori</italic> would likely not require such a lengthy period of treatment.</p>
      <p>Previous studies have indicated that exposure of <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> to the polyamine synthesis inhibitors monofluoromethylornithine, difluoromethylarginine, and dicyclohexylammonium sulfate significantly increased bacterial generation times and could be overcome by addition of exogenous polyamines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Bitonti1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Bitonti2">[64]</xref>. However, the inhibitory effect on <italic>H. pylori</italic> growth likely involves an alternative mechanism, as the genome of this species contains no recognized ODC gene, and the bacteria possess no ODC activity. In our studies we also found that <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>C. rodentium</italic>, two bacterial species that do possess an ODC, were completely insensitive to the inhibitory effects of DFMO. The polyamine pathways of <italic>H. pylori</italic> are not completely understood and may be unique, as the species is missing a number of biosynthetic enzymes found in other bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Tomb1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Alm1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Baltrus1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Oh1">[15]</xref>. In addition, the sequenced genomes of <italic>H. pylori</italic> contain no recognizable polyamine transporters. It has been suggested that in the high-acid environment of the stomach all polyamines would be completely protonated and therefore unable to be acted on by known polyamine binding proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Michael1">[11]</xref>. In our experiments, DFMO had no effect on intracellular or extracellular polyamine levels of bacterial cultures and supplementation with either putrescine or spermidine did not restore the growth rate to normal levels. Although none of our findings indicate the involvement of polyamine metabolism in the mechanism of action of DFMO on <italic>H. pylori</italic>, others have targeted polyamine synthesis in this bacterium using methylglyoxal bis(cyclopentylamidinohydrazone) (MGBCP), an inhibitor of multiple enzymes, including spermidine synthase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Takaji1">[65]</xref>. Exposure to MGBCP caused a dramatic reduction in the growth of <italic>H. pylori in vitro</italic>, but the authors suggested that the localization of <italic>H. pylori</italic> within the mucus layer of the highly acidic stomach could limit its chemotherapeutic effectiveness. Our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Chaturvedi1">[6]</xref> indicates that DFMO is effective <italic>in vivo</italic> in a mouse model when administered continuously after inoculation with <italic>H. pylori</italic>.</p>
      <p>In our recently published report we noted that treatment of <italic>H. pylori</italic>-infected mice with DFMO led to decreased colonization via enhanced antimicrobial nitric oxide generation by host macrophages, which we attributed to the drug's effect on host cell ODC that can otherwise inhibit translation of inducible nitric oxide synthase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Chaturvedi1">[6]</xref>. The current study suggests that direct effects of DFMO on the bacteria may play a role as well. When we attempted to separate these two effects by infecting mice with <italic>H. pylori</italic> SS1 pre-treated with DFMO for 12 h, after 1 month of infection without treatment of the mice with DFMO, there was no observable difference in colonization. We attributed this to the rapid recovery of the bacteria once they were in the mouse stomach and no longer exposed to DFMO, a supposition that was supported when we performed growth curves in which we removed DFMO supplementation from growing bacterial cultures and observed the swift improvement of growth rate to normal levels. In the future we will determine the relative importance of the drug's effects on the bacteria and host by administering DFMO to heterozygous ODC<sup>+/â</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Nilsson1">[66]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Guo1">[67]</xref>, which we will use because homozygous deletion of ODC is lethal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Pendeville1">[8]</xref>. If the reduced gastritis and colonization are recapitulated in infected ODC<sup>+/â</sup> mice, and if there is an even greater reduction with DFMO treatment, this could suggest that drug effects on the bacteria are important for its ameliorative properties.</p>
      <p><italic>H. pylori</italic> morphologic form may have a bearing on to its viability and infectivity, but the literature on <italic>H. pylori</italic> coccoid forms is not consistent. Coccoid forms were observed in one prospective study of human gastric biopsies in 83% of cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Chan1">[68]</xref> and it has been suggested that they may provide a source for the spread of infection or of recrudescence in patients reportedly cured <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Andersen1">[69]</xref>. Other reports on coccoid forms have reached a variety of conclusions: that coccoid bacteria are a manifestation of cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Kusters1">[70]</xref>; that they are a viable, but non-culturable form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Bode1">[71]</xref>; that coccoid forms can successfully infect mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-She1">[72]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Wang1">[73]</xref>; and that they are unable to colonize neonatal pigs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Eaton1">[74]</xref>. Irrespective of the controversy surrounding the nature of coccoid bacteria, the morphologically altered <italic>H. pylori</italic> we observed may differ from those seen in other studies. The changes we report here occur very rapidly, after only 6 h of exposure to DFMO, while other studies induced coccoid forms by multi-day culture or exposure to antibiotics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-She1">[72]</xref>. In addition, whereas some have noted a decrease in cellular activity following conversion of <italic>H. pylori</italic> to a coccoid form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Kusters1">[70]</xref>, we measured higher internal levels of ATP after DFMO treatment. This observed increase could indicate an upregulation of ATP production or a downregulation of ATP usage leading to an accumulation of the molecule. The latter seems more likely as it correlates with the decrease in growth rate that we demonstrated. Another recent discovery is that the state of peptidoglycan crosslinking in <italic>H. pylori</italic> plays an important role in maintaining its helical shape that is important in its motility and infectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Sycuro1">[75]</xref>. While knockouts of cell shape determinant (<italic>csd</italic>) genes did not affect growth <italic>in vitro</italic> in that study, it still could prove important to investigate the effects of DFMO on peptidoglycan and associated <italic>csd</italic> genes in future experiments.</p>
      <p>Increased expression of IL-8 is part of the immune response to <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Bartchewsky1">[40]</xref>. As the known interaction of DFMO with host cells prevents discrimination of the effect of DFMO on bacteria in the stomach we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments using the human gastric AGS cell line in the absence of DFMO in the cocultures and observed that IL-8 expression was significantly reduced. Some studies using coccoid-form bacteria have reported that they induce lower levels of IL-8 in epithelial cells, and, concomitantly, adhere to a lesser degree than helical <italic>H. pylori</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Cole1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Osaki1">[45]</xref>. Our data indicate no loss of adherence of DFMO-treated bacteria, suggesting that other alterations of bacterial physiology are responsible for the reduction in IL-8 expression. Production of the chemokine IL-8 by the gastric epithelium elicits an influx of neutrophils that are the hallmark of the acute gastritis associated with <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Peek1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Wilson2">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Marshall1">[76]</xref>. Thus, administration of DFMO to patients could lead to reduced IL-8 expression by epithelial cells and a reduction of inflammation.</p>
      <p>Urease is an important virulence factor of <italic>H. pylori</italic>. It is responsible for the hydrolysis of urea into ammonia that acts to rapidly neutralize the low pH of the acidic stomach environment. We utilized UreB, a subunit of the urease enzyme, as a control in our bacterial Western blots and noted no decrease in its expression with DFMO exposure. To further investigate if urease was affected by DFMO, we measured enzymatic activity in both <italic>H. pylori</italic> SS1 and 60190. Consistent with the Western blot results, DFMO had no effect on the urease activity after either 3 or 6 h of culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017510.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p>
      <p>The <italic>cag</italic>-PAI comprises a set of virulence genes encoding the components of a T4SS able to deliver bacterial products into host cell cytoplasm. The bacterial effector protein CagA is encoded within the <italic>cag</italic>-PAI and when introduced into epithelial cells it triggers a variety of signaling events that affect host cell processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Peek1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Wilson2">[47]</xref>. Some reports have indicated that IL-8 production by AGS cells is CagA-dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Argent2">[77]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Kim1">[78]</xref>, though it should be recognized that other studies have reported a CagA-independent induction of this chemokine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Argent1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Fischer1">[79]</xref>. We observed that bacteria grown in media containing 1% DFMO exhibited decreased CagA protein expression and that AGS cells incubated with such bacteria contained lower levels of phosphorylated CagA, indicating an additional potential benefit for the chemotherapeutic use of this drug. Interestingly, prolonged coculture of <italic>H. pylori</italic> with AGS cells led to recovery from the DFMO-induced suppression of total CagA protein levels so that after 12 h no difference remained. Since the phosphorylated form of CagA is found only inside AGS cells, while total CagA levels are indicative of both the translocated protein and that remaining in the bacteria adherent to the epithelial cells, our data indicate that the effect of DFMO on CagA expression dissipates more rapidly during the recovery of <italic>H. pylori</italic> in AGS medium than does its effect on phospho-CagA levels. The persistent inhibition of CagA phosphorylation may be due to inhibition of translocation of CagA via post-transcriptional effects on genes involved in the T4SS. In addition, we have found that AGS cell culture medium poorly supports <italic>H. pylori</italic> growth, and it is much more restrictive than Brucella broth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017510.s004">Figure S4</xref>), and thus it is possible that the apparent normalization of CagA levels are part of an overall stress response that overshadows the effect of DFMO. Our data suggest that DFMO alters CagA expression via a post-transcriptional mechanism. Such control has been reported for other <italic>H. pylori</italic> genes including the flagellar protein FlaA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Douillard1">[51]</xref>, neutrophil activating protein (Nap) A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Barnard1">[52]</xref>, and the global regulator HP1043 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Muller1">[53]</xref>. FlaA protein levels are partially regulated by destabilization of the <italic>flaA</italic> mRNA transcript <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Douillard1">[51]</xref>, but when we measured stability of <italic>cagA</italic> from cultures grown with or without DFMO there was no increase in decay rate that could account for the decreased level of CagA protein. It should be noted that while some human patients are infected with <italic>cagA</italic><sup>â</sup> strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Peek1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Wilson2">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Parsonnet1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-PerezPerez2">[49]</xref>, DFMO is likely to still have beneficial effects in such people, because of its growth inhibitory effects. It is also likely that other effects on <italic>H. pylori</italic> genes could be occurring, which could be addressed by discovery studies using proteomic or microarray analyses.</p>
      <p>Although we have not determined the molecular mechanism by which DFMO suppresses <italic>H. pylori</italic> growth, this drug may be a useful adjunctive treatment for human <italic>H. pylori</italic> infections. DFMO is used as treatment for trypanosomiasis, as mentioned above, and oral DFMO (500 mg daily) has been found safe and effective as part of a chemopreventive regimen for recurrent colorectal adenomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017510-Meyskens1">[80]</xref>. To our knowledge, there are no reports on the usage of DFMO as an antibacterial agent <italic>in vivo</italic>, despite the fact that interference with the polyamine biosynthetic pathways could be an attractive target for retarding fast-growing infections. Although we would not suggest its use as a monotherapy, DFMO treatment could be considered as a future addition to current standard regimens, especially in regions of the world where <italic>H. pylori</italic> exhibits high levels of antibiotic resistance.</p>
