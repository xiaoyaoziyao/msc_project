      <abstract>
        <p>We examined anti-tumor effects of zoledronic acid (ZOL), one of the bisphosphonates agents clinically used for preventing loss of bone mass, on human mesothelioma cells bearing the wild-type <italic>p53</italic> gene. ZOL-treated cells showed activation of caspase-3/7, -8 and -9, and increased sub-G1 phase fractions. A combinatory use of ZOL and cisplatin (CDDP), one of the first-line anti-cancer agents for mesothelioma, synergistically or additively produced the cytotoxicity on mesothelioma cells. Moreover, the combination achieved greater anti-tumor effects on mesothelioma developed in the pleural cavity than administration of either ZOL or CDDP alone. ZOL-treated cells as well as CDDP-treated cells induced p53 phosphorylation at Ser 15, a marker of p53 activation, and up-regulated p53 protein expression levels. Down-regulation of p53 levels with siRNA however did not influence the ZOL-mediated cytotoxicity but negated the combinatory effects by ZOL and CDDP. In addition, ZOL treatments augmented cytotoxicity of adenoviruses expressing the <italic>p53</italic> gene on mesothelioma. These data demonstrated that ZOL-mediated augmentation of p53, which was not linked with ZOL-induced cytotoxicity, played a role in the combinatory effects with a p53 up-regulating agent, and suggests a possible clinical use of ZOL to mesothelioma with anti-cancer agents.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The majority of mesothelioma development is tightly linked with occupational asbestos exposure and the patient numbers are increasing worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Tada1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Robinson1">[2]</xref>. Approximately 70–80% of mesothelioma cells have the wild-type <italic>p53</italic> gene but show a homologous deletion at the INK4A/ARF locus containing the <italic>p14<sup>ARF</sup></italic> and the <italic>p16<sup>INK4A</sup></italic> genes, which consequently leads to decreased p53 functions despite the wild-type genotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Altomare1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Altomare2">[5]</xref>. Prognosis of the mesothelioma patients is dim in most of the cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Tada1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Robinson1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Robinson2">[6]</xref>. Extrapleural pneumonectomy is applicable only for the patients in an early clinical stage and mesothelioma is essentially resistant to radiation. Chemotherapy is therefore the primary treatment but produced limited anti-tumor effects. A combination of cisplatin (CDDP) and pemetrexed is currently the first-line regimen but an average survival period with the agents is about 12 months <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Vogelzang1">[7]</xref>. The clinical outcome even with the updated combinatory chemotherapy is thus unsatisfactory and a possible second-line agent has not yet been known. A novel therapeutics is thereby required and restoration of decreased p53 functions is one of the strategies.</p>
      <p>Bisphosphonates (BPs) are synthetic analogues of pyrophosphate and have a strong affinity for mineralized bone matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Yuasa1">[8]</xref>. BPs inhibit bone absorption through interfering osteoclasts' actions, and are currently used as a therapeutic agent for osteoporosis, malignancy-linked hypercalcemia and similar bone diseases. Recent reports demonstrated that BPs also achieved cytotoxicity on tumor cells through apoptosis induction and produced anti-tumor effects <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Green1">[9]</xref>. The BPs-mediated effects <italic>in vivo</italic> were evidenced with osseous tumors or with bone metastasis of non-osseous tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Green2">[10]</xref>. Moreover, a number of studies also demonstrated the anti-tumor effects <italic>in vivo</italic> with non-osseous tumors despite BPs being readily excreted from body and accumulated in bone tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Skerjanec1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Clzardin1">[12]</xref>. The mechanism of BPs-mediated cytotoxicity is dependent on BPs structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Yuasa1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Green1">[9]</xref>. The first generation of BPs is converted into non-hydrolyzable cytotoxic ATP analogues which decrease mitochondrial membrane potentials. Both the second and the third generations inhibit farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase and deplete isoprenoid pools, which subsequently results in decreased prenylation of small guanine-nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (small G proteins). The unprenylated form does not bind to cell membrane and the decreased membrane-bound fraction reduces functions of small G proteins since membrane binding is required for the biological activities including cell survival. It remains however uncharacterized as to the precise mechanisms of cytotoxicity induced by down-regulated functions of small G proteins.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we examined cytotoxic activities of zoledronic acid (ZOL), one of the third generation of BPs, on human mesothelioma cells and investigated a possible combinatory use of CDDP with ZOL. We found that ZOL induced up-regulation of p53 expression and the phosphorylation, but down-regulated p53 expression had little effects on the ZOL-induced cytotoxicity. Nevertheless, the ZOL-mediated p53 activation contributed to combinatory effects with CDDP.</p>

        <title>ZOL-induced cytotoxicity and caspase activation</title>
        <p>We examined a possible cytotoxic action of ZOL on mesothelioma cells with the WST assay and found that both mesothelioma cells, MSTO-211H and EHMES-10, were susceptible to ZOL with a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060297-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Cell cycle analyses showed that ZOL increased sub-G1 phase fractions in MSTO-211H cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060297-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0060297-t001">Table 1</xref>), indicating that ZOL induced cell death. We also tested ZOL-induced unprenylation of Rap 1A, one of small G proteins, and confirmed that ZOL inhibited the prenylation in both cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060297-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). We investigated a possible activation of caspase-3/7, -9 and -8 by testing the cleaving activity of a specific substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060297-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). ZOL treatments at 1 µM did not induce activation of respective caspases but those at 10 µM activated the caspases in MSTO-211H cells. These data collectively indicated that ZOL treatments activated cell death processes through the caspase cleavages in mesothelioma cells.</p>

        <title>Combinatory cytotoxic effects of ZOL and CDDP</title>
        <p>We investigated combinatory effects of ZOL and CDDP in MSTO-211H and EHMES-10 cells. We calculated respective IC<sub>50</sub> values of each agent to know an optimal test rang and then examined cytotoxicity at various doses of both agents with a constant concentration ratio according to the CalcuSyn software instruction. Combination of ZOL and CDDP achieved cytotoxicity greater than each agent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060297-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) and statistical analyses showed that CI values at Fa points below 0.8 in MSTO-211H cells were less than 1 and those between 0.15 and 0.8 Fa points in EHMES-10 cells were close to but under 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060297-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). These CI values demonstrated that both ZOL and CDDP achieved cytotoxicity synergistically in MSTO-211H cells, and additively, or possibly slightly synergistically, in EHMES-10 cells. Cell cycle analyses indicated that sub-G1 phase populations in ZOL- plus CDDP-treated MSTO-211H cells were greater than those in ZOL- or CDDP- treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060297-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), suggesting that the enhanced cytotoxic activities by the combination of ZOL and CDDP were attributable to increased apoptotic cell death.</p>

        <title>ZOL induced p53 activation</title>
        <p>We examined whether p53 activation was involved in the ZOL-mediated cytotoxicity since the p53 pathways play a key role in apoptosis induction. Firstly, we tested possible p53 activation in wild-type <italic>p53</italic> mesothelioma with CDDP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060297-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). CDDP-treated MSTO-211H and EHMES-10 cells induced phosphorylation of p53 at the Ser 15 residue, a hallmark of p53 activation, and up-regulated p53 protein levels. We then examined influence of ZOL on p53 expressions and found that ZOL treatments phosphorylated p53 at Ser 15 and augmented p53 protein levels in both cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060297-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). These data showed that ZOL induced p53 activation and subsequently raised a possibility that the ZOL-mediated cytotoxicity was caused by p53 activation. We also investigated the combinatory effects of CDDP and ZOL on the p53 phosphorylation at Ser 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060297-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). The phosphorylation level in cells treated with both agents was greater than that in cells treated with either CDDP or ZOL, suggesting that both agents cooperatively activated the p53 pathways.</p>

        <title>Down-regulated p53 action on cytotoxicity and on combination effect</title>
        <p>We further investigated a possible involvement of p53 activation in the ZOL-mediated cytotoxicity by down-regulating p53 expression with siRNA. The p53-siRNA treatment markedly decreased p53 expression and the phosphorylation level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060297-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). The down-regulated p53 however minimally affected the ZOL-induced cytotoxicity in MSTO-211H cells, at least in lower concentrations, and rather slightly enhanced the cytotoxicity in EHMES-10 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060297-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>). Control siRNA treatments unexpectedly increased the cytotoxicity in MSTO-211H cells at high ZOL concentrations. These data suggested that the ZOL-mediated cytotoxicity was independent of p53 activation. We also analyzed cell cycle changes in ZOL-treated MSTO-211H cells after they were transfected with p53-siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060297-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0060297-t002">Table 2</xref>). Cell cycle distributions showed that p53-siRNA treatments marginally influenced the ZOL-mediated increase of sub-G1 phase populations. The decreased level of sub-G1 phase fractions due to the p53-siRNA treatment was disproportionately lower than that of the p53 protein expression after transfection with siRNA. In contract, the p53-siRNA treatment increased S and G2/M phase and decreased G0/G1 phase fractions, showing that down-regulated p53 promoted cell cycle progression. These data demonstrated that decreased p53 levels influenced the cell cycle but little affected the ZOL-mediated cytotoxicity, and confirmed that the ZOL-induced p53 activation was irrelevant to the ZOL-mediated cytotoxicity. Control-siRNA treated cells increased sub-G1 phase fractions, which accorded with the WST results. It could be due to non-specific cytotoxicity of control siRNA in MSTO-211H cells but the mechanism underling is currently unknown.</p>

        <p>We examined whether up-regulated p53 levels by ZOL increased p53-mediated cytotoxicity.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study we demonstrated that ZOL alone and the combination with CDDP produced anti-tumor effects on mesothelioma. ZOL up-regulated p53 expression but the ZOL-mediated cytotoxicity was scarcely dependent on the p53 induction, suggesting that the cytotoxicity was due to inhibition of small G proteins' functions. Down-regulated p53 levels on the other hand negated the synergistic actions by ZOL and CDDP, indicating that the ZOL-induced p53 activation contributed to the combinatory anti-tumor effects produced with CDDP.</p>
      <p>The majority of mesothelioma cells has defect of p14<sup>ARF</sup>, which results in an increased level of Mdm2 that induces p53 degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Yang1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Kim1">[15]</xref>. Augmentation of p53 is therefore a possible therapeutic strategy for mesothelioma by restoring p53 functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-HoskinsDonaldson1">[16]</xref>. The present study indicated that ZOL phosphorylated p53 and up-regulated the expression levels, suggesting a crucial role of p53 induction in the ZOL-mediated cytotoxicity. ZOL in fact activated caspases and increased sub-G1 phase populations. The knockdown experiments with p53-siRNA however demonstrated that p53 activation itself did not contribute to the ZOL-mediated cytotoxic actions. A possible involvement of the p53 pathways in ZOL-mediated cytotoxicity may need further investigations but the present data evidenced that the up-regulated p53 level in ZOL-treated cells was irrelevant to the cytotoxicity as reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Kuroda1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Ory1">[18]</xref>. The ZOL-induced cytotoxicity can be therefore attributable to inhibited prenylation of small G proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Yuasa1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Green2">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>ZOL-induced activation of p53 nevertheless contributed to the cytotoxicity by other agents of which the functions were linked with p53 levels. CDDP is one of such agents and augmented p53 levels in target tumors facilitate CDDP-induced cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Siddik1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Benassi1">[20]</xref>. In fact our previous study showed that Ad-p53-transduced MSTO-211H cells produced synergistic cytotoxicity with CDDP, and that the CI values were below 1 between 0.2 and 0.8 Fa points <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Li1">[21]</xref>. The present study demonstrated that combination of ZOL and CDDP produced synergistic or additive anti-tumor effects on mesothelioma with the wild-type <italic>p53</italic> gene. The combination increased sub-G1 phase populations and decreased tumor volumes in an orthotopic animal model, but down-regulation of p53 with the siRNA completely nullified the combinatory effects. These data suggested that ZOL-induced p53 up-regulation favored CDDP-mediated cytotoxicity through further augmenting the p53 pathways. Benassi <italic>et al</italic> recently reported similar results with paired cells, <italic>p53</italic>-mutated and the isogeneic <italic>p53</italic>-wild-type parent cells from osteosarcoma, that combinatory effects of ZOL and CDDP were p53-dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Benassi1">[20]</xref>. The present study furthermore analyzed the interactions between the two agents and demonstrated synergistic or additive actions in the combination as well as the <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy. The interactions became antagonistic under the p53-siRNA treatment, which suggested that loss of ZOL-induced p53 up-regulation was rather inhibitory to CDDP-mediated cytotoxicity. These data consequently suggest that the ZOL-mediated up-regulated p53 pathways contributed to combinatory effects with CDDP. ZOL-mediated inhibitory actions on small G proteins' prenylation were probably not influenced by cellular p53 levels because down-regulation of p53 did not affect the ZOL-mediated cytotoxicity. The inhibited prenylation itself may produce possible combinatory effects with CDDP but the p53-siRNA treatment which produced antagonistic effects suggested that mechanistic association between unprenylated small G proteins and CDDP was unlikely.</p>
      <p>Transduction levels of Ad-p53 determined p53-dependent cytotoxicity, and a combinatory use of ZOL and Ad-p53 produced additive, and possibly slightly synergistic, cytotoxic effects. A possible role of Ad-p53 in the combinatory effects through inducing further unpreylation of small G proteins was probably minimal since ZOL-mediated cytotoxicity was independent of p53 levels. Nevertheless, ZOL augmented endogenous p53 levels and the up-regulation appeared to sensitized tumor cells to be susceptible to a p53 up-regulating agent. ZOL can induce unprenylation of non-small G proteins but it remains uncharacterized whether such unprenylated non-small G proteins can produce cytotoxicity in ZOL-treated cells. Synergism between CDDP and ZOL was greater than that between Ad-p53 and ZOL probably because CDDP-mediated p53 up-regulation and over-expression of p53 with Ad-p53 are not equal from the standpoint of signal transduction systems. For example, CDDP-treated cells can activate non-p53-mediated pathways and Ad-mediated transduction activates type I interferons-mediated pathways.</p>
      <p>The present data suggested a possible clinical application of ZOL for mesothelioma in combination with CDDP or Ad-p53. In fact, Ad-p53 has been used in clinical trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Senzer1">[22]</xref>, and ZOL and CDDP are commonly used for cancer patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Yuasa1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Rossi1">[23]</xref>. We demonstrated combinatory anti-tumor effects of ZOL and CDDP on non-osseous tumors as reported on osseous tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Benassi1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Horie1">[24]</xref>. Therapeutic activities of ZOL on tumors nevertheless seem to be less significant in non-osseous tissues than those in osseous tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Green1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Green2">[10]</xref> because ZOL is readily excreted from kidney and cannot be maintained at a high concentration except in bone tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Green2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Skerjanec1">[11]</xref>. Recent studies however showed that ZOL in combination with imatinib and doxorubicin produced greater cytotoxicity than monotherapy even against non-osseous tumors, Bcr-Abl-positive leukemina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Kuroda2">[25]</xref> and breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Ottewell1">[26]</xref>, respectively. These data indicated that ZOL, even through a systemic administration route, produced anti-tumor effects together with other cytotoxic agents. Moreover, mesothelioma can be one of the suitable targets of ZOL in clinical settings because the intrapleural administration is speculated to keep a relative high concentration of ZOL at tumor sites compared with an intravenous injection, although this remains to be proven. The present study suggests that ZOL administered intrapleurally and CDDP injected systemically may produce a therapeutic benefit to mesothelioma patients. Our preliminary study showed that intrapleural administration of 40 µg ZOL at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml in mice, which was equivalent to 7.8–9.8 mg in human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-ReaganShaw1">[27]</xref> and was 10 times higher drug concentration than the current clinical dose (4 mg in total and 0.04 mg/ml at the concentration), did not cause any body weight changes or other adverse reactions such as inflammatory reactions (data not shown), showing a feasible intrapleural injection of ZOL with safe.</p>
      <p>We also showed that Ad-p53 suppressed the viability of mesothelioma and produced combinatory anti-tumor effects with ZOL. Intrapleural injections of Ad-p53 were in fact conducted safely in patients with pleural effusions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Liu1">[28]</xref>. Previous studies demonstrated that Ad-p53 activated the p53 pathways and achieved combinatory anti-tumor effects with an anti-cancer agent including CDDP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Li1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Horio1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Weinrib1">[30]</xref>. The mechanism of ZOL-mediated p53 induction remains unclear but the p53-inducible p21 is a downstream target of Ras and RhoA, the major molecules of small G proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-BarSagi1">[31]</xref>. Inhibited protein prenylation can cause downstream activation of p53, and ZOL thereby is a candidate to analyze a possible cross-talk between small G proteins and the p53 pathways. Previous studies also showed that combinatory cytotoxicity of ZOL and an anti-cancer agent was linked with ZOL-mediated inhibition of P-glycoprotein functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Horie1">[24]</xref> and that a combinatory use of doxorubicin and ZOL inhibited angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060297-Ottewell1">[26]</xref>. These studies indicated possible p53-independent cytotoxicity of ZOL that could synergize with other agents through multiple mechanisms.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that ZOL produced cytotoxic activities on mesothelioma and a combinatory use with CDDP or Ad-p53 produced better therapeutic effects than monotherapy with a single agent. ZOL-mediated p53 up-regulation was not involved in the ZOL-induced cytotoxicity in EHMES-10 cells, and in MSTO-211H cells at least at low concentrations at which synergistic effects were observed with CDDP, but contributed to combinatory anti-tumor effects of CDDP or Ad-p53. Based on the current study we presume that an intrapleural injection of ZOL, which is technically feasible, in combination with CDDP, the first-line agent for mesothelioma, is a potential therapeutics for mesothelioma.</p>
