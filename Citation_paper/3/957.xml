        <p>We evaluated the mechanism of capsaicin-mediated ROS generation in pancreatic cancer cells. The generation of ROS was about 4–6 fold more as compared to control and as early as 1 h after capsaicin treatment in BxPC-3 and AsPC-1 cells but not in normal HPDE-6 cells. The generation of ROS was inhibited by catalase and EUK-134. To delineate the mechanism of ROS generation, enzymatic activities of mitochondrial complex-I and complex-III were determined in the pure mitochondria. Our results shows that capsaicin inhibits about 2.5–9% and 5–20% of complex-I activity and 8–75% of complex-III activity in BxPC-3 and AsPC-1 cells respectively, which was attenuable by SOD, catalase and EUK-134. On the other hand, capsaicin treatment failed to inhibit complex-I or complex-III activities in normal HPDE-6 cells. The ATP levels were drastically suppressed by capsaicin treatment in both BxPC-3 and AsPC-1 cells and attenuated by catalase or EUK-134. Oxidation of mitochondria-specific cardiolipin was substantially higher in capsaicin treated cells. BxPC-3 derived ρ<sup>0</sup> cells, which lack mitochondrial DNA, were completely resistant to capsaicin mediated ROS generation and apoptosis. Our results reveal that the release of cytochrome c and cleavage of both caspase-9 and caspase-3 due to disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential were significantly blocked by catalase and EUK-134 in BxPC-3 cells. Our results further demonstrate that capsaicin treatment not only inhibit the enzymatic activity and expression of SOD, catalase and glutathione peroxidase but also reduce glutathione level. Over-expression of catalase by transient transfection protected the cells from capsaicin-mediated ROS generation and apoptosis. Furthermore, tumors from mice orally fed with 2.5 mg/kg capsaicin show decreased SOD activity and an increase in GSSG/GSH levels as compared to controls. Taken together, our results suggest the involvement of mitochondrial complex-I and III in capsaicin-mediated ROS generation and decrease in antioxidant levels resulting in severe mitochondrial damage leading to apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Pancreatic cancer is one of the most deadliest of all the solid malignancies in the United States <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Jemal1">[1]</xref>. Efforts have been directed towards the development of adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapies in an attempt to improve survival rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Jemal1">[1]</xref>. Pancreatic cancers generally respond poorly to conventional treatment modalities such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Kelsen1">[2]</xref>. Unfortunately, the toxicity and inherent resistance of chemotherapeutic agent such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer are still reasons for poor prognosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Hartel1">[3]</xref>. There is no consensus regarding optimal therapeutic agents in pancreatic cancer, therefore the development of novel approaches to prevent and treat pancreatic cancer is an important mission. Epidemiological studies continue to support the premise that diet rich in fruits, vegetables and some spices may be protective against various human malignancies including pancreatic cancer and that consumption of chili peppers may protect against gastrointestinal-related cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Satyanarayana1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Block1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Bhutani1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Surh1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Buiatti1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Mozsik1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Kang1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Capsaicin, a homovanillic acid derivative (N-vanillyl-8-methyl-nonenamide) is an active and spicy component of hot chili pepper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Cordell1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Suzuki1">[12]</xref> and has been used as food additive for long time throughout the world, particularly in South Asian and Latin-American countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Yun1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Govindarajan1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Monsereenusorn1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-LopezCarrillo1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Busch1">[17]</xref>.

Several recent studies demonstrated that capsaicin has antiproliferative effect in hepatic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Jung1">[22]</xref> gastric <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Lo1">[23]</xref> prostate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Mori1">[24]</xref> colon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Kim1">[25]</xref> and leukemic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Ito1">[26]</xref>. Capsaicin generally exerts its physiologic response by stimulating vanilloid 1 (TRPV-1) receptor, however, receptor independent effects of capsaicin have been observed in cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Kim1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Ito1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Athanasiou1">[27]</xref>.

The exact molecular mechanism by which capsaicin causes oxidative stress and apoptosis remains vague.

However the exact mechanism by which capsaicin causes ROS generation and cell death was not clear.</p>

      <p>In the present study, we demonstrate that capsaicin causes ROS (superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide) generation by inhibiting mitochondrial complex-I and complex-III activity and ATP levels in BxPC-3 and AsPC-1 human pancreatic cancer cell lines, without affecting BxPC-3 derived ρ<sup>0</sup> and normal HPDE-6 cells. At the same time catalase and glutathione peroxidase activity and expression were suppressed by capsaicin treatment. Supplementing the cells with PEG-catalase, PEG-SOD, EUK-134 (catalase mimick) or transfecting the cells with catalase almost completely blocked capsaicin mediated ROS generation and apoptosis. In addition, tumors from 2.5 mg/kg capsaicin treated mice exhibited decreased SOD activity and an increase in GSSG/GSH level. This study provides a direct evidence of how capsaicin utilizes mitochondria to cause oxidative stress leading to apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells.</p>

        <title>Capsaicin triggers apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells but not in normal HPDE-6 cells</title>
        <p>Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometery using annexin-V/FITC and propidium iodide. Treatment of BxPC-3 and AsPC-1 cells with 150 µM capsaicin for 24 h resulted in about 2.5–5 folds increase in apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g001">Fig. 1B–C</xref>). Interestingly, capsaicin failed to induce apoptosis in normal HPDE-6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). The apoptosis inducing effect of capsaicin was further confirmed by western blotting. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>, capsaicin treatment caused significant activation of caspase-9, caspase-3 and PARP as evident by their respective cleavages in a concentration dependent manner. On the other hand, capsaicin treatment did not caused any cleavages of caspases or PARP in normal HPDE-6 cells (data not shown). In a time dependent study, cleavage of caspase 9/3 and PARP were evident by 16 and 24 h of capsaicin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p>

        <title>Capsaicin causes generation of mitochondrial ROS in pancreatic cancer cells</title>
        <p>Intracellular ROS generation by capsaicin was evaluated by flow cytometry using hydroethidine (HE) and DCFDA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, in a time dependent study, capsaicin treatment caused about 8–9 folds increase in superoxide radical within 1–2 h which decreased by 24 h as measured by HE fluorescence by flow cytometery. Similarly the generation of hydrogen peroxide upon capsaicin treatment increased by 4–7 folds within 1–2 h and then decreased but maintained levels higher than superoxide by 24 h, as measured by DCF fluorescence by flow cytometery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). The generation of ROS was as early as 1 h as compared with controls in BxPC-3 cells. In order to see whether antioxidants can block ROS generation, cells were pretreated with PEG-SOD (100 U/ml), PEG-catalase (500 U/ml) or 50 µM EUK −134 (a cell permeable catalase mimetic) prior to capsaicin treatment. PEG-SOD almost completely blocked superoxide radical generation whereas PEG-catalase completely blocked hydrogen peroxide generation as measured by HE and DCF fluorescence respectively by flow cyometery (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020151.s001">Fig S1A–B</xref>). To confirm the specificity of antioxidants, we used PEG-catalase to block superoxide radical generation. As expected, PEG-catalase completely failed to block superoxide radical generation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020151.s001">Fig S1C</xref>). Similarly, PEG-SOD failed to block hydrogen peroxide generation (data not shown). In subsequent experiments, we measured total ROS (superoxide radical+hydrogen peroxide) generation. Similarly, capsaicin treatment increased total ROS generation by about 2.5–4.5 fold in AsPC-1 cells with maximum at 2 h of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Capsaicin treatment did not cause any significant ROS generation in normal HPDE-6 cells, suggesting that normal cells are resistant to the effects of capsaicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). In a combination treatment, our results indicate that PEG-SOD, PEG-catalase and EUK-134 substantially blocked capsaicin mediated total ROS generation in BxPC-3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>).</p>

        <p>To firmly establish the contribution of mitochondria in ROS generation by capsaicin, we generated the ρ<sup>0</sup> variants of BxPC-3 cells. ρ<sup>0</sup> cells were generated and maintained by incubating BxPC-3 cells with 60 ng/ml ethidium bromide and 50 mg/ml of uridine for 12 weeks and characterized by PCR to confirm the depletion of mtDNA and normal oxidative phosphosrylation as reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Hail2">[35]</xref>.

        <p>Mitochondrial ETC complexes are the major generators of ROS in cells and tissues. Since we observed ROS generation by capsaicin, we wanted to see if mitochondria are involved in this process. We therefore determined the enzymatic activities and expression of mitochondrial complex-I, complex-II, complex-III and complex-IV in capsaicin treated BxPC-3, AsPC-1, HPDE-6 and BxPC-3 ρ<sup>0</sup> cells. Capsaicin treatment inhibits complex-I activity by about 5–20% in BxPC-3 and 2.5–9% in AsPC-1 cells respectively as compared to respective controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g003">Fig. 3A–B</xref>). On the other hand, as expected, capsaicin failed to inhibit complex-I activity in BxPC-3 ρ<sup>0</sup> cells (which lack mitochondrial DNA) and normal HPDE-6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Next, we wanted to investigate whether this decrease in complex-I activity can be attenuated by anti-oxidants. Our results reveal that pretreatment of cells with catalase or EUK-134 substantially blocked the decreases in complex-I activity by capsaicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). Further capsaicin treatment significantly decreased the protein levels of complex-I protein complex after 4 h of treatment in a time dependent study and catalase or EUK-134 prevented this change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g003">Fig. 3E–F</xref>). Similarly, complex-III activity by capsaicin was inhibited by 8–75% in both BxPC-3 and AsPC-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g004">Fig. 4A–B</xref>). Nonetheless, capsaicin failed to decrease complex-III activity in BxPC-3 ρ<sup>0</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). A modest decrease in complex III activity was however observed in HPDE-6 cells by capsaicin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). The decrease in complex-III activity in BxPC-3 cells by capsaicin was attenuated by catalase and EUK-134 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). In agreement with activity data, expression of complex-III protein complex was drastically reduced in BxPC-3 cells following capsaicin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>). The effect of capsaicin on the protein level of complex-III was abrogated by catalase and EUK-134 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>). Our results show that mitochondrial complex-III is more involved in capsaicin mediated ROS generation as compared to complex-I. Capsaicin had no effect on complex-II and IV (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that inhibition of mitochondrial complex I and complex-III by capsaicin cause ROS generation.</p>

        <title>Effect of capsaicin on mitochondrial ATP generation</title>
        <p>Mitochondria are the major source of energy for the cells. We next wanted to know whether capsaicin mediated disruption of mitochondrial respiratory complexes affected ATP generation. To determine the levels of ATP, we evaluated complex-V ATP synthase activity in the mitochondria isolated from control and capsaicin treated BxPC-3 and AsPC-1 cells. The generation of ATP is through complex-V in the mitochondria. Capsaicin treatment depleted ATP levels by about 75% in both BxPC-3 and AsPC-1 cells as compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g005">Fig. 5A–B</xref>). We also observed that catalase and EUK-134 significantly prevented the decline in ATP levels in response to capsaicin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). To further confirm these observations, expression of mitochondrial complex-V protein was determined by western blotting.

This decline in complex-V expression was attenuated by catalase and EUK-134 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>).

        <title>Capsaicin disrupts mitochondrial membrane potential and cause oxidation of mitochondrial lipid</title>
        <p>Excessive intracellular ROS lead the cells to apoptosis by disrupting mitochondrial membrane potential. The change in mitochondrial membrane potential by capsaicin was thus determined by staining the cell with mitochondrial membrane sensitive dye TMRM and analyzed by flow cytometry. We found that capsaicin treatment significantly decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential in BxPC-3 cells by 26% as compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). To confirm whether capsaicin mediated ROS causes change in mitochondrial membrane potential, catalase and EUK-134 were used. Pretreatment of cells with both antioxidants followed by capsaicin completely prevented the drop in mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). We further examined the possibility whether capsaicin preferentially induce mitochondrial lipid peroxidation in BxPC-3 cells. For this purpose, cells were stained with nonyl acridine orange (NAO) to detect oxidation of cardiolipin, a mitochondrial membrane lipid component, by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Trachootham1">[37]</xref>. Cardiolipin is exclusively present in mitochondria and after being labeled with NAO and exhibits yellow fluorescence. When we analyzed our cells under the fluorescent microscope, we observed that almost all the cells from control group were exhibiting yellow color. However, the yellow staining decreased and turned into green in capsaicin treated cells indicating drastic oxidation of cardiolipin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). Nonetheless, catalase and EUK-134 completely prevented the oxidation of cardiolipin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). These results were confirmed by flow cytometry where we observed that capsaicin causes cardiolipin oxidation in BxPC-3 cells as shown by a shift of NAO fluorescence towards left (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). We further used catalase and EUK-134 to see whether the oxidation of cardiolipin can be prevented. We found that addition of catalase or EUK-134 almost completely blocked the shift of NAO staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>) suggesting that the decrease of NAO fluorescence was due to oxidation of mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin by mitochondrial ROS.</p>

        <title>Capsaicin-induced apoptosis is attenuable by anti-oxidants</title>
        <p>We observed that capsaicin causes ROS generation by disrupting mitochondrial function. Once mitochondrial functions are disrupted, cytochrome-c is released from the mitochondria into the cytosol and activate caspase-3 cascade leading the cells into apoptosis. We wondered whether catalase and EUK-134 could abrogate capsaicin induced apoptosis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>, PEG-SOD, PEG-catalase and EUK-134 significantly protected BxPC-3 cells from capsaicin induced apoptosis.

        <title>Capsaicin treatment disrupts cellular redox homeostasis resulting in oxidative stress</title>
        <p>Redox homeostasis in a cell is due to a fine balance between the intracellular ROS and ROS scavenging antioxidants and enzyme systems. Reduced GSH is an intracellular antioxidant and is known to maintain cellular redox balance. We therefore measured intracellular GSH levels and also determined the levels of oxidized form of GSH (GSSG). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>, capsaicin treatment significantly increased GSSG levels; and decreased GSH levels indicating the shift of redox equilibrium towards pro-oxidant state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g008">Fig. 8A–B</xref>). The other enzyme systems which play role in redox balance include superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Superoxide radicals are generated by complex-I and complex-III of the mitochondria and are rapidly converted into hydrogen peroxide due to dismutation by superoxide dismutase. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g008">Fig. 8C</xref>, capsaicin treatment inhibited 23–51% SOD activity in a time-dependent study. The other two enzymes (catalase and GPx) are involved in detoxifying intracellular peroxides including hydrogen peroxide. Our results demonstrate that capsaicin significantly reduced the enzymatic activity of catalase within 2 h of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g008">Fig. 8D</xref>). These observations were confirmed by catalase protein expression. We observed that catalase expression was decreased after 2 h of capsaicin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g008">Fig. 8 D–E</xref>). Throughout our studies, we observed that catalase or EUK-134 supplementation prevented ROS generation and protected the cells from the deleterious effects of capsaicin, clearly indicating that catalase plays a critical role in capsaicin mediated oxidative stress and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells. Since glutathione peroxidase is another important enzyme that utilizes GSH as a substrate to detoxify hydrogen peroxide, we determined its enzymatic activity and protein expression. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020151-g008">Fig. 8 F–G</xref>, capsaicin reduced GPx activity and expression in BxPC-3 cells in response to capsaicin treatment. In fact, the expression of GPx was significantly reduced just after 1 h of capsaicin treatment. Taken together, our results suggest that depletion of GSH level and inhibition of SOD, catalase and GPx by capsaicin disturbs the cellular redox homeostasis resulting in increased oxidative stress.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Mitochondria are a major physiological source of ROS, which are generated due to incomplete reduction of oxygen during normal mitochondrial respiration. Excessive ROS that are generated under certain pathological conditions acts as mediator of apoptotic signaling pathway. Under normal physiological conditions, mitochondria contain sufficient levels of antioxidants that prevent ROS generation and oxidative damage. However, under circumstances in which excessive mitochondrial ROS are produced or when antioxidant levels are depleted, oxidative damage to mitochondria occurs. Our current results shows that capsaicin induced apoptosis in BxPC-3 and AsPC-1 cells but not in HPDE-6 cells was associated with ROS generation. The ROS generation by capsaicin was due to marked inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) complexes-I and III and downregulation of antioxidants such as GSH, catalase, SOD and GPx indicating the involvement of mitochondria. On the other hand, ρ<sup>0</sup> cells derived from BxPC-3 cells, which lack normal oxidative phosphorylation were unable to cause ROS generation and were totally resistant to the apoptosis inducing effects of capsaicin.</p>
      <p>Mitochondrial ETC has been recognized as the major intracellular source of reactive oxygen species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Xiao1">[38]</xref>. Complex-I and complex-III of ETC are the major sites for ROS generation. The present study provides convincing experimental data to prove that ROS generation by capsaicin in pancreatic cancer cells is through ETC complex-I and complex-III and not through complex-II and IV. Capsaicin (150 µM, 24 h) treatment cause significant decrease in ETC complex-I and complex-III activities in BxPC-3 and AsPC-1 cells but not in normal HPDE-6 cells. To confirm whether capsaicin mediated ROS were mitochondria derived; we generated BxPC-3 ρ<sup>0</sup> cells in which mitochondrial DNA is depleted. The BxPC-3 ρ<sup>0</sup> cells were completely resistant to ROS generation and apoptosis induced by capsaicin as compared with wild type BxPC-3 cells suggesting that a functional electron transport chain is required for capsaicin mediated ROS generation. These results are consistent with previous studies where ETC complexes were involved in ROS generation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Xiao1">[38]</xref>. However, in contrast to those studies where whole cell lysate was used to determine ETC complex activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Xiao1">[38]</xref>, we used pure mitochondria from control and capsaicin treated cells to evaluate ETC activity. ROS once generated cause oxidation of critical redox sensitive proteins and lipids leading to mitochondrial damage. Our results clearly show that capsaicin treatment, cause massive oxidation of cardiolipin, which is specifically present in the mitochondria. Mitochondrial damage due to oxidation of cardiolipin has been documented in a recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Trachootham1">[37]</xref>. Cytochrome c preferentially binds to cardiolipin and is liberated upon oxidation of cardiolipin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Nomura1">[39]</xref>. In agreement, our results show the release of cytochrome c into cytosol by capsaicin treatment, which could be due to cardiolipin oxidation. Our results also demonstrate massive depletion of ATP as evaluated by complex-V ATP synthase activity. ETC complex forms a transmembrane potential (Δψ). ATP synthase uses potential energy stored in Δψ to phosphorylate ADP. However, under certain pathological conditions, the Δψ can collapse resulting in the release of molecules from the mitochondria into the cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Zhang1">[34]</xref>. Our result do show decrease in Δψ and release of cytochrome c into the cytosol in response to capsaicin treatment. Further, ATP production was shown to be highly sensitive to complex-III inhibition in a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Wen1">[40]</xref>. In agreement, our results also show a relationship between complex III inhibition and ATP depletion.</p>
      <p>Cellular redox homeostasis is maintained by a fine balance between antioxidants and pro-oxidants. Glutathione is a critical intracellular antioxidant responsible for maintaining redox balance. GSH can be oxidized to form GSSG and the ratio of GSH/GSSG is an indicator of oxidative stress in the cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Trachootham1">[37]</xref>. High concentrations of GSSG can oxidatively damage many critical enzymes. Our results reveal that capsaicin treatment caused time dependent increase in the levels of GSSG and decrease in GSH levels in BxPC-3 cells. Similar observations were made in the tumors of capsaicin treated mice as compared to the tumors from control mice. The GSSG levels increased and GSH level decreased hence the ratio of GSSG/GSH increased in the tumors of capsaicin treated mice. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an enzyme responsible for dismutating superoxide radicals, which are generated in the mitochondria by ETC complex I and complex III. Over-expression of SOD has been shown in lung tumors as compared to normal tissues suggesting its role in lung carcinogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-ChungmanHo1">[41]</xref>. Moreover, SOD was recently identified as a target for the selective killing of cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Huang1">[42]</xref>. Our results clearly show that capsaicin treatment significantly decreased SOD activity in BxPC-3 cells and AsPC-1 tumor xenografts. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) is an important enzyme that utilizes GSH as a substrate to detoxify intracellular peroxides including hydrogen peroxide. Capsaicin treatment resulted in the significant inhibition of GPx activity and expression in BxPC-3 cells. These results indicate that capsaicin deplete GSH level and inhibit GSH dependent anti-oxidant enzymes resulting in the accumulation of ROS in pancreatic cancer cells leading to mitochondrial damage. In addition catalase is another important enzyme which is responsible for detoxifying hydrogen peroxide to water. Consistently, we observed that PEG-SOD, PEG-catalase, catalase or EUK-134 (a cell permeable catalase mimetic) prevented capsaicin mediated ROS generation by complex-I and complex-III, ATP depletion, mitochondrial damage and apoptosis, indicating the involvement of catalase. As a proof-of-concept, over-expression of catalase by transient transfection completely blocked capsaicin mediated ROS generation and apoptosis in BxPC-3 cells demonstrating its critical role in the survival of pancreatic cancer cells.</p>
      <p>Most of the cancer cells have higher levels of ROS that helps in proliferation and cell growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Trachootham1">[37]</xref>. Due to elevated ROS, cancer cells are highly dependent on their antioxidant system to maintain redox balance and hence are more susceptible to further oxidative stress. In contrast, normal cells are more resistant to oxidative stress due to the fact that these cells have lower levels of ROS and increased levels of antioxidants. Hence any agent that increases intracellular ROS in cancer cells may increase ROS to a toxic level resulting in mitochondrial damage and cell death as shown in our model. It is noteworthy that several agents such as Elesclomol or Trisenx are currently being used for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and acute promyelocytic leukemia respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Toogood1">[43]</xref>. Both of these agents selectively kill cancer cells by increasing ROS generation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Toogood1">[43]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We and others have shown previously that administration of 2.5 or 5 mg/kg capsaicin orally or subcutaneously suppress pancreatic and prostate tumor xenografts <italic>in vivo</italic> respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Zhang1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-Sanchez1">[44]</xref> . In the present study, 2.5 mg/kg capsaicin was given to mice by oral gavage, which is 0.202 mg/kg when converted to human equivalent dose (HED) and equates to 13.2 mg dose of capsaicin for a 60 kg person <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020151-ReaganShaw1">[45]</xref>. However, further pharmacokinetic, bioavailability and clinical studies are needed to validate these correlations.</p>
      <p>Taken together our studies provide detailed mechanism how capsaicin treatment causes ROS generation through mitochondria and depleted intracellular antioxidants resulting in mitochondrial damage and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells. On the other hand, normal pancreatic epithelial cells were resistant to the effects of capsaicin.</p>

Catalase activity is based on the reaction of the enzyme with methanol in the presence of an optimal concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The formaldehyde produced is measured colorimetrically at 540 nm with 4-amino-3-hydrozino-5-mercapto-1, 2, 4-triazole as the chromogen which upon oxidation changes from colorless to a purple color. SOD activity kit utilizes tetrazolium salt for detection of superoxide radicals generated by xanthine oxidase and hypoxanthine. One unit of SOD is defined as the amount of enzyme needed to exhibit 50% dismutation of the superoxide radical. The SOD assay kit measures combined activity of Cu/Zn, Mn, and Fe-SOD. GPx activity measures the rate of NADPH oxidation to NADP<sup>+</sup>, which is accompanied by a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. One GPx unit is directly proportional to the amount of NADPH consumed in nmol per minute at 23–25°C and pH 7.6.
