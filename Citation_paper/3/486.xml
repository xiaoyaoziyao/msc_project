        <p>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by defective mucociliary clearance and chronic airway infection by a complex microbiota. Infection, persistent inflammation and periodic episodes of acute pulmonary exacerbation contribute to an irreversible decline in CF lung function. While the factors leading to acute exacerbations are poorly understood, antibiotic treatment can temporarily resolve pulmonary symptoms and partially restore lung function. Previous studies indicated that exacerbations may be associated with changes in microbial densities and the acquisition of new microbial species. Given the complexity of the CF microbiota, we applied massively parallel pyrosequencing to identify changes in airway microbial community structure in 23 adult CF patients during acute pulmonary exacerbation, after antibiotic treatment and during periods of stable disease. Over 350,000 sequences were generated, representing nearly 170 distinct microbial taxa. Approximately 60% of sequences obtained were from the recognized CF pathogens <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia</italic>, which were detected in largely non-overlapping patient subsets. In contrast, other taxa including <italic>Prevotella</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, <italic>Rothia</italic> and <italic>Veillonella</italic> were abundant in nearly all patient samples. Although antibiotic treatment was associated with a small decrease in species richness, there was minimal change in overall microbial community structure. Furthermore, microbial community composition was highly similar in patients during an exacerbation and when clinically stable, suggesting that exacerbations may represent intrapulmonary spread of infection rather than a change in microbial community composition. Mouthwash samples, obtained from a subset of patients, showed a nearly identical distribution of taxa as expectorated sputum, indicating that aspiration may contribute to colonization of the lower airways. Finally, we observed a strong correlation between low species richness and poor lung function. Taken together, these results indicate that the adult CF lung microbiome is largely stable through periods of exacerbation and antibiotic treatment and that short-term compositional changes in the airway microbiota do not account for CF pulmonary exacerbations.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a hereditary disease characterized by defective mucociliary clearance and airway obstruction by dehydrated, mucopurulent secretions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Boyle1">[1]</xref>. The leading cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with CF is respiratory failure associated with persistent airway infection and inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Dodge1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Vandenbranden1">[4]</xref>. Traditional aerobic culture-based studies, of spontaneous expectorated sputa, indicate that CF airway infection involves a relatively small collection of opportunistic pathogens that are typically acquired in a temporal succession, beginning early in life with <italic>Haemophilus influen</italic>zae and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and culminating in chronic infections dominated by <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> or <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic> complex species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Razvi1">[5]</xref>. Additional opportunistic pathogens, including <italic>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</italic>, <italic>Achromobacter xylosoxidans</italic> and nontuberculous <italic>mycobacterium</italic> have been recovered from adult patients with increasing frequency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-LiPuma1">[6]</xref>. The observation that the mucous obstructing CF airways is hypoxic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Worlitzsch1">[7]</xref> has led to multiple studies in which CF respiratory specimens have been analyzed under strict anaerobic culture conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Tunney1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Worlitzsch2">[10]</xref>. These studies have shown that anaerobic bacterial species are also present within CF airways in high numbers. The spectrum of facultative and obligate anaerobic species recovered from CF specimens frequently includes members of the genera <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, <italic>Prevotella</italic>, <italic>Actinomyces</italic> and <italic>Veillonella</italic>. The use of culture independent molecular detection methods has greatly expanded our understanding of the complexity of CF airway disease. High throughput sequencing efforts indicate that the CF microbiome consists of more than 60 different bacterial genera, while interrogation of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene-based phylogenetic microarrays has placed the estimate at as many as 43 different bacterial phyla and over 2,000 different taxa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Willner1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Cox1">[13]</xref>.</p>

      <p>Despite the complexity and variety of microbial organisms that can reside in the airways of CF patients, individuals can exhibit relatively extended periods of stable disease symptoms. These stable periods are punctuated by episodes of acute pulmonary exacerbation. While the definition of a pulmonary exacerbation is controversial, it generally involves a rapid decline in pulmonary function and worsening of respiratory symptoms, requiring antibiotic treatment and hospitalization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Flume1">[14]</xref>. Patients who experience more frequent exacerbations have increased morbidity and mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Goldbeck1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-deBoer1">[16]</xref>.

        <p>Spontaneous expectorated sputum samples were collected from 23 adult CF patients at the onset of a clinically diagnosed exacerbation and following the completion of treatment with intravenous antibiotics. Enrollment and characterization of the patient cohort, was described as part of a previous clinical study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Tunney1">[8]</xref>. Three of the patients were treated twice for an exacerbation resulting in a total of 26-matched exacerbation/end-of-treatment sample pairs. A wide range of antibiotic regimens was employed to treat exacerbations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0045001-t001">Table 1</xref>). The antibiotic combinations used in this study were primarily selected to target known pathogens such as <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>B. cepacia</italic>; however, all of the regimens are expected to have broad-spectrum activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, the majority of patients also received oral azithromycin or inhaled colistin or tobramycin as chronic maintenance therapy. Sputum was also collected from 13 of these patients when clinically stable with 7 samples collected prior to exacerbation, 5 samples collected post-exacerbation, and one sample collected between treatment of two separate exacerbations.</p>

        <p>To determine whether changes in CF airway microbial community structure are associated with exacerbation and antibiotic treatment, total microbial community DNA was isolated from expectorated sputum samples and subjected to 454 pyrosequencing targeting the V1–V2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. After quality control filtering (see Methods), the average number of sequences per sample was approximately 4,300 and all samples produced a minimum of 2,292 sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0045001.s001">Table S1</xref>). Using version 2 of AbundantOTU <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Ye1">[27]</xref>, we identified a total of 169 non-chimeric microbial Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) at 97% identity in the CF sputum sample set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0045001.s002">Tables S2</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0045001.s005">S5</xref>).

Only two OTUs shared less than 95% identity with a previously deposited reference sequence, indicating that nearly all of the taxa encountered in our CF patient cohort were previously detected in other sequencing projects. Furthermore, the high level of sequence identify between the OTU sequences generated here and full-length 16S rRNA reference sequences demonstrates a low overall rate of sequencing error and that the quality control pipeline used was sufficient for removing sequencing artifacts.</p>

        <p>To determine whether there was quantitative agreement between the two methods, we directly compared total viable counts (TVC) as determined by culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Tunney1">[8]</xref> and relative sequence abundance determined by pyrosequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Linear regression between TVC and relative sequence abundance were highly significant for both <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, black line; r<sup>2</sup> = 0.71, p&lt;0.001) and <italic>Burkholderia</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, black line; r<sup>2</sup> = 0.86, p&lt;0.001), demonstrating general agreement between the methods. Despite this agreement, visual inspection of the data suggest that the relationship between TVC and relative sequence abundance may be better characterized by a saturating non-linear model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g004">Figure 4</xref>; red lines). This non-linear relationship is presumably due to the inherent difference between relative and absolute abundance measures. For example, when the majority of sequences in a sample are already assigned to a given taxon, a further increase in the absolute abundance of that taxon cannot be reflected by a proportionate increase in the relative sequence abundance. For this reason, changes of more than an order of magnitude for TVC for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>B. cepacia</italic> are not necessarily reflected in large changes in relative sequence abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Regardless of the saturation effect seen for numerically dominant species, this comparison between TVC and pyrosequencing indicates that relative sequence abundance is a reliable means for characterizing microbial community structure and changes in species diversity or richness following antibiotic disturbance.</p>

        <title>Antibiotic treatment reduces low abundance taxa, but has minimal impact on overall CF microbial community structure</title>
        <p>While a number of recent studies have described the CF airway microbiome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Tunney1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Guss1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Cox1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-vanderGast1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Sibley3">[31]</xref>, none have examined the short-term longitudinal impact of exacerbation and antibiotic treatment on a large patient population. The results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g003">Figure 3</xref> suggest that there is general stability of the dominant pathogens as measured by sequencing at the onset of exacerbation, following antibiotic treatment (end-of-treatment) and during stable intervals. Notably, samples taken at the end-of-treatment timepoint did not consistently show a lower fraction of sequences assigned to <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> or <italic>Burkholderia</italic> compared to samples taken either at the onset of exacerbation or when patients were clinically stable. To determine whether other less abundant members of the microbial community are affected by antibiotic treatment, we compared the normalized average sequence abundance for all taxa at the onset of exacerbation and at the end-of-treatment with intravenous antibiotics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0045001.s006">Table S6</xref>). The relative sequence abundance of the individual OTUs was broadly similar at these two timepoints, indicating that antibiotic treatment did not have a dramatic affect on overall community structure. To determine whether the relative abundance of specific taxa was impacted, we tested the null hypothesis that the distribution of sequence reads for each OTU was the same at the exacerbation and end-of-treatment timepoints (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0045001.s006">Table S6</xref>). At a 10% false discovery rate, we found that the relative sequence abundance of only 7 OTUs (<italic>Gemella</italic>, 2 <italic>Pasteurella</italic> OTUs, 2 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> OTUs, <italic>Oribacterium</italic> and <italic>Neisseria</italic>; indicated by red symbols in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) was higher at the beginning of an exacerbation than at the end-of-treatment. With regard to CF airway microbial communities, this result suggests that antibiotic treatment may have a greater impact on a small number of less abundant taxa.</p>

        <p>Twelve different broad-spectrum antibiotic regimens were used to treat the 26 exacerbations characterized in this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0045001-t001">Table 1</xref>). To determine if specific antibiotic combinations had a differential impact on the airway microbiome, we compared the two largest treatment groups (Tobramycin and ceftzidime versus Tobramycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) and found no significant differences in microbial community structure (data not shown). The small sample size for the remaining treatment regimens precluded further statistical comparisons.</p>
        <p>To determine whether specific taxa were associated with the onset of exacerbation, we compared the distribution of the sequence reads for each OTU at the beginning of exacerbation and stable timepoints. The pattern of OTUs was highly similar between these timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). The only obvious outlier in this relationship was <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, black arrow); however, the difference in the distribution of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sequence counts between exacerbation and stable timepoints was not statistically significant (paired t-test; p = 0.13, n = 13).</p>
        <p>Visual inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g005">Figure 5A</xref> shows that there is a higher number of taxa under the identity line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, red line) than over the identity line, suggesting that antibiotic treatment may affect specific taxa in a patient dependent or antibiotic dependent manner that is not apparent in the aggregate data. To further investigate the possibility of patient specific changes in microbial community structure, we calculated richness (the number of taxa present) within each sample. Richness was lower at the end-of-treatment timepoint than at other timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), although this difference did not reach statistical significance (paired t-test, p = 0.06). Despite this trend towards lower richness, the overall similarity of the distributions of taxa between the exacerbation and end-of-treatment timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g005">Figure 5C</xref>) demonstrates that antibiotic treatment does not lead to wholesale restructuring of the microbial community.</p>

        <title>Infection types, defined by the dominant CF pathogens <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia</italic>, are not associated with distinct microbial communities</title>
        <p>A previous study partitioned the CF airway microbiome into core and satellite taxa, as a means to distinguish microbial species that are present in nearly all CF patients from those that display a more variable distribution among patients, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-vanderGast1">[29]</xref>. The authors observed a positive correlation between the number of patients that harbored a given taxon and the mean abundance of that taxon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-vanderGast1">[29]</xref>. This relationship was also apparent in our patient cohort, where the average number of sequences for each taxon shows a positive linear correlation (Kendall rank correlation; p = 3.12×10<sup>−05</sup>) with the number of samples in which that taxon is present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g006">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0045001.s007">Table S7</xref>). In other words, high abundance in one sample is an indicator that a taxon is likely to be prevalent in the patient cohort.</p>
        <p>The two most obvious outliers in this relationship are the OTUs assigned to <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia</italic>, which appear to have a very different distribution from other taxa in our study; they are highly abundant when present, but are only detected in largely non-overlapping patient subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that microbial community structure involves complex interactions between the constituent members and that overall community composition is impacted by numerically dominant species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Sibley2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Sibley4">[35]</xref>. Since <italic>Burkholderia</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> account for the majority of all the sequences observed in this study, and the presence of <italic>Burkholderia</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> tends to be mutually exclusive in our dataset, we predicted that the presence of these organisms would have a differential impact on the composition of their respective microbial communities. To determine whether distinct community structures existed within our patient population, we performed a principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) of all sputum samples. Replacing the relative abundance data for each OTU with the first two principal coordinates resulted in a clear separation of the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia</italic> dominated communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g007">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0045001-t002">Table 2</xref>). To determine if these differences were reflected in taxa other than <italic>Burkholderia</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, we repeated the PCoA after excluding all <italic>Burkholderia</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sequences. When the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia</italic> sequences were removed, nearly all of the distinctions between the microbial communities were lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g007">Figure 7B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0045001-t002">Table 2</xref>). Moreover, when we tested the null hypothesis that a given taxon is differentially represented in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> or <italic>Burkholderia</italic> dominated communities, only the two <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> OTUs and one <italic>Burkholderia</italic> OTU were detected at a 10% false discovery rate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0045001.s008">Table S8</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia</italic> infections occur against a relatively stable background of other members of the microbial community.</p>

As was the case when we examined each OTU individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g005">Figure 5</xref>), PCoA analysis revealed a measurable but transient effect of antibiotics on the end-of-treatment samples, while the exacerbation and stable timepoints were largely indistinguishable. Taken together, these results emphasize the resilience of the microbial community and the short-term effects of antibiotic treatment.</p>
        <p>Likewise, samples taken at different timepoints from the same individual tended to cluster more closely over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g007">Figure 7E–F</xref>), and this clustering is apparent whether or not sequences from <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia</italic> are included (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0045001-t002">Table 2</xref>). Because each patient was defined by bacterial culture as either <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>- or <italic>Burkholderia</italic>-positive, patient ID is confounded by culture results. To avoid this problem, we analyzed the <italic>Pseudomonas-</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia</italic>-positive patient groups separately. Despite the limited sample size for the two infection types (<italic>Pseudomonas</italic>-positive, n = 14; <italic>Burkholderia</italic>-positive, n = 8), we were able to reject the null hypothesis that individual patients have distinct microbiomes over time, for at least one principle coordinate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0045001-t002">Table 2</xref>). The finding that individuals have unique microbiomes is consistent with other studies that have shown a distinct individual signature that is maintained over longitudinal sampling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Spencer1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Wu1">[37]</xref>.</p>

        <title>CF airway and oral microbial communities are highly similar</title>
        <p>Numerous studies have noted that the majority of facultative and obligate anaerobes detected in CF respiratory samples are typically associated with the normal human oral microbiota <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Sibley2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-vanderGast1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Harris1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Maeda1">[38]</xref>. The use of careful sampling methods and the apparent density of these organisms in sputum strongly suggest that their presence is not explained by sputum contamination with saliva <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Harris1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Rogers1">[39]</xref>. To examine the overlap between the CF airway and oral microbiota and to better characterize the contribution of oral flora in CF airway infection, we collected mouthwash samples for a subset of 9 CF patients at different timepoints (n = 22 samples) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0045001.s001">Table S1</xref>). To characterize the oral microbiota, total microbial DNA was extracted from mouthwash samples and was sequenced and analyzed in parallel with the corresponding sputum samples (see Methods). With few exceptions (most notably <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>), the average relative abundance of taxa observed in the mouthwash samples was highly similar to that observed in sputum samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g008">Figure 8</xref>). At a 10% false discovery rate, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test detected only two OTUs (<italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Rothia</italic>) that showed a different distribution between mouthwash and sputum; with <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> being more abundant in sputum and <italic>Rothia</italic> more prevalent in mouthwash (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0045001.s009">Table S9</xref>). A parametric t-test recovers six additional OTUs classified as <italic>Granulicatella</italic> (2 OTUs) and <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (four OTUs) that show a higher relative abundance in mouthwash compared to sputum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0045001.s009">Table S9</xref>). It is important to note, however, that our sample size is small (with mouthwash samples from only 9 individual patients). It is likely that a survey with a larger sample size could detect more taxa that are different between mouthwash and sputum. Within the limits of our sample size, however, our results indicate an underlying CF airway microbiome that is largely reflective of the oral cavity.</p>

        <title>Microbial richness shows significant correlations with patient clinical status</title>
        <p>Recent studies using both Sanger sequencing and 454 pyrosequencing methods have found a relationship between reduced species diversity (as measured by richness or Shannon diversity) and reduced respiratory function (as measured by FEV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-vanderGast1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Zhao1">[40]</xref>. We have shown that a two-week course of intravenous antibiotics only modestly diminishes the richness of CF airway microbial communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), and that this effect is temporary, with richness similar at exacerbation and stable timepoints. As richness is broadly stable across time, we calculated an average richness for each patient by pooling all samples associated with the patient. Average richness, calculated in this way, correlated well (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.42, p = 0.0009) with FEV<sub>1</sub>, a broad measure of the respiratory function, in our cross-sectional analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Our results are, therefore, in agreement with the existing literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-vanderGast1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Zhao1">[40]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We also determined if total microbial abundance was similarly correlated with FEV<sub>1</sub>. Microbial abundance was previously calculated for all samples in this study by determining TVC by culture and by qPCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Tunney1">[8]</xref>. While these two metrics correlate well with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g010">Figure 10A</xref>; r<sup>2</sup> = 0.63, p&lt;0.0001), neither TVC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g010">Figure 10B</xref>; r<sup>2</sup> = 0.017, p = 0.55) or qPCR data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g010">Figure 10C</xref>; r<sup>2</sup> = 0.003, p = 0.8) correlated with FEV<sub>1</sub>. When we only examined TVC associated with <italic>B. cepacia</italic> complex species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g010">Figure 10D</xref>; r<sup>2</sup> = 0.29, p = 0.13) or <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g010">Figure 10E</xref>; r<sup>2</sup> = 0.26, p = 0.05), there was at best a modest correlation with FEV<sub>1</sub>. Therefore, we conclude that microbial richness is a better predictor of FEV<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g009">Figure 9</xref>) than measures of total microbial abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g010">Figure 10</xref>). This is also consistent with a previous study in which total bacterial density remained constant over time despite changes in diversity that were associated with decreased lung function as measured by FEV<sub>1</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Zhao1">[40]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Given the similarity between the oral microbiota and airway microbiota described above, we determined whether reduced FEV<sub>1</sub> was reflected in reduced diversity in the oral microbiota. Similar to sputum samples, the average richness of microbial species detected in mouthwash samples from the nine CF patients showed a modest correlation with lung function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g011">Figure 11</xref>; r<sup>2</sup> = 0.42, p = 0.057); however, the correlation did not reach the threshold of statistical significance. Given the small sample size, this observation suggests that a larger study of diversity in CF patient mouthwash samples is warranted. Despite the limited number of mouthwash samples examined, these results suggest that CF lung function may correlate with microbial diversity at multiple body sites.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Within the CF patients in our cohort, we observed a largely stable overall structure of the airway microbial community, despite antibiotic treatment and changes in disease status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g005">Figure 5</xref>). For the 23 patients included in this study, we observed many species belonging to the genera <italic>Streptococcus, Prevotella</italic>, <italic>Rothia</italic>, <italic>Veillonella</italic>, <italic>Actinomyces</italic>, and <italic>Granulicatella</italic> and a single numerically dominant pathogen, either <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> or <italic>Burkholderia</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g002">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g003">3</xref>). With few exceptions, the taxa reported here are well represented in Sanger-based sequencing and culture-based CF studies, suggesting that the adult CF microbial community has a distinct signature that can be successfully detected with multiple technologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Tunney1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Tunney2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Guss1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-vanderGast1">[29]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Recent studies have emphasized the successional progression and loss of microbial diversity as a function of CF patient age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Cox1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-KlepacCeraj1">[30]</xref>. Our study suggests that at the end point of this succession, poor lung function is associated with a low-diversity community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g009">Figure 9</xref>) that it is largely resistant to changes in the face of antibiotic treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Similar findings have recently been reported for patients with COPD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-ErbDownward1">[41]</xref>. Sampling of either expectorated sputum or mouthwash largely reflects the same microbes, with the possible exception of dominant aerobic airway pathogens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Interestingly, while loss of species richness is associated with decreased lung function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g009">Figure 9</xref>), we did not find a significant relationship between total abundance of bacteria and decreased lung function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g010">Figure 10</xref>). Further, our data generally do not support either intensification or the overgrowth of a particular pathogen or the acquisition of new microbial community members as the cause of acute exacerbations in this patient cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This is consistent with a recently published study that observed total bacterial density remaining stable in CF patients even as FEV deteriorated over time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Zhao1">[40]</xref>. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that exacerbation represents the spread of infection to previously unaffected airways. Alternatively, exacerbation may be the consequence of further adaptations of the microbial community to the airway environment such as a change in the expression of virulence traits by one or more species within the community. For example, during chronic CF airway infection, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> can undergo conversion from a smooth to mucoid colony phenotype, due to over production of the capsular polysaccharide alginate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Govan1">[42]</xref>. Mucoid conversion within the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> population is associated with a host hyperimmune response and a more rapid decline in lung function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Li1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Pedersen1">[44]</xref>. Future studies will be necessary to determine whether exacerbation involves the spread of infection or a change in the behavior of the microbial community.</p>
      <p>The finding that microbial community composition did not substantively change with antibiotic treatment is perhaps surprising given that the majority of these patients were treated for two weeks with a combination of broad-spectrum antibiotics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0045001-t001">Table 1</xref>). While there was a small decrease in richness following antibiotic treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), the changes appear to be largely limited to taxa that were already of low relative abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Moreover, change in OTU relative abundance following antibiotic treatments was statistically significant in only a small number of taxa at a 10% false discovery rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g005">Figure 5A</xref>; red symbols). While a larger sample size might detect significant changes in more taxa, it is clear that the most abundant taxa in this cohort (including <italic>Prevotella</italic>, <italic>Actinomyces</italic>, <italic>Granulicatella</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, <italic>Burkholderia</italic>, <italic>Veillonella</italic>, <italic>Rothia</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>) showed little change in response to antibiotics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). This observation may be due to the fact that antibiotic resistance is widespread throughout many abundant members of the microbiota cultured from the sputum of adult CF patients including <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>B. cepacia</italic> complex species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Emerson1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Peeters1">[47]</xref>. As the cost of whole genome sequencing continues drop, it will be interesting to see if the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in each of these taxa can be located and if the acquisition of resistance elements can be followed longitudinally in individual patients as they age.</p>
      <p>One limitation of our results is that they are dependent on a quantitative interpretation of high-throughput pyrosequencing data. While next generation sequencing has generated an unprecedented, detailed view of microbial communities within the human body, current PCR-based technology is prone to saturation effects. Since the CF microbial community can be dominated by a relatively small number of pathogens, these saturation artifacts may be more pronounced than in other polymicrobial diseases. We observed that the agreement between culture and relative sequence abundance is best described by a non-linear model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Moreover, absolute measures of abundance, such as TVC and qPCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene, show a small, but statistically significant, response to antibiotics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Tunney1">[8]</xref>; whereas, our relative sequence counts largely show stability of microbial community structure in response to antibiotics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The differences between the two methods may be due to the inherent differences between relative and absolute measurements of abundance. For many of the samples in which <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> or <italic>Burkholderia</italic> were detected, their associated sequences represent more than 50% of the reads in the sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Under these conditions, further large increases in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> or <italic>Burkholderia</italic> would not be detected by sequencing as the majority of sequences are already assigned to these dominant pathogens. While pyrosequencing may not detect changes in absolute density of numerically dominant microbial community members, the fact that we detected a similar distribution of taxa in sputum and mouthwash samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g008">Figure 8</xref>), which harbor substantially fewer dominant pathogens, strongly suggests that the observed overall community structure is not a result of saturation artifacts.</p>
      <p>In the present study, mouthwash and spontaneous sputum samples had a very similar distribution of taxa, with the exception of the pathogens <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g008">Figure 8</xref>) and a small number of other taxa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0045001.s009">Table S9</xref>). This finding is similar to that recently reported for healthy individuals where bacterial communities from the lung displayed compositions indistinguishable from the upper airways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Charlson1">[48]</xref>. A number of studies have clearly shown that detection in sputum of bacteria, which are members of the normal oral microbiota, is not a result of contamination of the sputum sample during collection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Tunney2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Rogers1">[39]</xref>. Furthermore, these bacteria are also present in low numbers in the lungs of healthy individuals, healthy smokers and patients with other respiratory diseases characterized by chronic infection such as COPD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-ErbDownward1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Charlson1">[48]</xref>. Therefore, our findings suggest that the oral cavity could serve as a reservoir for respiratory infection with sputum seeded during small-volume aspiration.</p>
      <p>Members of complex microbial communities are known to exhibit both mutualistic and antagonist relationships. Therefore, it is reasonable that we would detect different microbial community organization in patients who had a <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> dominated infection compared to patients with a <italic>Burkholderia</italic> dominated infection. However, our data do not support this hypothesis. When we remove <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia</italic> sequences from our data set, the underlying microbial community structures were largely indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g007">Figure 7B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0045001-t002">Table 2</xref>). Moreover, with the exception of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia</italic>, taxa that are present in a large number of patients also tend to be present in the highest abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia</italic> infections occur in the context of a highly stable microbial community that is on average, broadly similar across patients. <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia</italic> are closely related organisms and it may be that they can play similar ecological roles in the communities in which they exist. Alternatively, the underlying microbial community, which may be continually reseeded by aspiration from the oral cavity, may only support or select for a subset of non-endogenous opportunistic pathogens with a related metabolic capacity.</p>
      <p>In summary, we have observed a surprising degree of stability in microbial community composition across sample types and before and after antibiotic treatment of adult patients infected with a range of opportunistic pathogens. Taken together with recent successional studies that have documented higher diversity in children with CF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Cox1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-KlepacCeraj1">[30]</xref>, our study supports a model of CF in which a diverse but unstable microbial community associated with children is reduced to a smaller set of highly resistant taxa in adults that are stable across time and space. This model is consistent with the recent observation that lifetime exposure to antibiotics in CF patients is associated with lower FEV and lower microbial diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Zhao1">[40]</xref>. Our data further suggest that the loss of lung function associated with acute exacerbation may reflect intrapulmonary spread of infection to previously unaffected airways rather than a change in microbial density or composition of the airway microbial communities. Future studies that exploit the cultivability of nearly all CF taxa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Sibley3">[31]</xref> and the increasingly low cost of obtaining whole-genome sequences of cultured taxa may determine the specific molecular mechanisms by which a child' s high-diversity microbiome is replaced in adulthood with a low-diversity highly resistant microbiome. Finally, we conclude that long-term changes in microbial community structure (richness) are likely to be associated with the slow decline in CF lung function over time.</p>

All but two consensus sequences (Consensus172 and Consensus202) matched to a known microbial sequence within the RDP database with an alignment length of at least 183 base pairs and a percent identity of at least 95.8%. Comparison of the consensus sequences with the same version of BLAST to version 104 of the SILVA reference tree (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arb-silva.de/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.arb-silva.de/</ext-link>) yielded similar results; all but the same two consensus sequences matched to a known microbial sequence in the SILVA database with an alignment length of at least 113 base pairs and a percent identity of 95.4%. Using NCBI BLAST (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi" xlink:type="simple">http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi</ext-link>) against the NR database on the two consensus sequences that did not match either RDP or SILVA revealed that one of the consensus sequences was a human contaminant and the other had no matching sequences in the NR database. These two OTUs were therefore removed from downstream analysis resulting in a total of 175 consensus OTUs generated from the 85 samples examined in this study (63 sputum, 22 mouthwash). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows the results of using the program align.seqs in the package Mothur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045001-Schloss1">[57]</xref> to map the sputum-derived non-chimeric microbial consensus sequences to version 104 of the SILVA database. To reduce the memory requirements of the align.seqs method, only the SILVA sequences that were detected by the BLASTN search of the consensus sequences were included in the “template” file for the align.seqs search.</p>
        <p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0045001.s001">Table S1</xref> shows the number of sequences for each sputum sample that passed all QC steps and were included in a non-chimeric OTU for which the consensus sequence mapped to a known microbial sequence. Because all of the consensus sequences for each of the OTUs in our analysis pool had an excellent (&gt;95%) match by BLAST to the SILVA reference tree and all but two of the consensus sequences had a &gt;95% match across the global alignment produced by align.seqs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g001">Figure 1</xref>), the SILVA reference tree was used as a basis for creation of the phylogenetic visualization in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g002">Figure 2</xref>. Within the SILVA reference tree, each consensus sequence was substituted for the node on the tree that had the closest match (as determined by the align.seqs program in Mothur). All other nodes were removed from the tree using custom Java code and the function deleteSubtree from the function org.forester.phylogeny Phylogeny within the Archaeopteryx (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phylosoft.org/archaeopteryx/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.phylosoft.org/archaeopteryx/</ext-link>) source code. Each reference sequence in the SILVA database was classified with v. 2.1 of the standalone version of the RDP classifier and the most refined classification at a confidence score of 80% was used to label each leaf in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g002">Figure 2</xref>. This was accomplished with custom Java code to produce a PhyloXML file, which was visualized with Archaeopteryx.</p>

        <title>Sample normalization</title>
        <p>In our dataset, the number of sequences per sample ranged from 2,292 to 7,212 with an average of 4,300.1 sequences per sample. To correct for variation in total sequence counts between samples, the abundance of each OTU in a given sample was standardized by calculating the logged sequence abundance using the following formula:<disp-formula id="pone.0045001.e001"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0045001.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
        <p>The logarithm was used to lessen the influence of more dominant OTUs. In order to take the log of zero, a pseudo-count (one sequence) is added to each sample for each taxon. In order to minimize the effect of this pseudo-count, all samples are normalized to the average number of sequences per sample before the addition of the pseudo-count.</p>

        <title>Statistical tests and sample size</title>
        <p>We obtained sequences for paired exacerbation and end of treatment timepoints for 21 patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0045001.s001">Table S1</xref>). For two additional patients, we were unable to obtained sequences for the exacerbation sample (patient 22) or the end of treatment sample (patient 12), because sample derived total DNA was limited. For 3 patients (patient 1, patient 11 and patient 19), we generated sequences for second set of paired exacerbation and end of treatment timepoints. Finally, for 13 patients (patients 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19, 21 and 23), we collected sequences for a stable timepoint taken either before or after the exacerbation event.</p>
        <p>For paired t-tests comparing exacerbation to end of treatment timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0045001-t003">Table 3</xref>), we interrogated 21 paired samples (the second set of paired exacerbation and end of treatment samples for patients 1, 11 and 19 were not included to avoid violating the assumption of independence). For paired t-tests comparing exacerbation and stable timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045001-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0045001-t003">Table 3</xref>), we considered the earliest exacerbation timepoint and the stable timepoint to yield a samples size of 13.</p>
        <p>Statistical tests were performed using the program JMP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jmp.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.jmp.com/</ext-link>). PCoAs were performed in the package Mothur (using the program pcoa) based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity defined as:<disp-formula id="pone.0045001.e002"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0045001.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>Where y<sub>ik</sub> and y<sub>jk</sub> are the log-transformed and normalized values for taxa k in samples i and j respectively and n is the number of taxa in all samples. Only taxa that had at least 10 total sequences across all samples were considered in the Bray-Curtis distance measurement.</p>
