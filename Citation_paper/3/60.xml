<abstract>
<p>The heart is the first organ required to function during embryonic development and is absolutely necessary for embryo survival. Cardiac activity is dependent on both the sinoatrial node (SAN), which is the pacemaker of heart's electrical activity, and the cardiac conduction system which transduces the electrical signal though the heart tissue, leading to heart muscle contractions. Defects in the development of cardiac electrical function may lead to severe heart disorders. The <italic>Erbb2</italic> (<italic>Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2</italic>) gene encodes a member of the EGF receptor family of receptor tyrosine kinases. The Erbb2 receptor lacks ligand-binding activity but forms heterodimers with other EGF receptors, stabilising their ligand binding and enhancing kinase-mediated activation of downstream signalling pathways. Erbb2 is absolutely necessary in normal embryonic development and homozygous mouse knock-out <italic>Erbb2</italic> embryos die at embryonic day (E)10.5 due to severe cardiac defects. We have isolated a mouse line, <italic>l11Jus8</italic>, from a random chemical mutagenesis screen, which carries a hypomorphic missense mutation in the <italic>Erbb2</italic> gene. Homozygous mutant embryos exhibit embryonic lethality by E12.5-13. The <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutants display cardiac haemorrhage and a failure of atrial function due to defects in atrial electrical signal propagation, leading to an atrial-specific conduction block, which does not affect ventricular conduction. The <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutant phenotype is distinct from those reported for <italic>Erbb2</italic> knockout mouse mutants. Thus, the <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mouse reveals a novel function of <italic>Erbb2</italic> during atrial conduction system development, which when disrupted causes death at mid-gestation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The heart is needed to pump blood through the blood vessels by repeated, rhythmic contractions, carrying oxygen and nutrients to various parts of the body. In addition to contracting muscle cells, the adult heart requires the correct function of two systems: the sinoatrial node (SAN), which is the impulse-generating (pacemaker) tissue located in the right atrium of the heart, and the cardiac conduction system which consists of the atrioventricular node (AVN), atrioventricular bundle (AVB), bundle branches (BB) and Purkinje fibers (subendocardial branches). The cardiac conduction system transduces the electrical signals from SAN to heart muscle cells. This system consists of specialised cardiomyocytes that are able to conduct cardiac action potentials more quickly and efficiently than any other cells in the heart, allowing synchronised contractions of the atria and ventricles, and is therefore essential for maintaining a consistent heart rhythm. Developmental defects in the formation of the conduction system may lead to heart diseases such as heart block, long Q-T syndrome, atrial and ventricular fibrillation and tachycardia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Dobrzynski1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Wolf1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>The heart is the first functional organ to be formed during embryonic development (22 days after conception in humans, 8–8.5 days in mice) and is absolutely necessary for embryo survival and correct development. Cardiac contractions start immediately after the linear heart tube forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Harvey1">[3]</xref>; the sinus venosus myocardium located next to the primitive atrium acts as a primary pacemaker which later develops into the SAN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Christoffels1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Christoffels2">[5]</xref>. In contrast to the pacemaker, the cardiac conduction system develops progressively. The atrioventricular canal (AVC) at E9.5 gives rise to AVN. The AVB is formed from the crest of the developing ventricular septum; Purkinje fibers develop in the trabecular myocardium from E11.5 until birth, with further postnatal maturation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Christoffels1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Christoffels2">[5]</xref>. Until the mature conduction system is formed, cardiac action potentials are transduced through the myocardium directly from one cardiomyocyte to another via intercellular gap junctions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Lampe1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Lampe2">[7]</xref>. In vertebrates, gap junctions are composed primarily of homo- or hetero-hexamers of connexins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Lodish1">[8]</xref>. The phosphorylation of connexins plays an important role in regulating the different properties of gap junctions, such as the trafficking, assembly/disassembly, degradation and gating of gap junction channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Lampe1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Lampe2">[7]</xref>. During mouse embryonic development, five major connexins are expressed in the heart, including Cx45 (the first connexin expressed in developing mouse heart) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Alcolea1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Kumai1">[10]</xref>, Cx43 (the main connexin in chamber myocardium) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Severs1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Vaidya1">[12]</xref> and Cx40 (found in atrial and ventricular chamber myocardium) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Miquerol1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-vanKempen1">[14]</xref>. Connexin abnormalities contribute to congenital heart defects, illustrating the importance of electrical signal propagation during cardiac development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Salameh1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>The <italic>Erbb2</italic> (<italic>Mus musculus v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2</italic>) gene encodes a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of tyrosine kinases. Due to its extracellular protein structure, the Erbb2 receptor itself does not bind ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Holbro1">[16]</xref>. Instead, it binds other members of EGF receptor family (Egfr, Erbb3 and Erbb4) to form heterodimers, stabilising their binding to ligands and enhancing kinase-mediated activation of downstream signalling pathways (such as MAP and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Carraway1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Tzahar1">[19]</xref>. Erbb2 is able to form heterodimers with any of the other three EGF receptors and is believed to be the preferred dimerisation partner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Olayioye1">[20]</xref>. In humans, <italic>ERBB2/HER2</italic> is commonly amplified in breast cancer, leading to receptor over expression and driving the activation of downstream pathways that stimulate malignant cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-MohdSharial1">[21]</xref>. <italic>ERBB2/HER2</italic> amplification is a marker of aggressive disease, although the development of the trastuzumab monoclonal antibody targeting the ERBB2/HER2 receptor has revolutionised breast cancer treatment regimes, leading to improved survival rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-MohdSharial1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition to its pathological role in breast cancer, <italic>Erbb2</italic> is essential for normal embryonic development. Homozygous knock-out mice lacking <italic>Erbb2</italic> are lethal at mid-gestation (embryonic day 10.5) and die due to severe cardiac defects, including an enlarged heart with thin ventricular myocardium, absent trabeculae and decreased atrioventricular cushions, leading to poor circulation and irregular heartbeat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Lee1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Negro1">[23]</xref>. Conditional <italic>Erbb2</italic> mutation in ventricular cardiomyocytes leads to a severe dilated cardiomyopathy associated with the occurrence of sudden death, partially due to an impaired cardiac conduction system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Ozcelik1">[24]</xref>. Absence of <italic>Erbb2</italic> also results in neural defects such as degeneration of motor neurons and absence of Schwann cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0107041-t001">Table 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Lee1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Erickson1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Garratt1">[26]</xref>. It has been shown that <italic>Erbb2</italic> participates in ventricular conduction system development and maturation via its involvement in cardiac trabeculation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Negro1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Liu1">[27]</xref>. However, the role of <italic>Erbb2</italic> in the atrial conduction system development and atrial action potential propagation is unclear.</p>

<p>From an <italic>N</italic>-ethyl-<italic>N</italic>-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Kile1">[28]</xref> we have isolated a mouse line, <italic>l11Jus8</italic>, carrying a hypomorphic missense mutant allele of <italic>Erbb2</italic>. These mice are homozygous lethal by embryonic day (E)12.5-13 and display morphological defects in the developing atria; similar defects have not been reported in <italic>Erbb2</italic> targeted deletion mouse mutants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0107041-t001">Table 1</xref>). We show that <italic>l11Jus8</italic> homozygous mutants exhibit compromised atrial function due to defects in atrial electrical signal propagation, leading to an atrial-specific conduction block that does not affect ventricular conduction. As relatively few studies have identified specific defects in atrial development, research on the <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mouse model extends our knowledge of the molecular requirements for atrial function. The <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mouse line reveals a novel role for <italic>Erbb2</italic> during atrial conduction system development, demonstrating the importance of atrial function for embryonic survival.</p>

<title>Mice</title>
<p>The <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mouse strain was generated by random ENU mutagenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Hentges1">[29]</xref>. Mice were maintained in the Biological Service Facility of the University of Manchester, UK, with local ethical approval and according to UK Home Office requirements (Home Office project 40/2912). Mice used for electrical readings were maintained in the Animal Facility of the Institute of Anatomy, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic and experiments were carried out in accordance with Czech law governing animal care and experimentation. Mice were out-crossed a minimum of 6 times to 129S5/SvEvBrd animals, although the use of the Chr11 balancer ensured that the candidate region on chromosome 11 remained heterozygous for C57BL/6 and 129S5/SvEvBrd DNA in viable animals. The <italic>K14-agouti</italic> transgene integrated on the balancer chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Hentges1">[29]</xref> allowed the identification of animals without molecular genotyping. Embryo genotyping to distinguish between the 129S5/SvEvBrd and C57BL/6 chromosomes was performed by PCR analysis of genomic DNA using STS markers D11Mit4, D11Mit35, D11Mit327 and D11Mit99. STS marker sequences were obtained from the Ensembl database.</p>

<title>Next-Generation Sequencing</title>
<p>The Next-Generation Sequencing was performed in the Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine (Manchester Academic Health Science Centre). Genomic DNA was isolated from a single E12.5 homozygous <italic>l11Jus8</italic> embryo (C57BL/6J background) using ISOLATE II Genomic DNA Kit (Bioline). 1 µg of DNA was used to create the genomic library using the TruSeq DNA Sample Prep Kit. Whole genome sequencing was performed on one lane of a HiSeq 2500 sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), following the manufacturer's protocols. Reads were mapped to the GRCm38/mm10 mouse genome using BWA mapping software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Li1">[30]</xref> and analysed using online Galaxy sequencing analysis tool (main.g2.bx.psu.edu; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Blankenberg1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Goecks1">[33]</xref>). Positions between 69–104 Mb on mouse chromosome 11 were selected and MAQ model with default parameters was applied to identify positions with nucleotides different from the reference. Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-McLaren1">[34]</xref> was used to annotate SNPs and eliminate known SNPs. Novel non-coding SNPs were inspected manually to identify those in RNA genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107041.s009">Table S1</xref>). Sequence variants were confirmed in exome sequence data from a single heterozygous <italic>l11Jus8</italic> embryo. Exome sequencing was performed at the University of Liverpool Centre for Genomic Research. Sanger sequencing was performed on an additional 3 homozygous mutant <italic>l11Jus8</italic> embryos using BigDye v3.1 reagents (Applied Biosystems) in the University of Manchester Sequencing Facility according to manufacturer's instructions to verify base changes in coding regions and non-coding RNA genes. Only those variants confirmed by Sanger sequencing in an additional 3 mutant embryos were considered as candidate mutations.

Substantial van der Waals overlaps were found with all rotamers, indicating that the mutant protein cannot fold to the same native structure without additional structural accommodation.

E12.5 embryos with visible thoracic haemorrhage and/or yolk sac vascular defects (6/21) were excluded from analysis. Optical mapping was performed at 37°C in oxygenated Tyrodes with added blebbistatin (1∶1000 of 14 mM stock in DMSO) to stop muscle contractions and heart movements. Recordings were done with Ultima L high-speed camera (SciMedia Ltd., Japan) at 0.25, 0.5 and 1 kHz and the analysis of recordings resulting in the generation of spatio-temporal epicardial activation maps was performed using the BV_Analyzer software. The protocol and processing algorithms for generation of activation maps were described in detail previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Reckova1">[44]</xref>. At least three recordings were made for each sample. Activation maps were compared together with the rhythm strip of atrial and ventricular rate between genotypes essentially as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Sedmera1">[45]</xref>. Parameters analysed presence, direction and extent of atrial and ventricular activation and propagation.

<title><italic>l11Jus8</italic> mouse line: mutation isolation and analysis</title>
<p>The <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutant mouse line was created by random ENU mutagenesis and isolated from a balancer chromosome screen for mutants with embryonic lethality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Kile1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Hentges1">[29]</xref>. The <italic>l11Jus8</italic> line was selected for further study because it displayed embryonic lethality at E12.5 arising from suspected cardiac defects, including vascular and cardiac haemorrhage. Due to the use of a balancer chromosome in the mutagenesis screen, the candidate interval for the <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutation was known to be within a 35 Mb region of mouse chromosome 11 between the <italic>Trp53</italic> and <italic>Wnt3</italic> loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Hentges1">[29]</xref>. Since homozygous mutant <italic>l11Jus8</italic> embryos do not survive past day E13.5 of embryonic development, we hypothesised that an important protein function would be disrupted in these mutants. In order to find the causative mutation, we isolated genomic DNA from homozygous <italic>l11Jus8</italic> embryos, performed genomic Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), and used bioinformatic analysis to identify single nucleotide variations within the 35 Mb candidate interval. Using the GRCm38 mouse genome assembly, three coding changes on mouse chromosome 11 were found: T72,213,810C in the <italic>Med31</italic> gene resulting in Tyr-57-Cys missense change, T79,447,501A located within the <italic>Nf1</italic> gene resulting in a Met-1113-Lys missense mutation and T98,433,986G within the <italic>Erbb2</italic> gene causing a Met-802-Arg missense change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107041.s009">Table S1</xref>). These changes were confirmed by Sanger sequencing on three additional homozygous <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutant embryos. Additionally, annotated novel and non-coding RNAs (microRNAs, lncRNAs, anti-sense RNAs) were also checked for sequence variations specific to the <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutant. Predicted base changes within RNA genes were not confirmed by further Sanger sequencing on additional mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107041.s009">Table S1</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine which sequence variant best represented the <italic>l11Jus8</italic> causative mutation, we bred animals carrying recombinant chromosomes to <italic>l11Jus8</italic> heterozygotes, and analysed the viability at weaning of offspring carrying homozygous C57BL/6 DNA (inherited from the mutagenised parent) in smaller intervals within the candidate region. Based on the analysis of genomic DNA from recombinant animals, only the <italic>Erbb2</italic> mutation is a valid genetic candidate for causing the <italic>l11Jus8</italic> phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), because lethality was only seen in recombinants homozygous for the <italic>Erbb2</italic> mutation. We have confirmed that no animals homozygous for the <italic>Erbb2</italic> mutation survived to weaning age, showing a significant deviation from expected Mendelian frequency (Chi-squared test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107041.s010">Table S2</xref>). Sanger sequencing demonstrated that the <italic>Erbb2</italic> mutation was present in homozygous <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Dissections at E12.5 confirmed that embryos homozygous for the mutation in the <italic>Erbb2</italic> gene exhibit the <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) while heterozygous animals were viable, fertile, and showed no defects during development. Animals double homozygous for both the <italic>Med31</italic> and <italic>Nf1</italic> missense mutations were viable at weaning age (3 pups in 1 litter). Additionally, a non-coding mutation in <italic>Zzef1</italic> previously identified in this mouse line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Boles1">[46]</xref> was excluded as a candidate based on recombination mapping.</p>
<p>The mutation in the <italic>Erbb2</italic> gene is located in the conserved Serine-Threonine/Tyrosine protein kinase catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Utilising the reported crystal structure of the human ERBB2 protein (PDB id 3RCD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Ishikawa1">[37]</xref>), we predict from an analysis of side-chain rotamer conformations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Lovell1">[40]</xref> that the M802R amino acid change will create van der Waals clashes, impeding folding and likely causing a loss of kinase catalytic function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). It is not known how the M802R affects Erbb2 protein function. We did not detect any differences in the phosphorylation of Erk, one Erbb2 target, in <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107041.s003">Figure S3</xref>), so at present cannot determine the biochemical nature of the M802R mutation.</p>
<p>To confirm that <italic>Erbb2</italic> is expressed in cardiac tissues and to determine if the missense mutation affects gene expression, we performed RT-PCR with cDNA prepared from RNA isolated from E12.5 atria and ventricles of <italic>l11Jus8</italic> heterozygote and homozygote hearts. Since the heart lumen is filled with erythrocytes that are difficult to separate completely from the surrounding cardiac tissue, as a control we also prepared cDNA from embryonic erythrocytes collected during dissections. Clear bands indicating the expression of <italic>Erbb2</italic> were found in atrial and ventricular samples of both genotypes but not in the erythrocyte sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g001">Figure 1F</xref> top panel). The expression of the <italic>Prpf8</italic> gene (encoding a core component of the spliceosome) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Grainger1">[47]</xref> was used as a positive control to confirm the presence of cDNA in erythrocyte sample. We also identified <italic>Erbb2</italic> expression in the developing E12.5 wild type yolk sac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g001">Figure 1F</xref> bottom panel). To determine if Erbb2 protein distribution was altered in <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutants, we examined the localisation of Erbb2 in E12.5 heterozygote and homozygous mutant hearts. No alterations in the expression pattern in the ventricles or atria were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). Notably, Erbb2 was expressed throughout the cardiac tissue, but not within blood cells, supporting our RT-PCR data. The presence of Erbb2 protein in <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutants supports our hypothesis that the M802R mutation does not create a null allele.</p>

<title>Morphological characterisation of the <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutant phenotype</title>
<p>Heterozygous <italic>l11Jus8</italic> embryos were viable and had no overt developmental defects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107041.s004">Figure S4A</xref>, D, B, E). Homozygous mutants were lethal with embryonic death observed between days E12.5-13 of development; mutants exhibited severe haemorrhages in the thoracic cavity and head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Mutant yolk sacks (YS) display reduced YS vessel volume becoming progressively more severe from E11.5 – E12.5, resulting in visible absence of blood in YS vessels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107041.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Notably, yolk sack defects were only visible in the embryos with haemorrhages in the thoracic cavity. Approximately 29% of mutant embryos possessed yolk sac defects at E12.5, indicating that this aspect of the phenotype is not fully penetrant, while lethality by E13.5 was fully penetrant. Histological examination of <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutant embryos at E11.5 revealed subtle defects in atrial wall structure; no other cardiac abnormalities were detected at this stage, and hearts were beating visibly during dissections (data not shown). Because mice homozygous for a targeted deletion of <italic>Erbb2</italic> display a reduction in endocardial cushion size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Lee1">[22]</xref>, we analysed atrioventricular cushion development in <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutant embryos at E12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g002">Figure 2A–B</xref>) but found no differences as compared to control littermates. Similarly, no defects were observed in outflow tract (OFT) vessel septation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g002">Figure 2C–D</xref>), despite the reported role for <italic>Erbb2</italic> in this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Camenisch1">[48]</xref>. <italic>Erbb2</italic> knockout embryos also display a lack of ventricular trabeculation leading to death by E11.0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Lee1">[22]</xref>, however <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutant embryos survive past this time point, and have clear evidence of trabeculation at E12.5 that is indistinguishable from control littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g002">Figure 2E–F</xref>).</p>

<p>Although ventricular myocardium, outflow tract and atrioventricular cushion morphology was normal, 5/15 homozygous <italic>l11Jus8</italic> E11.5 embryos exhibited collapsing of atria such that the chamber lumen appeared decreased in size and the atrial myocardium appeared thickened and irregularly folded (data not shown). Highly eosinophilic stained patches containing fragmented irregularly shaped cell nuclei were present, and the epi- and endocardium were detached from the myocardium; by E12.5 these changes were more pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g002">Figure 2G–H</xref> arrows). In mutant hearts with distended atria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), the atrial wall was noticeably thinner in comparison to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g002">Figure 2I–J</xref>) while ventricles remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g002">Figure 2K–L</xref>). The developing pectinate muscles, found specifically in the atria, were present in both heterozygous and homozygous mutant atria (magnified areas in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g002">Figure 2I–J</xref>). Aside from cardiac abnormalities, no defects in the development of internal organs or embryonic vasculature were found in <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107041.s004">Figure S4C</xref>, F). Notably, the atrial phenotype observed in homozygous <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutants cannot be examined in <italic>Erbb2</italic> null embryos (phenotype summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0107041-t001">Table 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Lee1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Erickson1">[25]</xref> due to the early gestation lethality of <italic>Erbb2</italic> null mutants.</p>

<title>Molecular characterisation of the <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutants</title>
<p>To further characterise the <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutant phenotype, we analysed the expression of <italic>Myl4</italic>, a marker of cardiomyocyte differentiation, in wild type, <italic>l11Jus8</italic> heterozygous and homozygous E10.5 embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107041.s006">Figure S6A–C</xref>). We also performed immunohistochemistry on atrial cross-sections from wild type, <italic>l11Jus8</italic> heterozygous and homozygous E12.5 hearts for Smooth Muscle α-Actin (smooth muscle cell marker), Laminin α 1 (basement membrane component), Fibronectin (cardiac ECM component) and E11.5 hearts for phospho-histone H3 (marker of cell proliferation). Surprisingly, expression of all markers was similar between all three genotypes suggesting the presence of correct cell types and cellular functions in <italic>l11Jus8</italic> homozygous mutant hearts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107041.s006">Figure S6D–O</xref>).</p>
<p>DAPI staining of cell nuclei in E12.5 atrial sections (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107041.s006">Figure S6P–R</xref>), revealed signs of fragmented DNA in the eosinophilic patches in <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutants (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g002">Figure 2H</xref>), which may indicate extensive cell death in these areas. We tested this hypothesis and found that activated Caspase3 expression was identical between wild type and <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g002">Figure 2M–N</xref>), suggesting that there was no increased apoptosis in <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutants. However, staining with propidium iodide revealed necrotic cells in E12.5 <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutant atria (3/6 mutant hearts) but no necrosis in heterozygous atria (0/10 heterozygous hearts; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g002">Figure 2O–P</xref>).</p>

<title>Cardiac function in <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutant embryos</title>
<p>Since the <italic>l11Jus8</italic> hearts do not show significant defects at the morphological or molecular level but the embryos display mid-gestation lethality consistent with cardiac defects, we next investigated heart function in the mutant embryos. The heart rate of E10.5, 11.5 and 12.5 embryos was assessed visually during dissections and on ultrasound movies of embryos <italic>in utero.</italic> No differences were observed between wild type, heterozygous and viable homozygous <italic>l11Jus8</italic> embryos (data not shown). However, only 8/10 E11.5 and 4/12 E12.5 homozygous <italic>l11Jus8</italic> embryos were viable with a heartbeat present at the time of dissection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107041.s011">Table S3</xref>). Moreover, during dissections <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutant hearts with normal macroscopic atrial morphology always contracted normally but hearts with distended atria (confirmed via genotyping as homozygous <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutants) only had ventricles contracting; atria in these hearts either did not contract at all or in rare cases, twitched slightly but lacked proper blood movement through the heart.</p>

<title>Optical mapping of action potential propagation</title>
<p>To investigate cardiac function of the <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutants in detail, we performed optical mapping of the electrical activity in wild type and mutant hearts using a voltage-sensitive dye di-4-ANEPPS to visualise the propagation of the electrical signal through the tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Sankova1">[43]</xref>. In E11.5 hearts of all three genotypes the electrical signal was detected in both atria and ventricles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0107041-t002">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g003">Figure 3A–B</xref>; signal in heterozygous hearts not shown). Occasionally, partial atrioventricular block (AV block, defined as signal present in atria but not observed in ventricles) was detected (AVb in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0107041-t002">Table 2</xref>). AV block is often found in optical mapping experiments and results from experimental manipulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Sankova1">[43]</xref>. Notably, the <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutant hearts did not display distended atria at E11.5 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0107041-t002">Table 2</xref>). In E12.5 samples, 9/21 (43%) homozygous <italic>l11Jus8</italic> hearts had distended atria and did not contract; mapping these hearts did not result in clear reading of the electrical signal and they were excluded from further analysis (labelled “distended” in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0107041-t002">Table 2</xref>). Only <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutant E12.5 hearts without atrial distension were used in subsequent analysis of electrical activity. At this stage wild type hearts displayed consistent electrical activity in both the atria and ventricles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), or the presence of AV block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g003">Figure 3D</xref> white arrowhead). Overall, AV block was found in 58%, 46% and 50% of wild type, heterozygous and homozygous E12.5 <italic>l11Jus8</italic> hearts, respectively (AVb in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0107041-t002">Table 2</xref>). Surprisingly, we also found partial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g003">Figure 3E</xref> white arrowhead) or full atrial block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g003">Figure 3F</xref> white arrowheads): while the electrical signal was present in ventricular myocardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g003">Figure 3E–F</xref> black arrowheads), the corresponding atrial signal was not detected. Atrial block was observed in 2/50 (4%) heterozygous and 6/12 (50%) homozygous <italic>l11Jus8</italic> hearts (Ab in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0107041-t002">Table 2</xref>) but not in any of the 29 wild type hearts analysed. An atrial block phenotype has not been described before in wild type mouse or chick hearts, or <italic>Cx40</italic> mutant mouse hearts (55 chick hearts ages 3–10 days; 19 wild type mouse hearts, 12 <italic>Cx40</italic>+/− and 18 <italic>Cx40</italic>−/− hearts; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Sedmera1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Benes1">[49]</xref>). Notably, the percentage of absent atrial peaks (as compared to the presence of ventricular peaks) was 13% and 36% in two heterozygous embryos. However, in <italic>l11Jus8</italic> homozygous hearts a range of 3.3–100% of atrial peaks were missing (one sample had full atrial block with no atrial signals detected while regular ventricular signal was observed). Statistical analysis shows that the proportion of embryos with atrial block is significantly different between all genotypes in pair-wise comparisons (heterozygous and homozygous <italic>l11Jus8</italic> samples Chi square, p&lt;0.0001). The observation that atrial block was present in homozygous <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutant hearts lacking yolk sac vessel defects, cardiac distension, or haemorrhage suggests that atrial electrical alterations precede or occur independently of morphological abnormalities of the atria, yolk sack or necrosis in the mutant hearts. Thus impaired atrial electrical function is the most likely reason for embryonic lethality in <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutants.</p>

<p>We next investigated the spatiotemporal propagation of the electrical signal through the atrial and ventricular tissue using maps reconstructed from the optical recordings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Sankova1">[43]</xref>. Electrical signals travel through the developing heart in a characteristic pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g004">Figure 4A</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Sedmera1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Sedmera2">[50]</xref>, and alterations in the signal propagation pattern could indicate cardiac dysfunction. Signal propagation maps were reconstructed using the derivatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g004">Figure 4B–C</xref>) calculated from the graphs of the electrical activity shown previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g003">Figure 3A–B</xref>). At E11.5 in hearts of all genotypes without atrial block, the electrical signal originated in the roof of the right atrium, spread within 3–5 ms through the right atrium, and travelled with a slight delay (approximately 2 ms) across the left atrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g004">Figure 4D–F</xref>). After 50–130 ms delay due to passing through the slow-conducting AV canal tissue (AVC), the signal appeared in the interventriclular groove (IVG) from where it moved laterally along ventricles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g004">Figure 4G–I</xref>). In E11.5 wild type, heterozygous and 3/6 homozygous <italic>l11Jus8</italic> hearts complete atrial activation maps without gaps were reconstructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g004">Figure 4D–E</xref>). However, in 3/6 homozygous <italic>l11Jus8</italic> E11.5 hearts, gaps indicating regions of tissue lacking electrical conduction (further defined in Materials and Methods and Figures S1 and S2) were found (asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g004">Figure 4F</xref>), implying aberrant signal propagation in mutants. Ventricular signal propagation was complete without gaps in all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g004">Figure 4G–I</xref>).</p>

<p>Derivatives of the electrical signal were also used to reconstruct signal propagation maps at E12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g005">Figure 5A–C</xref>, corresponding to electrical signal shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g003">Figure 3C, E, F</xref>). In E12.5 hearts, no atrial gaps could be detected in wild type samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). However, regions of atrial tissue lacking electrical signal were observed in 7/50 (14%) heterozygous (data not shown) and 10/12 (83%) homozygous hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g005">Figure 5E–F</xref>). The proportion of samples demonstrating atrial conduction gaps is statistically significant when compared between wild type and homozygous <italic>l11Jus8</italic> samples, as well as between heterozygous and homozygous <italic>l11Jus8</italic> samples (p&lt;0.0001). All 6 homozygous <italic>l11Jus8</italic> hearts with partial atrial block exhibited gaps in the maps reconstructed from the detected atrial signals, with the majority of atrial tissue completely lacking electrical activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107041-g005">Figure 5F</xref>).

<p>During embryonic development, prior to the formation of the mature cardiac conduction system, cardiac action potentials are transduced between cardiomyocytes via intercellular gap junctions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Lampe1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Lampe2">[7]</xref>. Connexin protein localisation serves as an indicator of cellular gap junctions, and alterations in connexin protein distribution could result in aberrant gap junctions leading to errors in electrical signal propagation in the embryonic heart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Salameh1">[15]</xref>. Due to the electrical signal propagation defects detected in homozygous <italic>l11Jus8</italic> hearts, we therefore examined the distribution of Connexin 40 and Connexin 43 in wild type and <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutant hearts. However, in both the atria and ventricles of wild type and <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutant hearts no differences in the distribution of either protein could be identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107041.s008">Figure S8</xref>). It has been reported that heterozygosity for either Cx40 or Cx43 reduces atrial conduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Kirchhoff1">[51]</xref>. Because we detect both Cx40 and Cx43 in mutant hearts, we hypothesise that a loss of Cx40 or Cx43 is not the underlying mechanism for the atrial conduction defects of the <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutant.</p>
<p>Overall, the optical mapping data above demonstrate that atria of <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutant hearts begin to lose the ability to conduct electrical signal at E11.5, leading to a block in atrial conduction by E12.5-13. The loss of gap junctions due to abnormalities in connexin protein distribution is unlikely to underlie these conduction defects. We propose that the embryonic lethality detected in <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutants arises due to atrial conduction failure and subsequent atrial necrosis, as no other significant cardiovascular abnormalities have been found in mutant embryos.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We present data to demonstrate that a missense mutation in <italic>Erbb2</italic> results in a specific defect in atrial electrical conduction during embryonic development. The M802R mutation affects a residue within the protein kinase domain of Erbb2 that is conserved across multiple species, including human. Our analysis of human sequence variations from the 1000 genomes project <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Abecasis1">[52]</xref> reveals that although this particular mutation is not found in the dataset, variants at positions nearby are likely to be deleterious. The 1000 genomes dataset contains 68 missense variants within the kinase catalytic domain of the ERBB2 protein (ENSP00000269571), of these 45 are predicted by SIFT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Kumar1">[53]</xref> to be deleterious, and 46 are predicted by PolyPhen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Adzhubei1">[54]</xref> to be probably damaging. Additionally, our structural modelling of the M802R mutation indicates that protein stability may be altered due to side chain conformation clashes.</p>
<p>Although the extracellular domain structure of Erbb2 precludes ligand binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Holbro1">[16]</xref>, the Erbb2 protein functions through heterodimerisation with other members of the EGFR family to achieve ligand-dependent activation of tyrosine kinase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Holbro1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Pentassuglia1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Fuller1">[56]</xref>. There are a series of five autophosphorylation sites within the Erbb2 cytoplasmic tail, one of which has been demonstrated to negatively regulate Erbb2 signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Dankort1">[57]</xref>. Knock-in mice have been generated carrying mutations within these autophosphorylation sites. Notably, homozygous knock-in animals for Y1028F, Y1144F, and Y1227F Erbb2 missense mutations were viable, with an apparently normal phenotype. Animals carrying a hypomorphic Erbb2 allele expressing 10% of wild-type protein levels <italic>in trans</italic> to a null allele demonstrated perinatal lethality due to impaired diaphragm innervation causing respiratory failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Chan1">[58]</xref>. The Y1028F allele when placed in trans to a null allele was found to rescue the perinatal lethality by reducing Erbb2 protein turnover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Chan1">[58]</xref>. Cardiac embryonic development can be assumed to be sufficient in the <italic>Erbb2</italic> hypomorphic mutants due to their survival into the perinatal period. Therefore, the atrial electrical alterations and death detected in the <italic>l11Jus8</italic> homozygous mutant embryos may indicate that the M802R mutation within the kinase domain of Erbb2 severely compromises Erbb2 function in a manner distinct from the autophosphorylation site missense mutations. In comparison to the less severe phenotypes generated from autophosphorylation site mutants, our data indicate that kinase activity is of greater importance than autophosphorylation for Erbb2 function. Many of the <italic>Erbb2</italic> null mutants were analysed on a mixed 129 and C57BL/6 background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Lee1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Erickson1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Garratt1">[26]</xref>. The <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mice were also maintained on a mixed 129 and C57BL/6 background, although there are likely to be differences to the prior knockouts in the percentages and areas of the genome that are comprised from each strain. Thus, we cannot formally exclude genetic background differences as a confounding factor in comparing the M802R allele to other <italic>Erbb2</italic> mutant alleles.</p>
<p>Because the Erbb2 receptor lacks ligand-binding activity, its signalling function must be mediated through interactions with other family member proteins. Therefore, the phenotype we detect in the <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutant mouse might arise due to impaired signal transduction specific to one interacting partner. An examination of the null phenotypes of <italic>Egfr/Erbb1</italic>, <italic>Erbb3</italic> and <italic>Erbb4</italic> mutant mice indicates that the cardiac defects present are dissimilar to the <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Fuller1">[56]</xref>. For example, <italic>Erbb4</italic> null mutants display cardiac trabeculation defects and lethality at E10.5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Gassmann1">[59]</xref> that is similar to the <italic>Erbb2</italic> null phenotype. <italic>Erbb3</italic> null mutants display a failure to form endocardial cushions, linked to lethality at E13.5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Erickson1">[25]</xref>. <italic>Egfr/Erbb1</italic> null mutants display early embryonic lethality, but this is not primarily linked to cardiac dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Threadgill1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Sibilia1">[61]</xref>. Thus, the null phenotypes of other EGFR family proteins are not identical to the <italic>l11Jus8</italic> phenotype, although genetic background may also contribute to phenotype differences. A more detailed investigation of the function and downstream signalling activities of the other EGFR family members in <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutants may determine if moderation of the function of a specific family member or downstream signalling effector contributes to the <italic>l11Jus8</italic> phenotype.</p>
<p>It is unclear why the electrical conduction defect seen in the <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutants is restricted to the atria, as we have shown that <italic>Erbb2</italic> is expressed in both the atria and ventricles of the developing heart. Prior studies on a zebrafish <italic>Erbb2</italic> mutant demonstrated an aberrant pattern of electrical activity which indicated the ventricular conduction system failed to develop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Liu1">[27]</xref>. Additionally, the EGFR ligand Neuregulin 1 (Nrg1) has been shown to promote cardiomyocyte differentiation into cardiac conduction system cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Rentschler1">[62]</xref>. Hearts cultured with exogenous Nrg1 demonstrate an altered pattern of ventricular conduction activity, however atrial electrical mapping was not presented in the study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Rentschler1">[62]</xref>. Nrg1 treatment of adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes in primary culture increases focal adhesion formation, resulting in synchronous beating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Kuramochi1">[63]</xref>, demonstrating another link between <italic>Erbb2</italic> and ventricular conduction. It is noted that <italic>Nrg1</italic> has higher expression in the ventricles and <italic>Nrg2</italic> expression levels are greater in the atria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Rentschler1">[62]</xref>. However, a critical role for <italic>Nrg2</italic> in atrial conduction system development can be ruled out from studies on the <italic>Nrg2</italic> null mouse, which is viable and presents no cardiac conduction system defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Britto1">[64]</xref>.</p>
<p>Embryonic cardiac defects, including atrial conduction failure, are not found in mice with cardiomyocyte-specific deletions of <italic>Erbb2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Ozcelik1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Crone1">[65]</xref>. At present our experiments cannot determine whether a non-cardiomyocyte tissue source requires Erbb2 function for cardiac conduction system development, or whether the M802R missense mutation interferes with a key factor for cardiac conduction system function in a manner that is not replicated in null models. In addition to the embryonic requirement for Erbb2 for cardiac function, it has been proposed that Erbb2 functions in a cardioprotective capacity in adult cardiomyocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Doggen1">[66]</xref>. Notably, the use of the anti-cancer drug trastuzumab, an ERBB2 specific-inhibitor, causes cardiotoxicity and congestive heart failure in some breast cancer patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Pentassuglia1">[55]</xref>. Similarly, the deletion of <italic>Erbb2</italic> in adult cardiomyocytes causes early cardiac dysfunction and severe dilated cardiomyopathy in the absence of readily demonstrable cardiomyocyte apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Ozcelik1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Crone1">[65]</xref>. In humans and mice dilated cardiomyopathy contributes to impairment of the conduction system, causing arrhythmias and sudden death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Ozcelik1">[24]</xref>. Deletion of <italic>Erbb2</italic> in both atria and ventricles results in an earlier onset of cardiac pathology than the deletion of <italic>Erbb2</italic> solely in ventricular cardiomyocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Crone1">[65]</xref>. A requirement for Erbb2 function in the atria may persist into the adult given the increased severity of cardiomyopathy arising from deletion of <italic>Erbb2</italic> in cardiomyocytes of all chambers.</p>
<p>The mechanism of the atrial block resulting from the <italic>Erbb2</italic> mutation remains unclear. We speculate that the possible mechanism involves abnormalities in action potential transduction through the atrial myocardium rather than the generation of the signal by the SAN, because normal ventricular signals are observed at a regular pace independently of the presence or absence of atrial signals. The shape and duration of the action potentials present in the <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutants do not appear to be altered in comparison to the signals in the control hearts. Given that Erbb2 is a transmembrane protein, it could be involved (directly or indirectly) in the restoration of the membrane potential after action potential transduction. Thus, ablation of Erbb2 activity in <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutants may lead to the slowdown and eventually complete block of the membrane potential restoration and abortion of signal transduction. The hearts used in electrical mapping did not have any apparent atrial distension or necrosis, and were beating at the time of analysis. However, it remains possible that a subtle alteration in atrial cell function occurs prior to the detection of necrosis in mutant embryos, and this alteration subsequently contributes to the cardiac conduction system defects.</p>
<p>The embryonic lethality observed in the <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutant also suggests that ERBB2 mutations may contribute to miscarriages, and the identification in the 1000 genomes dataset of multiple variations within the ERBB2 kinase domain predicted to be detrimental confirms that potentially damaging alleles are present in the human population. Additionally, our research on the <italic>l11Jus8</italic> mutant may inform future investigations into chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity associated with inhibition of ERBB2 signalling, as new anti-cancer therapeutics are being designed to target the ERBB2 kinase domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107041-Nielsen1">[67]</xref>.</p>
<p>The use of a random mutagenesis approach, which prompted the characterisation of a missense mutation within the kinase domain of Erbb2, led to the discovery of a requirement for <italic>Erbb2</italic> in atrial electrical conduction. This role for Erbb2 had not been identified from prior studies on null or phosphorylation site mutants, demonstrating the advantages of using a random mutagenesis approach to annotate gene function. Given the dearth of research investigations into atrial development, our work demonstrates the importance of atrial function for embryonic survival, and highlights the need for additional studies on embryonic atrial function to link Erbb2 kinase domain defects to cardiac conduction system development.</p>
