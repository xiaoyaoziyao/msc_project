<abstract>
<p>Neuronal dynamics are fundamentally constrained by the underlying structural network architecture, yet much of the details of this synaptic connectivity are still unknown even in neuronal cultures <italic>in vitro</italic>. Here we extend a previous approach based on information theory, the Generalized Transfer Entropy, to the reconstruction of connectivity of simulated neuronal networks of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We show that, due to the model-free nature of the developed measure, both kinds of connections can be reliably inferred if the average firing rate between synchronous burst events exceeds a small minimum frequency. Furthermore, we suggest, based on systematic simulations, that even lower spontaneous inter-burst rates could be raised to meet the requirements of our reconstruction algorithm by applying a weak spatially homogeneous stimulation to the entire network. By combining multiple recordings of the same <italic>in silico</italic> network before and after pharmacologically blocking inhibitory synaptic transmission, we show then how it becomes possible to infer with high confidence the excitatory or inhibitory nature of each individual neuron.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Important advances in the last decade have provided unprecedented detail on the structure and function of brain circuits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Bullmore1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Power1">[2]</xref> and even programs aiming at an exhaustive mapping of the brain connectome(s) have been announced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Chicurel1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Alivisatos2">[6]</xref>. First, the combination of invasive and non-invasive techniques such as high-resolution optical imagery and diffusion-based tractography have revealed the major architectural traits of brain circuitry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Hagmann1">[7]</xref>. Second, functional imaging has provided non-invasive measures of brain activity, both at rest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Deco1">[8]</xref> and during the realization of specific tasks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Power1">[2]</xref>. These efforts have opened new perspectives in neuroscience and psychiatry, for instance to identify general principles underlying interactions between multi-scale brain circuits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Varela1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Raizada1">[10]</xref>, to probe the implementation of complex cognitive processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Corbetta1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Gaillard1">[12]</xref>, and to design novel clinical prognosis tools by linking brain pathologies with specific alterations of connectivity and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Zhou1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Lynall1">[15]</xref>. At the same time, tremendous technological advancements in serial-section electron microscopy are making the systematic investigation of synaptic connectivity at the level of detail of cortical microcircuits accessible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Bock1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>Despite continuous progresses, the understanding of inter-relations between the observed functional couplings and the underlying neuronal dynamics and circuit structure is still a major open problem. Several works have shown that functional connectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Friston1">[17]</xref> at multiple scales is reminiscent of the underlying structural architecture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Deco1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Wang1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Honey1">[19]</xref>. This structure-to-function correspondence is, however, not direct and is rather mediated by interaction dynamics. On one side (“functional multiplicity”), structural networks generating a large reservoir of possible dynamical states can give rise to flexible switching between multiple functional connectivity networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Battaglia1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Deco2">[21]</xref>. On the other (“structural degeneracy”), very different structural networks giving rise to analogous dynamical regimes may generate qualitatively similar functional networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Stetter1">[22]</xref>. Therefore, particular care is required when interpreting data originating from non-invasive functional data-gathering approaches such as fMRI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Logothetis1">[23]</xref>. Altogether, these arguments call for highly controllable experimental frameworks in which the results and predictions of different functional connectivity analysis techniques can be reliably tested in different dynamic regimes.</p>
<p>A first step in this endeavor consists in simplifying the neuronal system under investigation. For this reason, different studies have focused on <italic>in vitro</italic> neuronal cultures of dissociated neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Eckmann1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Wheeler1">[25]</xref>. Neuronal cultures are highly versatile and easily accessible in the laboratory. Unlike in naturally formed neuronal tissues, the structural connectivity in cultures can be dictated to some extent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Wheeler1">[25]</xref>, and even neuronal dynamical processes can be regulated using pharmacological agents or optical or electrical stimulation. These features have made neuronal cultures particularly attractive for unveiling the processes shaping spontaneous activity, including its initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Maeda1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Orlandi1">[27]</xref>, synchronization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Eytan1">[28]</xref> and plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Wagenaar1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Cohen1">[30]</xref>, as well as self-organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Pasquale1">[31]</xref> and criticality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Tetzlaff1">[32]</xref>. Moreover, some studies also showed that spontaneous activity in <italic>in vitro</italic> preparations shares several dynamical traits with the native, naturally formed neuronal tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Mazzoni1">[33]</xref>.</p>
<p>A second step consists in developing and testing the analysis tools that identify directed functional interactions between the elements in the network. Information theoretic measures such as Transfer Entropy (TE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Kaiser1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Schreiber1">[35]</xref> can capture linear and non-linear interactions between any pair of neurons in the network. TE does not require any specific interaction model between the elements, and therefore it is attracting a growing interest as a tool for investigating functional connectivity in imaging or electrophysiological studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Gourvitch1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Vicente1">[39]</xref>. The independence of TE on assumptions about interaction models has made it adequate to deal with different neuronal data, typically spike trains from simulated networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Kobayashi1">[40]</xref>, multi-electrode recordings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Bettencourt1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Marconi1">[44]</xref> or calcium imaging fluorescence data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Stetter1">[22]</xref>. TE proved to be successful in describing topological features of functional cortical cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Bettencourt1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Garofalo1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Marconi1">[44]</xref>, and in reconstructing structural network connectivity from activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Stetter1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Ito1">[43]</xref>.</p>
<p>In a previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Stetter1">[22]</xref>, we investigated the assessment of excitatory-only structural connectivity from neuronal activity data (with inhibitory synaptic transmission blocked). For this purpose we developed an extension of TE, termed Generalized Transfer Entropy (GTE). To test the accuracy of our connectivity reconstruction method, we considered realistic computational models that mimicked the characteristically bursting dynamics of spontaneously active neuronal cultures. Comparing diverse reconstruction approaches, we concluded that GTE performed superiorly, even when systematic artifacts such as light scattering were explicitly added to our surrogate data. Besides the inclusion of corrections coping with the poor temporal resolution of typical calcium fluorescence recordings, a key ingredient making GTE successful was dynamical state selection, i.e. the restriction of the analysis to a dynamical regime in which functional interactions were largely determined by the underlying hidden structural connectivity. In particular we showed that it was necessary to restrict the analysis to inter-burst regimes, while consideration of bursting epochs led to inference of exceedingly clustered structural topologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Stetter1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here we extend our previous work, by attempting the inference of both excitatory and inhibitory connectivity. Inhibition is a major player in regulating neuronal network dynamics, and the regulation of the excitatory-inhibitory balance is crucial for optimal circuit function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Poil1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Lombardi1">[46]</xref>. In the brain, inhibition shapes cortical activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Isaacson1">[47]</xref>, dominates sensory responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Haider1">[48]</xref>, and regulates motor behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Arber1">[49]</xref>. Severe behavioral deficits in psychiatric diseases such as autism and schizophrenia have been ascribed to an imbalance of the excitatory and inhibitory circuitry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Yizhar1">[50]</xref>. Despite the importance of inhibition, functional connectivity studies often disregard it because of the difficulty in its identification. Hence, unraveling inhibitory connections, and their interplay with the excitatory ones in shaping network dynamics, is of major interest. We show here that the TE-based approach that we previously used for the inference of excitatory connectivity can be extended with virtually no modifications to networks including as well inhibitory interaction, whose dynamics is once again reproduced by realistic computational models for which the ground-truth connectivity is known. We reveal that the most difficult inference problem is not the identification of a link, be it excitatory or inhibitory, but rather the correct labeling of its type. We show that an elevated accuracy of labeling of both excitatory and inhibitory links can be obtained by combining the analysis of network activity in two conditions, a first one where both excitation and inhibition are active, and a second one where inhibition is pharmacologically removed. We show as well, however, that the inference of link types remain extremely uncertain with current experimental protocols. As a perspective solution, we foresee, based on extensive simulations, that significant improvements in both reconstruction and labeling performance could be achieved by enhancing the spontaneous firing of a culture through a weak external stimulation.</p>

<p>Dissociated neurons grown <italic>in vitro</italic> self-organize and connect to one another, giving rise to a spontaneously active neuronal network within a week (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098842-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Eckmann1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Cohen1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Soriano1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Chiappalone1">[52]</xref>.

Activity in neuronal cultures is characterized by a bursting dynamics, where the whole network is active and displays quasi-synchronous, high frequency firing within 100–200 ms windows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Cohen1">[30]</xref>. The timing of the bursts themselves is irregular, with average inter-burst intervals on the order of 10 s in a typical preparation.

<p>Neuronal dynamics in cultures may be monitored using calcium fluorescence imaging (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Eckmann1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Grienberger1">[53]</xref>, which enables the recording of the activity of thousands of individual neurons simultaneously. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098842-g001">Figure 1A</xref> shows example traces illustrating the characteristic fluorescence signal of individual neurons <italic>in vitro</italic>. The fluorescence signal is characterized by a fast onset as a result of neuronal activation and the binding of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ions to the fluorescence probe, followed by a slow decay back to the baseline due to the slow unbinding rate. This behavior is apparent in the population average of the signal, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098842-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, where bursts are clearly identified by the fast rise of the fluorescence signal.</p>
<p>To appraise the role of inhibition on dynamics, we monitor neuronal network activity in two different conditions: A first one, with only excitatory connections active, where inhibitory connections have been completely blocked (denoted as “E–only” networks); and a second one, where both excitatory and inhibitory connections are functionally active (herein after denoted as “E+I” networks). In experiments, inhibitory synapses are silenced through the application of saturating levels of bicuculline, a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). An example trace of the population average signal of such an excitatory-only system is shown in the top left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098842-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, whereas the dynamic behavior in presence of inhibition is shown in the bottom left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098842-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>. In the “E–only” condition, bursts are more pronounced and more regular in amplitude than in the “E+I” condition, an effect also seen in other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Cohen1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Jacobi1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Tibau1">[55]</xref>.</p>
<p>These recordings in neuronal cultures provide a comparison reference for our simulated networks of model neurons. We build a computational model of a culture whose dynamics capture its major qualitative features. These include a high variability in the inter-burst intervals, a low <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> Hz inter-burst firing rate, and, in presence of inhibition, an increase in bursting frequency as well as a general decay in the amplitudes of the fluorescence signal, paired by an increase in their heterogeneity. More specifically, we consider a network of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> leaky integrate-and-fire nodes with depressive synapses in combination with a model for the calcium fluorescence. Network connectivity is random and sparse, with links rewired in order to reach an above-chance level of clustering (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Each node receives inputs from its pre-synaptic neighbors as well as from independent external sources to mimic spontaneous single neuron activity due to noise fluctuations in the ionic current through its membrane. Free model parameters, such as the homogeneous conductance weights of recurrent connections, were calibrated such as to yield dynamics comparable to the biological recordings, with a bursting rate of 0.1 Hz and realistic decay time constants of the calcium fluorescence (see the bottom right panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098842-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The blocking of inhibitory connections (top right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098842-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) is simulated by setting the synaptic weight of all inhibitory connections to zero (note, therefore, that the firing itself of inhibitory neurons is not suppressed, but just its postsynaptic effects).</p>
<p>As discussed more in depth in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Stetter1">[22]</xref>, a hallmark of bursting dynamics is the right-skewed histogram of the population average of the calcium fluorescence signal (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098842-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Low fluorescence amplitudes are associated to the non-bursting regime, which is noise dominated, and the right tail of the distribution reflects bursting events. The range spanned by this right tail is distinctly shortened in presence of inhibition. This difference in the large fluorescence amplitude distribution can be ascribed to the dynamics at the synapse level: For purely excitatory networks, the neurotransmitters resources of a given synapse are depleted during a bursting event <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Cohen2">[56]</xref>. Neurons experience high frequency discharge, but require a longer time to recover, giving rise to long inter-burst intervals. Inhibition lowers this release of neurotransmitters by suppressing neuronal firing before complete depletion, therefore providing a faster recovery, shorter inter-burst periods and lower firing activity inside the bursts.</p>

<title>Reconstructing structural connectivity from directed functional links</title>
<p>Based on simulations of the calcium dynamics in the network, a network of (directed) functional connectivity is reconstructed by computing the Generalized Transfer Entropy (GTE) for each (directed) pair of links (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). GTE is an extension of Transfer Entropy, a measure that quantifies predictive information flow between stationary systems evolving in time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Schreiber1">[35]</xref>. As an information theoretical implementation of the Granger Causality concept <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Granger1">[57]</xref>, a positive TE score assigned to a directed link from a neuron <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to a neuron <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> indicates that the future fluorescence of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> can be better predicted when considering as well the past fluorescence of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in addition to the past of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> itself. We previously introduced GTE to study the reconstructed topology of purely excitatory networks under diverse network dynamical states and signal artifacts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Stetter1">[22]</xref>.

<title>Conditioning as state selection</title>
<p>A central observation that motivated the definition of GTE was the existence of different dynamical states in the switching behavior from asynchronous firing to synchronous bursting activity. The distribution of fluorescence amplitudes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098842-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) provides a visual guide to the relative weight of the single activity events and the bursting episodes. A functional reconstruction in this bursting regime shows a very clustered connectivity due to the tightly synchronized firing of large communities of neurons. We can understand intuitively this finding, by considering that, in the bursting regime, the network is over-excitable and the firing of a single neuron can trigger the firing of a large number of other neurons not necessarily linked to it by a direct synaptic link. On the other hand, the neuronal activity in the non-bursting regime is sparse and dominated by pairwise interactions, and thus, a reconstruction in this regime identifies directed functional interactions that more closely match the structural connectivity (i.e. high GTE might signal direct pre- to post-synaptic coupling in this regime), as previously discussed thoroughly for “E–only” networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Stetter1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>A rough segmentation of the population signal into time sequences of bursting and non-bursting events is simply achieved by defining a fixed <italic>conditioning level</italic> on the population average fluorescence. This simple modification with respect to the original TE formulation, makes GTE suitable for an analysis of functional interactions which distinguish different dynamical regimes, as illustrated for purely excitatory networks in the left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098842-g002">Figure 2A</xref>. The network is indeed considered to be in a bursting regime when the network-averaged fluorescence exceeds the chosen conditioning level (dotted line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098842-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), and in an inter-burst regime otherwise. The value of the conditioning level itself is obtained through the analysis of the fluorescence signal histogram and set close to the transition from the Gaussian-like profile shown for low fluorescence values to the long tail characteristic of the population bursts.</p>

<p>Note that, while our approach works by restricting the analysis to epochs of inter-burst activity only, other complementary methods exploit detailed information about typical burst build-up sequences in order to infer structure, with potentially superior results when the required time resolution is accessible (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Pajevic1">[58]</xref>).</p>

<title>Connectivity reconstruction of simulated “E–only” networks</title>
<p>Reconstruction performances from the GTE computation are quantified in the form of <italic>receiver operating characteristic</italic> (ROC) curves. These curves are obtained as follows: GTE assigns a score to every possible link in the network, and only scores above a given threshold are considered as putative links. These accepted links are then systematically compared with the ground truth topology of the network, and for gradually lower threshold levels. The ROC curves finally plot the fraction of true positives, i.e., inferred connections which really exist, as a function of the fraction of false positives, i.e., wrongly inferred connections.</p>
<p>The ROC curves of the reconstruction performance, with and without conditioning, for the case of simulated “E–only” networks are shown in the left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098842-g002">Figure 2B</xref>. Without conditioning (blue ROC curves), the reconstruction quality of excitatory connections — to both excitatory and inhibitory neurons confounded — is significantly better than a random choice (which would correspond to a diagonal line in the ROC curve). The reconstruction is, however, hindered by the fact that the analysis effectively averages over data from multiple dynamical regimes as described above. The reconstruction performance thus significantly increases by applying a conditioning (red ROC curves) which selects uniquely the inter-burst regime.</p>
<p>It was also shown for simulations comparable to the ones generated as described above, that the reconstructed networks using GTE are approximately unbiased regarding bulk network properties, such as the mean clustering coefficient, or the average length of connections in the network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Stetter1">[22]</xref>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b3">
<title>Connectivity reconstruction of simulated “E+I” networks</title>
<p>An important aspect of Transfer Entropy, and by extension of GTE, is its model-free nature. Thus, during the process of identifying causal influences between neurons, there is no need to define a generative model for neuronal firing or calcium dynamics, as in the case, e.g., of Bayesian inference approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Mishchenko1">[59]</xref>. It follows that we can apply GTE without modifications to the case in which both excitatory and inhibitory links are active, provided that the inter-burst network state can be identified in an analogous way. Indeed we observe that while the presence of inhibition does change the dynamics of the system to some extent, the switching behavior remains robustly present (see the right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098842-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), allowing the straightforward identification of a performing conditioning level.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the reconstruction performance of “E+I” networks remains at high levels after conditioning, of about 80% true positives at 10% false positives, as shown in the right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098842-g002">Figure 2B</xref>. Thus the model-independence of GTE allows the reconstruction of both excitatory and inhibitory links. As a further self-consistency check, we have simulated the dynamics of a neuronal culture with a topology identical to the inferred one and compared it with the dynamics of the network with the original ground-truth topology. The resulting bursting and firing rates, for both the “E-only” and the “E+I” cases, are not statistically significantly different from the case of perfect reconstruction, while they markedly differ from the case of a randomized topology (not shown). Nevertheless, given the phenomenon of structural degeneracy, a large number of even very different structural circuits could give rise to equivalent dynamical regimes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Stetter1">[22]</xref>. Therefore, passing this self-consistency check is not a sufficient condition to prove high reconstruction quality, though it is a necessary one.</p>
<p>Note, finally, that we have disregarded, until now, the identification of the specific type, i.e. excitatory or inhibitory, of each link, focusing uniquely on whether a link is present or absent in the ground-truth structural network, whatever is its nature. As previously mentioned, correctly labeling a link turns out to be a more elaborated task than just inferring its existence.</p>
</sec></sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Distinguishing excitatory and inhibitory links</title>
<p>GTE probes the existence of unspecified influences between signals, but cannot identify the type of occurring interaction <italic>a priori</italic>. Its versatility also means that very different types of interactions can give the same GTE score if their influence in terms of predictability is the same. Hence, to separate between excitatory and inhibitory connections we have to either introduce <italic>ad hoc</italic> information on neuronal types or combine different reconstructions together to single out the different connectivity types.</p>
<p>Such <italic>ad hoc</italic> information might come from dye impregnation, fluorescence labeling or immunostaining <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Lichtman1">[60]</xref>. These techniques identify cell bodies and processes according to some specific traits, for instance membrane proteins or neurotransmitters' receptors. According to Dale's principle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Kandel1">[61]</xref>, a neuron shows the same distribution of neurotransmitters along its presynaptic terminals. Hence, if a neuron is labeled as either excitatory or inhibitory, we can assume that all its output connections are of the same matching type. Thus by combining the type of information provided by some extrinsic labeling technique with the unspecific causal information provided by GTE, the overall set of inferred links can be separated into two non–overlapping subsets of excitatory and inhibitory links.</p>
<p>Being able to identify the type of a neuron — even with perfect accuracy — does not guarantee <italic>a priori</italic> that excitatory and inhibitory links can be inferred equally well. On the contrary, different reconstruction performances have to be expected in general, since the interaction mechanism of excitatory links is inherently different from the inhibitory ones, the former promoting the activity of the target neuron, whereas the latter restrain it. We have tested the accuracy of this <italic>ad hoc</italic> approach through numerical simulations. GTE is applied to the “E+I” data, and the reconstruction quality is assessed separately for the connections originating from neurons of different types (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Non trivially, the results of this analysis indicate that both types of connections are reconstructed with high accuracy (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098842-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). At a fraction of 10% of false positives, excitatory links are detected at a true positive rate of 80%. Inhibitory links show a lesser but still high detection accuracy, of about 60% of true positives.</p>

<title>Reconstructing and labeling connections from spontaneous dynamics</title>
<p>In the absence of information on neuronal types, an alternative approach consists in a direct combination of the reconstructions procured by the “E–only” and “E+I” data on the same neurons. By adding together the GTE scores from the two reconstructions we can assume that the higher scores come from links that show a high score in both reconstructions. This procedure is thus expected to highlight the pool of excitatory connections, since they are the only ones present in both network conditions. Similarly, we can subtract the “E–only” scores from the “E+I” ones. High scores will then now highlight those links that are present in the “E+I” but not in the “E–only” network, i.e. the pool of inhibitory connections.</p>
<p>The performance of this first two-step reconstruction approach is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098842-g003">Figure 3B</xref>. The reconstruction of excitatory connections has a quality as good as the one obtained with <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge of neuronal type based on extrinsic labeling (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098842-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). However, the performance markedly deteriorates for the reconstruction of inhibitory links, since only 40% of the inhibitory connections are correctly identified at 10% of false positives.</p>
<p>Note that an additional complication arises with the described two-steps pipeline. A given link might be attributed a combined score above the inclusion threshold, both when considering the sum <italic>and</italic> the difference of original GTE scores. In this case, the link would be labeled as “both excitatory and inhibitory”, a fact which is excluded by Dale's principle. Despite this problem, we might still try to combine the “E–only” and “E+I” reconstructions to infer the nature of each neuron. To test the accuracy of such identification we try to label neurons as excitatory or inhibitory based on a highly “pure” structural network reconstruction. To do so, we select a very high GTE threshold for link, in such a way that in the inferred subnetwork —including, correspondingly, very few links only— the fraction of false positives remains small (with a maximally tolerable ratio of 5%). We first sum and subtract “E–only” and “E+I” scores to obtain putative excitatory and inhibitory links, as just discussed. We next compute the output degrees of the neurons for each subnetwork, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively. Finally, we rank each neuron according to the difference <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Following Dale's principle, the set of neurons with the highest (positive) ranking would be labeled as excitatory, and those with the lowest (negative) ranking as inhibitory. The results, however, as shown in the inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098842-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, indicate that this approach does not provide better results than a random guessing of neuronal type (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> for details on significance testing) and a different approach is required.</p>

<title>Reconstructing and labeling connections from stimulated dynamics</title>
<p>As a matter of fact, the major challenge for an accurate reconstruction and precise labeling of neuronal types is the identification of inhibitory links, and this for the following reason. To estimate GTE, we need to evaluate the probability of each given neuron to be active in a short time window of a duration <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the order of an assumed Markov approximation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the image acquisition interval. With these parameter choices, we obtain then <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Neurons in a culture spike with an average inter-burst frequency of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, resulting in a low firing probability within each time bin. Continuing this reasoning, the probability that two unconnected neurons spike at random in the same time window is given by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The number of coinciding events <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> expected in a recording is thus:<disp-formula id="pone.0098842.e019"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e019" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the number of independent samples in a recording. In a typical recording session lasting <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> h, one gets <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> independent samples and therefore <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Hence, one can expect to observe, on average, just six concurrent spikes between any pair of unconnected neurons. If an excitatory link exists between two neurons, the conditional probability of firing rises above this random level and more coincidence events are observed, turning into an appreciable contribution to the GTE calculation. However, if an inhibitory link is present, the number of simultaneous spikes gets further reduced with respect to the already very small chance level, making any accurate statistical assessment very difficult. Nevertheless, we note that the number of detected events scales as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with the frequency of firing, and even a slight increase in spiking frequency would enhance considerably the reconstruction performance.</p>
<p>A promising approach to increase neuronal firing consists in forcing the neuronal network through external stimulation. Several studies on neuronal cultures have used external drives, typically in the form of electrical stimulation, to act on neuronal network activity, for instance to investigate connectivity traits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Soriano1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Breskin1">[62]</xref>, modify or control activity patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Wagenaar2">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-vanPelt1">[64]</xref>, or explore network plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Madhavan1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Wagenaar3">[66]</xref>. Such <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches are reminiscent of <italic>in vivo</italic> clinically relevant techniques such as deep brain stimulation, used in the treatment of epilepsy and movement disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-McIntyre1">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Durand1">[68]</xref>.</p>
<p>External stimulation in neuronal cultures has been reported to increase neuronal firing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-vanPelt1">[64]</xref> and to reduce network bursting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Wagenaar2">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Madhavan1">[65]</xref>, a combination of factors that, in the GTE reconstruction context, improve the accuracy in the identification of the network architecture. To explore potential improvements in reconstruction, we simulate the effect of an applied external drive in a purely phenomenological way by increasing the frequency parameter of the Poisson process that drives spontaneous activity. This additional drive never increases the spontaneous firing frequency beyond 3 Hz, being meant to represent the effects of a rather weak external stimulation. Due to this contained increase of firing rate, the collective bursting activity of the simulated network continues to be shaped dominantly by network interactions, rather than by the drive itself.</p>
<p>The performance of our GTE algorithm combined with a weak network stimulation is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098842-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, where we show the fraction of true positives in the reconstruction of “E–only” networks at 5% false positives. The presence of even very small external drives substantially enhances reconstruction based on GTE. For higher drives, reconstruction performance reaches a plateau that quantifies the range of optimum stimulation. Performance later decays due to the excess of stimulation, which substantially perturbs spontaneous activity and alters qualitatively the global network dynamics. We incidentally remark that the incorporation of the external drive makes unnecessary — actually, even deleterious — the instantaneous feedback term correction (IFT, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), i.e., an <italic>ad hoc</italic> modification to the original formulation of TE which was introduced in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Stetter1">[22]</xref> to cope with the poor frame rate of calcium fluorescence recordings, definitely slower than the time-scale of monosynaptic interaction delays. The IFT correction allows to encompass interactions occurring in the same temporal bin of the recording for TE estimation, a feature useful to enhance reconstruction results when the time-scale of pre-postsynaptic neuron interactions is fast relative to the time resolution of the recording. However, same–bin interactions also result in an overestimation of bidirectional connections, since one cannot establish directionality within a single time bin. When the firing rate is enhanced with respect to spontaneous conditions these negative effects of the IFT corrections become predominant.</p>

<p>The same reconstruction analysis for “E+I” networks is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098842-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, for excitatory and inhibitory links separately. The identification of excitatory links greatly improves with moderate drives and, again, IFT becomes unnecessary. For inhibitory links, performance is optimum at low drives, when IFT is used. Without IFT, however, performance is better at relatively high drives, and one can observe the existence of an optimal stimulation range (leading to a firing rate of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> Hz) that maximizes inhibition reconstruction while preserving a relatively good excitatory identification.</p>
<p>We note as well that, for “E+I” networks, bursts disappear in general at higher values of the external drive. In general, as depicted in the inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098842-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, the dependence of the spontaneous firing frequency on the external drive is quantitatively different from “E–only” networks, requiring typically a stronger drive to achieve a comparable firing rate.</p>
<p>With the external drive the overall ROC curves are also improved. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098842-g004">Figure 4C</xref> we show the reconstruction performance for medium values of stimulation. In this new regime, we can again try to determine the neuronal type based on the labeling procedure used in the previous section (inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098842-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Now excitatory neurons are correctly identified with 90% accuracy, whereas the fraction of inhibitory neurons correctly identified rises conspicuously to 60%. This marked improvement is now statistically significant (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098842-g004">Figure 4D</xref> we show an actual reconstruction of a portion of the original network with this procedure. Correctly inferred excitatory and inhibitory neurons are shown in red and blue respectively, and mismatches in yellow. Correctly identified excitatory and inhibitory links are also shown in red and blue respectively, and false positives are shown in black. It is visually evident that for this thresholding level a very high purity is achieved, and only a small fraction of the reconstructed links are false positives.</p>
<p>We conclude that the addition of a weak external stimulation to the “bare” network dynamics results in an overall improvement on the reconstruction of both excitatory and inhibitory links. Moreover, by combining the reconstructions of “E–only” and “E+I” networks, we also become able to infer the neuronal type by just analyzing the dynamics, with no <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge of the system and without resorting to extrinsic information of any sort.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Living neuronal networks contain both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Although the interplay between excitation and inhibition gives rise to the rich dynamical traits and operational modes of brain circuits, inhibition is often neglected when analyzing functional characteristics of neuronal circuits, mostly because of its difficult identification and treatment. In this work we have made a first step towards filling this gap, and introduced a new algorithmic approach to infer inhibitory synaptic interactions from multivariate activity time-series. In the framework of a realistically simulated neuronal network that mimics in a semi-quantitative way key features of the behavior of neuronal cultures, we applied Generalized Transfer Entropy (and Dale's principle) to identify excitatory as well as inhibitory connections and neurons.</p>
<p>In a previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Stetter1">[22]</xref>, we developed the GTE framework and applied it to extract topological information from the dynamics of purely excitatory networks, but left as an open question the treatment of inhibition. Here we have shown that GTE has the potential to be applied without substantial modifications to recordings relative to cultures with active inhibition (“E+I” cultures). This data is characterized by an irregular bursting dynamics with overall lower — but distinctly fluctuating — fluorescence amplitudes as well as higher bursting frequencies than purely excitatory (“E–only”) signals. In general, GTE provided an overall good reconstruction of the “E+I” simulated data, hinting at the robustness and general applicability of the algorithm. This is a highly non trivial achievement of the algorithm, given the profoundly different functional profile of inhibitory actions. The GTE reconstruction alone performed well in identifying the existence of links between pairs of neurons, however, it was not sufficient to resolve their excitatory or inhibitory nature. Yet, we provided evidence through numerical experiments that this additional goal could be fulfilled by retrieving <italic>a priori</italic> information about the types of different neurons (e.g. through immunostaining or selective fluorescent dyes), or by combining the reconstructions obtained from both “E+I” and “E–only” recordings from a same network (thus, again relying uniquely on time-series analysis).</p>
<p>When <italic>a priori</italic> information about the type of each neuron is available, Dale's principle proves to be, at least in our simulations, a solid yet simple approach that allows the identification of the major connectivity traits of the neuronal network. However, when applying Dale's principle to actual, living neuronal networks recordings (see later), one has to consider its possible limitations, like the existence of (rare) exceptions to it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Nicoll1">[69]</xref>. We also remark that, in a more realistic context, other types of <italic>a priori</italic> information beyond the nature of the neurons and their processes could be considered, like, e.g. information about their spatial distribution. Although in this work we have considered only purely random distance-independent topologies, neuronal cultures grow on a bi-dimensional domain, and excitatory connections are typically of shorter range than inhibitory ones. This kind of information could be integrated in the analysis of network models that include metric properties and accounts for spatial embedding (such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Orlandi1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Eckmann2">[70]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Schmeltzer1">[71]</xref>), as well as different connectivity rules for the generation of excitatory and inhibitory sub-networks.</p>
<p>A systematic extrinsic labeling of neuronal types might be difficult to achieve in large culture experiments. When <italic>a priori</italic> information is unavailable, our results show that the combination of the reconstructions for “E–only” and “E+I” spontaneous activity data fails at identifying robustly the inhibitory interactions. Nevertheless, we find that the reconstruction performance of excitatory links remains almost unchanged when inhibition is present, despite the fact that inhibition may substantially alter excitatory interactions, and in turn network dynamics, for instance through feedback and feedforward inhibitory loops. The observation that excitatory links are still correctly reconstructed in “E+I” data shows the robustness of the algorithm to the presence of different interactions in the system. We remark that the main factor determining the poor identification of inhibitory links is the weak firing rate during inter-burst epochs. Since, in a nearly asynchronous regime of inter-burst firing, the action of a direct inhibitory link manifests itself by reducing below the already small chance level the probability of firing coincidence between the two connected neurons, the recording of a larger amount of inhibitory firing would be required to improve the reconstruction of inhibitory couplings. Although the recording duration can be increased at will in numeric simulations, this is not the case for real experimental recordings, to which our algorithm aims at being applied.</p>
<p>In our simulations, we naturally achieved to increase single neuronal firing activity, and therefore reconstruction statistics through a weak external stimulation of the network, with neither a significant disturbance in neuronal network dynamics nor the need for substantially longer recordings. In many previous works resorting to external drives to stimulate network activity, both experimental and theoretical, the applied stimulation was supra-threshold, i.e. the stimulation triggered directly neuronal firing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Soriano1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Jacobi1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Breskin1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Cohen3">[72]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Linaro1">[73]</xref>. Our approach raises instead network excitability by a weak external drive that effectively increases activity without modifying the network intrinsic behavior, in the direction of other experimental studies that stimulated multiple sites of a neuronal culture via a multi-electrodes array, to either increase network firing, reduce the occurrence of bursting episodes, or investigate plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-vanPelt1">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Wagenaar3">[66]</xref>. Interestingly, these works observed that a weak stimulation along few hours did not induce plastic effects, i.e. did not change network behavior, thus making our reconstruction strategy of immediate applicability in experimental recordings.</p>
<p>In the present work we have exhibited experimental data only for qualitative comparison with fluorescence traces obtained from the numerical model. The experimental data could be analyzed in principle without need of any modification to the GTE formulation, but we found our present knowledge of the experimental recordings insufficient to get reliable reconstructions. In particular, we are lacking good estimates of the neuronal firing rate during the inter-burst periods, as well as the amount of fluorescence change caused by an action potential. The former does not allow to determine whether we expect enough events to make the reconstruction of inhibitory links feasible (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0098842.e019">Eq. (1)</xref>), while the latter prevents the application of an optimal data discretization strategy that would reduce the minimal recording length needed for accurate results. Our study intends therefore to foster the future application of the workaround strategies here explored in experiments <italic>in silico</italic>, i.e., most notably: (i) a weak external stimulation to increase spontaneous activity; and (ii) the extrinsic labeling of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal cell bodies after the recording (to provide at least a partial source of <italic>a priori</italic> information) to be used in synergy with our algorithmic approach.</p>
<p>Finally, our reconstruction algorithm has the potential to be immediately applied to the analysis of fluorescence data in experimental recordings that are not affected by the aforementioned limitations. In particular, <italic>in vivo</italic> recordings and brain slice measurements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Mao1">[74]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Dombeck1">[76]</xref> display a much richer activity at the individual neuron level than in the <italic>in vitro</italic> counterparts.

Our methodology can thus be directly applied to these data, particularly in those investigations that target the role of inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Bonifazi1">[80]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Marissal1">[81]</xref>, although systematic verification of the inferred connectivity (in absence of a known ground-truth structure) remains currently out of reach and validation is only possible at the statistical level.</p>

<title>Calcium traces from <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures</title>
<p>Experimental traces of fluorescence calcium signals were obtained from rat cortical cultures at day <italic>in vitro</italic> 12, following the procedures described in our previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Stetter1">[22]</xref> and in other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Orlandi1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Soriano1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Segal1">[82]</xref>. Briefly, rat cortical neurons from 18–19-day-old Sprague-Dawley embryos were dissected, dissociated and cultured on glass coverslips previously coated with poly–l–lysine.

Prior to imaging, cultures were incubated for 40 min in recording medium containing the cell–permeant calcium sensitive dye Fluo-4-AM. The culture was washed with fresh medium after incubation and finally placed in a recording chamber for observation. The recording chamber was mounted on a Zeiss inverted microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu Orca Flash 2.8 CMOS camera. Fluorescence images were acquired with a speed of 50 frames per second and a spatial resolution of 3.4<italic> µ</italic>m/pixel.</p>
<p>In a typical measurement, we first recorded spontaneous activity as a long image sequence 60 min long. Both excitatory and inhibitory synapses were active in this first measurement (“E+I” network). We next fully blocked inhibitory synapses with 40<italic> µ</italic>M bicuculline, a GABA<sub>A</sub> antagonist, so that activity was solely driven by excitatory neurons (“E–only” network). Activity was next measured again for another 60 min. At the end of the measurements, images were analyzed to to retrieve the evolution of the fluorescence signal for each neuron as a function of time.</p>
<p>Note once again that, in this study, experimental fluorescence traces were used only as a guiding reference for the design of synthetic data in “E–only' and “E+I” conditions, and were not analyzed to provide network reconstructions, given the limitations of current experimental protocols, highlighted in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref> section.</p>

<title>Generalized Transfer Entropy</title>
<p>Generalized Transfer Entropy (GTE) was introduced in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Stetter1">[22]</xref> as an extension of the original Transfer Entropy notion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Schreiber1">[35]</xref>.

In the case of fluorescence signals, this state selection is achieved by conditioning the analysis to the regime where the population average of the time series <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is lower than a given threshold <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, i.e.<disp-formula id="pone.0098842.e116"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e116" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(11)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>Here, vectors in time are denoted by their length in brackets, which is equal to the order of Markov order approximation assumed for the underlying process, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The sum is defined over all possible values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the vectors <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The shift variable <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denotes the inclusion of same-bin (instantaneous) interactions for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This adjustment was introduced in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Stetter1">[22]</xref> to cope with the limited time-resolution of calcium fluorescence signals and is dubbed in the text as Instantaneous Feedback Term (IFT) correction. Furthermore, the time-series of calcium fluorescence were high-pass filtered by mean of a discrete difference operator, as a straightforward attempt to enhance the visibility of firing events drowned in noise. Note that GTE reduces to conventional Transfer Entropy for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, i.e. when same-bin interactions are excluded and when the selected state encompasses the whole observed dynamics. The Markov order of the underlying process is here somewhat arbitrarily set to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, following on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Stetter1">[22]</xref> where we extensively checked its effect on the reconstructions: in our previous study, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> resulted to be the lowest dimensionality in the probability distribution allowing to separate actual interactions from signal artifacts like light scattering.</p>
<p>Note that we did not perform any delay embedding of the time-series, because we did not find it here necessary to reach satisfying performance levels, or leading to noticeable improvements. Methodological developments along the lines of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Wibral1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098842-Vicente1">[39]</xref> would be however desirable for future applications to real experimental data.</p>

<title>Optimal binning</title>
<p>The probability distributions in GTE as defined in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0098842.e116">Eq. (11)</xref> were estimated based on discretized values of the temporal difference signal of the observed fluorescence. To cope with potential undersampling artifacts —since the probability distributions to estimate have an elevated dimensionality, as large as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>— we symbolized the signals into a binary sequence, by applying a sharp threshold. The optimal threshold value <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for this conversion was obtained from the following analysis. We first ignored the exponential decay of the fluorescence signal since it has a small influence on discretely differentiated signals, and assumed a sufficiently low firing rate so that the occurrence of more than one spike per frame of a given neuron is negligible. Under these simplification hypotheses, the probability distribution of the signal can be cast as a combination of Gaussian functions, with mean values given by the offset associated to the number of action potentials encountered in the current time bin. Additionally, to preserve information about spiking events when projecting the time-series into a binary representation, we computed the optimal mapping by determining the probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that the mapping is correct at any given time step (provided the parameters of the model <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and a threshold value <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), i.e.:<disp-formula id="pone.0098842.e132"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denotes the occurrence of a firing event at time frame <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e134" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e135" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> refers to unspecified but frozen parameters of the analyzed system, which have a potential influence on the estimated probability. In particular, the probability that a neuron fires at a given image frame is a function of the firing rate and the length of the image frame, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e136" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

<title>Combining two reconstruction results</title>
<p>To distinguish between excitatory and inhibitory neurons, we combined the information of the reconstructions obtained from the “E+I” and “E–only” data, namely <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e165" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e166" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We assumed that excitatory links are present in both datasets, while inhibitory ones appear only in the “E+I” reconstruction, and proceeded by defining new matrices of putative excitatory <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e167" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and putative inhibitory influences <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e168" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, of the form:<disp-formula id="pone.0098842.e169"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e169" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(15)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula id="pone.0098842.e170"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0098842.e170" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(16)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>To obtain the effective connectivity reconstruction only the rank ordering of GTE values is relevant. Therefore no rescaling of these matrices is necessary, and the final set of links could be obtained by thresholding the matrices as described above.</p>
