<title>Background</title>
<p>Metatranscriptomic landscapes can provide insights in functional relationships within natural microbial communities.

<title>Background</title>
<p>High throughput metagenomics have revolutionized our knowledge of microbial communities such as those that populate the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Complementing 16S ribosomal RNA gene-based compositional analyses, metagenome sequencing of these communities provided a broad description of the genetic content and relative abundance of individual members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref006">6</xref>]. The human enterotypes, for instance, have been defined using comparative metagenomic analysis of the human gut microbiomes of 39 individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref005">5</xref>]. Metagenomics, however, does not provide insights in the functional interactions within a complex microbial ecosystem and how these interactions may change in response to an ever-changing environment, including diet. RNA transcript profiling can fill this gap and serve as a proxy for ecosystem responses to environmental cues. Recent advances in massive parallel sequencing of mRNA-derived cDNA sequences (RNA-Seq) has led to an exponential increase of such transcriptome profiling studies. While most RNA-Seq based expression studies focus on a single species, in a number of cases RNA-Seq has been used to profile complex natural microbial communities in marine, soil and human and other mammalian GI tract environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref015">15</xref>]. Analysis of these large complex datasets poses a considerable bioinformatic challenge since natural microbial communities are usually non-restricted with a varying number of participating strains and species. A standard approach is to align the generated RNA-Seq reads to a set of closely related reference genomes or well-annotated metagenomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref014">14</xref>]. This approach works well for the well-studied microbial communities that have a nearly complete catalogue of reference genomes at a small evolutionary distance available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref010">10</xref>]. However, at a larger evolutionary distance, the extensive sequence diversity at nucleotide level between the sample and the reference database significantly reduces the mapping efficiency of the alignment method and increases the probability of spurious assignments.</p>
<p>To overcome these problems a <italic>de novo</italic> assembly method can be used. <italic>De novo</italic> assembly of RNA-Seq reads into contigs increases the information content and therefore grants a more reliable annotation of the expressed genetic content of an unknown microbial community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref017">17</xref>]. Subsequently the newly assembled contigs can be directly used as target sequences in an mRNA-read mapping approach to obtain gene expression data. Currently a number of de Bruijn graph based assemblers have been developed for <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of Illumina sequencing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref019">19</xref>]. Most of them have been designed to work with genomic data from a single species and assume that reads are uniformly sampled along a length of a single genome. As such they cannot efficiently deal with the existence of many co-linear genomic regions in the genomes of strains and species encountered in a non-restricted natural microbial community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref017">17</xref>]. Sequencing errors, exacerbated by authentic microdiversity caused by the coexistence of syntenic strains of the same species in a community and strong sequence conservation of genes common to many species in the community thus can lead to assemblies with a relatively high rate of small contigs and to ambiguous chimeric contigs. Due to the limited size and strong variations in read coverage, statistical analysis methods to assess the correctness of <italic>de novo</italic> metagenome assemblies’ will not reliably work for RNA-Seq derived contigs. Consequently additional verification strategies, such as PCR, are necessary as confirmation of the genetic context predicted by assembled contigs.</p>
<p>The microbiome of the GI tract of healthy human individuals fulfils a variety of beneficial functions for human health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref020">20</xref>]. Numerous studies have linked an altered gut microbiome to disorders in energy and metabolic homeostasis including obesity and diabetes, as well as immune aberrations and excessive inflammation diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref023">23</xref>]. For a systematic study of the influence of diet, environmental factors and host genotype on the microbial diversity in the GI tract, animal models provide an indispensable tool. To this end the mouse model has emerged as one of the preferred model systems. Mouse intestinal microbial communities have been mapped using 16S rRNA gene-based community profiling, and many microbial mouse intestinal commensals have been identified and categorized. Although the phylogenetic makeup of the GI tract microbial communities in human and mouse appear to be similar at phylum level, zooming in at genus and species resolution reveals considerable differences in bacterial composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref025">25</xref>]. The large evolutionary distance of the microorganisms, combined with a strong bias towards human microbiome sequences in the current GI gene catalogs results, as we will show here, in low-resolution outcomes of the analysis of mouse metatranscriptome data with standard alignment methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref013">13</xref>]. Moreover previously single- and paired-end sequencing methods indicated that paired-end sequencing does not gain in performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref010">10</xref>]. This led us to design, validate and implement a <italic>de novo</italic> assembly pipeline for single-end Illumina sequencing using existing assemblers. The method provides better gene assignment results then alignment methods, and we evaluated sensitivity, reliability and validity of the method for the function analysis of complex metatranscriptome data. The generic <italic>de novo</italic> assembly method developed was validated by PCR and using metatranscriptome datasets of community-restricted samples and a spike-in of a human control sample, and enabled a reliable functional profiling and taxonomic binning of samples obtained from the mouse GI tract.</p>

<title>General Workflow, Samples and Data Filtering</title>
<p>A generalized metatranscriptome assembly and analysis pipeline was designed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146423.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Briefly the workflow consisted of filtering RNA-Seq reads for low quality and non-informative reads such as reads derived from ribosomal RNA (rRNA) followed by assembly of the remaining putative ‘mRNA’ reads into contigs, ORF calling and gene-function annotation, taxonomic classification and estimation of gene expression levels by using read-frequency analyses. Since no dedicated metatranscriptome assemblers have been developed so far, performances of several assemblers were evaluated. We have found that the output of the IDBA-UD assembler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref026">26</xref>] was most appropriate for single end metatranscriptome data. Filtering details and assembler performances can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146423.s001">S1 File</xref>.</p>

<p>In order to validate the proposed pipeline, two single-end RNA-Seq metatranscriptome datasets were used. The first RNA-Seq dataset, obtained from an <italic>in silico</italic> generated mock community composed of eight strains, was used for a primary evaluation of the entire workflow. The second RNA-Seq dataset used to further validate the workflow resulted from an <italic>in vivo</italic> study of a restricted intestinal microbial community of limited complexity obtained by the colonization of inbred non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice with Altered Schaedler Flora (ASF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref013">13</xref>]. The datasets were used to estimate precision and recall of the metatranscriptome assembly procedure for functional and taxonomic level assignments respectively. Finally, the pipeline was used to generate functional and taxonomic community profiles of RNA-Seq datasets from natural microbial cecal communities of four C57BL/6J mice that were fed a high-fat high protein diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref027">27</xref>]. To estimate precision and recall of <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies obtained from this complex non-restricted mouse community, RNA-Seq data from a well-characterized sample from the human small intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref010">10</xref>] was used as spike-in control. Technical replicates were available for one of the mouse samples and for the human small intestine sample and included to establish the technical reproducibility of the procedure. Furthermore, PCR followed by Sanger sequencing of the amplified product confirmed the correctness of the sequence of twelve randomly selected mouse derived transcript assemblies.</p>

<title>Metatranscriptome assembly of an <italic>in silico</italic> mock community</title>
<p>An <italic>in silico</italic> mock metatranscriptome was built by merging RNA-Seq data of eight single species transcriptome profiling experiments downloaded from public repositories (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0146423.t001">Table 1</xref>). For each of the selected species a high quality reference genome was available, and RNA-Seq datasets selected were obtained with the Illumina HTS platform using 68 to 107 sequencing cycles. From paired-end datasets an arbitrarily selected single-end dataset was selected. To capture some of the complexity of a true unrestricted community three closely related species from the genus <italic>Streptococcus</italic> where chosen and mixed with five species at a larger evolutionary distance. Furthermore, in this mock community the number of mRNA reads of each of the eight added members was varied mimicking a high variation in species abundance and activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0146423.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Since the mRNA reads in the mock community dataset originate from a specific set of known genomes, the output of the <italic>de novo</italic> assembly workflow can be directly compared with results obtained from a standard alignment procedure. In total 8943 contigs were obtained with the IDBA-UD assembler and their precision at sequence level was assessed by aligning these sequences to the reference genomes. For 86% of these contigs an unambigous high quality full length sequence alignment without insertions or deletions to a reference genome was obtained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146423.s001">S1 File</xref>). The remaining contigs showed a varying degree of nucleotide mismatches at the 5’- and 3’-end of the contig sequences. Since most of these discrepancies were small, the majority of these remaining contigs could still be used for further functional profiling (see below). Only 2% of the assemblies were recognized as a cross-species assembly. Manual inspection showed that these chimeras aligned to sequences that had high levels of conservation among the most closely related species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146423.s001">S1 File</xref>) suggesting that sequence micro-diversity does not have a major impact on the assembly performance, and that a taxonomic classification of metatranscriptome assemblies at genus level and above should be possible. mRNA reads that were not used in the assemblies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0146423.t001">Table 1</xref>) were analysed by a direct alignment with the corresponding reference genomes. In many cases these reads mapped to genes with a small open reading frame (&lt; 100 amino acids) and transcripts of low abundance (data not shown). On basis of our analyses, we estimated that for this mock community a threefold coverage of a gene is required for at least a partial transcript assembly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146423.s001">S1 File</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine the accuracy of the functional profiles obtained by <italic>de novo</italic> assembly, they were compared to profiles obtained by direct genome mapping. Results showed a high congruency (Pearson correlation &gt; 0.99) for the mock community as a whole as well as for each of the individual members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146423.g002">Fig 2</xref>). We compared the KEGG orthology assignment for each read to determine the precision and recall. For functional prediction of assembly assigned reads we calculated a precision score of 0.97 with a recall of 0.94.</p>

<p>For further validation of the pipeline a published RNA-Seq dataset obtained from a defined <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse intestinal community was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref013">13</xref>]. In this study RNA-Seq data was obtained from four inbred non-obese diabetic (NOD) germ-free mice colonized with a defined mixture of eight commensal bacteria (Altered Schaedler Flora; ASF). Twelve cecum and colon samples were prepared using multiple RNA-extraction protocols and sequenced using the Illumina HTS platform. When the RNA-Seq set was published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref013">13</xref>] the complete set of ASF genomes had not been sequenced yet, and to bridge the evolutionary distance to known species a peptide-based alignment procedure was used for functional profiling. Using this procedure the authors were able to link 16% of the sequence reads to a known bacterial gene. Moreover using the Trinity assembler the annotated fractions could be increased to 50.3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref016">16</xref>]. Recently, the draft genome sequences of all eight bacteria in the ASF community have been determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref032">32</xref>], providing the opportunity to validate the metatranscriptome assembly pipeline with a restricted <italic>in vivo</italic> RNA-Seq dataset from a mouse intestinal community.</p>
<p>ASF reads were taken from the SRA repository (SRP012007) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref013">13</xref>], and approximately 5,4 million reads of high quality passed the filtering stage of the pipeline. 1,7 million of these reads could be directly mapped on the recently sequenced draft ASF genomes while 1,5 million reads mapped to the host genome. The origin of the remaining 2,2 million reads could not be established. A blastx search of those unmapped reads against the NR database did not return any significant results. All 5,4 million reads were used for assembly with IDBA-UD to yield 7160 assembled transcripts. The majority (6638) of these contigs could be accurately aligned with one of the eight ASF draft genomes and 256 contigs were derived from the host leaving 266 of the contigs (4%) unaccounted for. The ASF-mapped contigs captured 8688 ORFs that were functionally annotated and compared with a direct mRNA read alignment to the annotated ASF draft genomes following the procedures described above. The result showed a strong correlation (pearson correlation &gt; 0.9) between the expression values obtained from the assembly and the direct-alignment method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146423.g003">Fig 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Even though there were many contaminating reads in these samples that could interfere with the assembly process only a few false positive reads assignments were detected. The precision and recall for functional annotation was 0.97 and 0.58 respectively. The precision was therefore comparable to what was observed for the mock community, whereas the recall is much lower, which is probably due to a much lower sequencing depth of ASF samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146423.s001">S1 File</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally we explored the performance of a taxonomic classification of <italic>de novo</italic> assembled sequences. For a taxonomic classification a two-step procedure was developed. First, from the set of <italic>de novo</italic> assembled sequences from the ASF microbiome a subset of 103 proteins derived from essential single copy genes (ESCG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref033">33</xref>] was identified. This set of marker proteins was used to determine the boundaries of the taxonomic search space by aligning them with the entire NR protein database and further classification using the MEGAN processing pipeline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref034">34</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec014">methods</xref> section for details), In order to mimic the lack of good reference genomes ASF derived protein sequences were excluded. Sixty-seven of 103 marker proteins were classified as proteins belonging to the order of Bacteroidales while 33 belonged to the Clostridiales. Only three marker proteins could not be classified at the order level, and therefore this taxonomic rank was used to restrict the reference database. With the taxonomic boundaries set to the Clostridiales and Bacteroidales, next non-ESCG proteins were classified by aligning them with all Clostridiales and Bacteroidales proteins present in the NR database, again excluding ASF proteins, and classification with MEGAN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146423.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The use of ESCG derived marker proteins to restrict the search space drastically reduced the computational time to classify the full set of proteins. However, low abundant species of different orders may be missed. In this case the presence of members of the Lactobacillales and Defferibacterales, which made up six percent of the mRNA reads in total, was not detected with this method.</p>
<p>Xiong <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref013">13</xref>]used a blastx based alignment procedure to taxonomically assign mRNA reads of the ASF to known bacterial genes. Due to the small read length this method can give rise to many ambiguous assignments. Celaj <italic>et al</italic> showed that the assignment could be substantially improved by using a <italic>de novo</italic> assembly approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref016">16</xref>]. Moreover with large sets of mRNA reads assigned to a taxonomic rank via genome and assembly mapping we can estimate the precision and recall for the assignments via assembly. We assumed that the taxonomic association of a read obtained by a direct genome alignment to an ASF gene summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146423.g003">Fig 3</xref> is true. If via the <italic>de novo</italic> assembly method a different taxonomic association was obtained it was considered to be a false positive association and in case such a read was not incorporated by the <italic>de novo</italic> assembly method or ended up in a taxonomically unclassified contig, it was considered to be a false negative association. For the correctness of a taxonomic classification of ASF proteins via the <italic>de novo</italic> assembly method we estimated a precision of 0.95 for taxonomic ranks down to genus level. The recall score for phylum to order level was 0.66 but was reduced to 0.38 for lower taxonomic ranks (genus &amp; family) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146423.s001">S1 File</xref>). Relative abundance of community members was in very good agreement with those obtained by direct genome mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146423.g003">Fig 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Metatranscriptome assembly of mouse cecum samples</title>
<p>High protein diets are suggested as effective weight loss regimes and therefore would fit in a successful strategy to achieve a long-term weight loss for a positive effect on health and to decrease obesity and associated metabolic disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref035">35</xref>]. To assess whether the here developed metatranscriptome pipeline can be used to study the effects of such diets on a GI tract community, four C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat high-protein diet for 12 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref027">27</xref>]. At the end of the intervention, cecal content was obtained, and the microbial activity present in these samples was analysed by RNA-Seq. Initially, analyses of the mRNA reads employed a previously developed direct alignment approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref010">10</xref>]. However, due to the large evolutionary distance between mouse and human microbiome sequences, and the more limited availability of mouse microbiota associated reference genomes, this procedure resulted in functional and taxonomic information of low resolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146423.s003">S3 File</xref>). To increase the functional and taxonomic resolution the here developed assembly workflow was applied. To monitor precision and recall in this complex and mostly unfamiliar microbial dataset, an RNA-Seq dataset from a well-characterized human small intestinal community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref010">10</xref>] was used as a spike-in control and co-assembled with the mouse RNA-Seq data. This led to a <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of 24077 contigs and allowed for the prediction of 36012 partial and full length ORFs within these contigs. Of these ORFs, 25897 were exclusively derived from the mouse datasets, whereas 9707 were assembled exclusively from the human dataset. A total of 407 hybrid ORFs were assembled consisting of reads obtained from both data sources. Virtually identical results were obtained for the mouse-derived RNA-Seq data when the mouse reads were assembled separately (results not shown). This suggests that a substantial increase in microbial complexity essentially did not influence the outcome of the mouse assembly. Of the RNA-Seq mRNA reads derived from the human small intestine sample, 85% was captured in an assembly whereas this fraction was 61–71% for the mRNA reads derived from the four individual mouse cecum samples. The fraction of the reads that was assigned to an ORF was 80% and 45–55% for the human small intestine sample and mouse cecum samples, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146423.g004">Fig 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146423.s003">S3 File</xref>).</p>

<p>For taxonomic classification the here developed two-step procedure was applied. From the full set ESCG derived marker proteins were identified and used to limit the taxonomic search spaces. Alignment of the full set translated proteins against a thus restricted NR database showed a high level of sequence identity between translated proteins derived from the spike-in control sample and human GI bacterial proteins in the NR database and a low level of sequence identity between mouse GI bacterial proteins and NR bacterial proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146423.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Further taxonomic classification of proteins from the two environments showed that 93% of the human small intestine protein sequences could be classified at family level, while only 48% of the mouse cecum bacterial protein sequences could be classified at this rank. The high level of sequence identity between proteins derived from the <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of the spike-in control and human GI bacterial proteins in the NR database therefore suggested that overall the assembly was accurate.</p>

<title>Validation of assemblies by PCR and Sanger sequencing</title>
<p>To further validate the correctness of the mouse metatranscriptome assembly Sanger sequencig of genomic PCR sequences was used. Twelve transcript assemblies of at least 800 nucleotides were randomly selected for having high and low read coverage of genes expressed in the sample of mouse 2. For each of these assemblies’ two sets of specific primer pairs were designed, and in each case two partially overlapping fragments of the correct size could be amplified using cecal microbial DNA of mouse 2 as template (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146423.s002">S2 File</xref>). For ten assemblies, Sanger sequencing of the amplified DNA returned nucleotide sequences that aligned with 98%-99% identity with the corresponding assembly and thus confirmed the presence of corresponding DNA sequences in the bacterial metagenome. Two PCR products were shown to be a mixture of amplicons originating from isogenic genes. Eight out of the ten correctly sequenced fragments spanned intergenic regions between two coding regions, thus confirming the correct assembly of the genetic context of these genes.</p>

Although the taxonomic profiles of the cecal samples of the four individual mice showed clear differences in relative abundance and distribution of phylotypes the overall COG activity profiles of the four communities were highly similar (0.984–0.999 Pearson correlation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146423.g006">Fig 6</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine whether bacteria from different families fulfilled different roles, homologous proteins of the samples from the C57BL/6J mouse cecum belonging to the four bacterial families with highest number of assigned transcripts, namely the <italic>Clostridiaceae</italic>, <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic>, <italic>Erysipelotrichaceae</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic>, were annotated using KO identifiers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref037">37</xref>], and their cumulative family-specific expression levels were mapped using ipath [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref038">38</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146423.s005">S5 File</xref>). For the four families the results showed distinct differences in their metabolic profile. For example <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> seemed to be active in propionate formation and vitamin B12 biosynthesis, while <italic>Erysipelotrichaceae</italic> appeared to be active in butyrate formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146423.g007">Fig 7</xref>). The <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic> metabolic activity was found to be mainly oriented towards the production of acetate and lactate, a well-established metabolic feature of this bacterial family. Finally, members of the <italic>Clostridiaceae</italic> family did not display a very clear metabolic activity pattern but compared to the other three families appeared to consistently express amino acid degradation pathways at a higher level. The results show that although no close by reference genomes are available for these organisms, robust functional profiles of these community members can still be obtained.

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We have designed and validated a <italic>de novo</italic> metatranscriptome assembly pipeline by using the existing assembler IDBA-UD and performing PCR and sequencing validations on a sample. The pipeline is suitable for analysis of transcriptome data from microbial ecosystems that harbor a degree of diversity such as those encountered in the GI-tract. With this <italic>de novo</italic> metatranscriptome assembly pipeline mRNA reads obtained from RNA-Seq can be assigned to a protein function and a taxonomic rank with high precision. Taxonomic classification on lower ranks remains a major issue for unfamiliar ecosystems harboring many novel species at variable evolutionary distances.</p>
<p>When dealing with familiar ecosystems composed of species that are well represented by complete catalogs of reference sequences at a small evolutionary distance, an assembly strategy will be less efficient due to the required minimal transcript coverage for assembly. However in a community with species that are not well represented in the genome databases, the <italic>de novo</italic> assembly pipeline can outperform direct read alignment methods due to a significant increase in information content of the assembled contigs, which can bridge the phylogenetic distance.</p>

<title>RNA extraction, mRNA enrichment, cDNA synthesis and Illumina sequencing</title>
<p>The cecal intestinal content was collected from four mice on a high fat high protein diet at 10 weeks during the dietary intervention study previously described by Schwarz and co-authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref027">27</xref>], snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. RNA was extracted from 0.1–0.2 grams of cecal content. The content was re-suspended in 500 μL ice-cold TE buffer (Tris-HCL pH 7.6, EDTA pH 8.0). Total RNA was obtained via the Macaloid-based RNA isolation protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref039">39</xref>] with in addition the use of Phase Lock Gel heavy tubes (5 Prime GmbH, Germany) during the phase separation. The RNA purification was done with the RNAeasy mini kit (Qiagen, USA), including an on-column DNAseI (Roche, Germany) treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref039">39</xref>]. The total RNA was eluted in 30 μL ice-cold TE buffer, and the RNA quantity and quality were assessed using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, USA) and Experion RNA Stdsens analysis kit (Biorad Laboratories Inc., USA), respectively. MRNA enrichment was performed by using the mRNA enrichment kit MICROBExpress™ (Ambion, Applied Biosystems, Nieuwerkerk a/d Ijssel, The Netherlands) using the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA quantity and quality were assessed as described above to determine the efficiency of the mRNA enrichment. Double stranded cDNA was synthesized from one μg of the enriched mRNA sample with the SuperScript® Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen, The Netherlands), with addition of SuperScript® III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, The Netherlands) and random priming using random hexamers (Invitrogen, The Netherlands) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146423.ref041">41</xref>]. To remove the RNA an RNAse A (Roche, Germany) treatment was preformed, followed by phenol-chloroform extraction of the cDNA and ethanol precipitation. The product was checked on gel and 3 to 8 μg of cDNA was sent for sequencing (GATC Biotech, Germany). Single read Illumina libraries were prepared from the double-stranded cDNA according to the ChiP protocol with insert sizes between 200–300bp. Sequencing was done with an Illumina Hiseq2000, and each sequence library was barcoded and sequenced at 5pM concentration using the single-end protocol. In total the amount of reads was between 700k and 177 M per sample.

The second step was to classify the remaining proteins by aligning them against a GI restricted database followed by MEGAN classification.
