          <p>Analysis of positively-selected genes can help us understand how human evolved, especially the evolution of highly developed cognitive functions. However, previous works have reached conflicting conclusions regarding whether human neuronal genes are over-represented among genes under positive selection.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Methods and Results</title>
          <p>We divided positively-selected genes into four groups according to the identification approaches, compiling a comprehensive list from 27 previous studies. We showed that genes that are highly expressed in the central nervous system are enriched in recent positive selection events in human history identified by intra-species genomic scan, especially in brain regions related to cognitive functions. This pattern holds when different datasets, parameters and analysis pipelines were used. Functional category enrichment analysis supported these findings, showing that synapse-related functions are enriched in genes under recent positive selection. In contrast, immune-related functions, for instance, are enriched in genes under ancient positive selection revealed by inter-species coding region comparison. We further demonstrated that most of these patterns still hold even after controlling for genomic characteristics that might bias genome-wide identification of positively-selected genes including gene length, gene density, GC composition, and intensity of negative selection.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Humans differ from our closest relative species such as chimpanzees and bonobos in many features including anatomy, physiology, and cognitive functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Carroll1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Roth1">[2]</xref>. Positive selection plays important roles in evolution, especially in creating new phenotypes from ancestral ones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Nielsen1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Enard1">[5]</xref>. Identification and analysis of positively-selected genes help us comprehend how unique human features evolved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Akey1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Tang1">[9]</xref>. The past decades have seen many efforts to explain whether, how and when human Central Nervous System (CNS) evolved, particularly in identifying the events of adaptive evolution in human brain-related genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Wang1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Nielsen2">[14]</xref>. However, previous works have reached conflicting conclusions. Wang <italic>et al</italic>. reported that about 15% positively-selected genes were in the Gene Ontology (GO) category of neuronal functions, indicating overrepresented human brain-related evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Wang2">[11]</xref>, but other works did not find such enrichments in neuronal GO categories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Consortium1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Bakewell1">[16]</xref>. Nielsen <italic>et al</italic>. also observed that genes under positive selection did not show an excess tendency of brain expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Nielsen2">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Genome-wide identification of genes under positive selection has been based on two types of data, inter-species divergence and intra-species polymorphism, either independently or in combination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Jensen1">[17]</xref>. In divergence-based analyses, the sequences of protein-coding regions from related species were aligned and compared, and the loci with more function-altering changes in one or more lineages are considered to be under positive selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Arbiza1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Clark1">[18]</xref>. In contrast, the polymorphism-based approaches, such as F<sub>ST</sub> and iHS, using population genetic data from a single species, aimed to identify sites that meet the pattern of selective sweep, and contained both the positively-selected targeting allele and the linked neutral alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Voight1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Grossman1">[21]</xref>. Recently, many researchers have noted that these two approaches show considerable detection bias: divergence-based approaches focus on detecting fixed adaptive coding changes that occurred near the human-chimp split, while polymorphism-based approaches detect more recent adaptive events in both coding and regulatory regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Nielsen1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Biswas1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Akey1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Zhai1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-MorenoEstrada1">[25]</xref>. Sabeti <italic>et al</italic>. described this detection bias in detail, and proposed a grouping rule for existing identification approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Sabeti1">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this paper, we resolved the conflicting conclusions about positive selection of human neuronal genes. By using a meta-analysis approach, we demonstrated that brain-related genes were enriched among positively-selected genes identified by polymorphism-based genomic scan but not divergence-based coding region comparison, suggesting recent brain adaptation in the human lineage. We further showed that most of our observations could not be accounted for by the potential detection biases induced by gene length, gene density, GC composition and intensity of negative selection. Our conclusions were shown to be robust when different datasets, parameters, and analysis pipelines were used.</p>

        <title>Collection of human positively-selected genes and genomic regions</title>
        <p>We integrated human positively-selected genes identified in previous academic publications, and then grouped them by different identification approaches. To the best of our knowledge, no meta-analysis protocol in studying human positive selection existed, and we developed our meta-analysis pipeline in accordance with the PRISMA Statement (see details in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0061280.s009">Text S1</xref></bold>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Moher1">[26]</xref>. In particular, the candidate publication list was retrieved by (i) querying “(positive OR natural OR nonneutral OR adaptive) AND (selection OR evolution) AND genom* AND human” in PubMed with publication date prior to 2011 and (ii) viewing more than 100 review papers about natural selection. Among more than 3700 publications retrieved, twenty-seven publications identified human positively-selected genes at the whole-genomic level were collected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061280-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). We ruled out publications on single-gene analysis in order to avoid ascertainment bias. The gene list was then extracted from these 27 articles, using the identification criteria defined by the original authors (see details in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0061280.s010">Text S2</xref></bold>), and unofficial gene symbols were curated by Gene Name Service <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Lin1">[27]</xref>. These genes were then divided into four groups referring to approaches used to identify positive selection, following the general dividing rule in two reviews <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Sabeti1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Hurst1">[28]</xref>: Group 1, a high proportion of function-altering mutations; Group 2, a reduction in genetic diversity; Group 3, a different allele frequency between subpopulations; and Group 4, a long haplotype (<bold>Dataset S1</bold>). Grossman <italic>et al</italic>. developed a composite method integrating multiple signatures of intra-species polymorphism to identify 179 positively-selected genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Grossman1">[21]</xref> which were specifically assigned to Group “composite” (<bold>Dataset S1</bold>). We also created a stringent subset of positively-selected genes by collecting only genes identified by two or more studies within each group, and we used it to confirm that our main conclusions still remained.</p>

        <title>Analysis of gene expression data</title>
        <p>Two different datasets of expression data, one from mRNA-SEQ and one from cDNA microarray experiments, were analyzed independently to confirm the results.</p>
        <p>mRNA-SEQ data was downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genes.mit.edu/burgelab/mrna-seq/" xlink:type="simple">http://genes.mit.edu/burgelab/mrna-seq/</ext-link>, which contained transcriptional data of up to 23115 genomic loci in 22 human tissue or cell-line samples, and the RPKM algorithm was applied to evaluate expression levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Wang3">[29]</xref>. The nine tissues obtained from the same source and with comparable reads depth, including adipocyte, brain, heart, liver, lymph node, skeletal muscle, testis, breast, and colon, were used for further analyses. We defined whether the expression of a gene was biased in any tissue by cutting an estimated 2.5% upper-tail of the expression spectrum among all tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Daszykowski1">[30]</xref>. A gene with expression value in a tissue larger than M+2×MAD would be considered biased-expressed in this tissue, where M and MAD were defined as follows:<disp-formula id="pone.0061280.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0061280.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where x indicates the expression values for the corresponding gene among all tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Chung1">[31]</xref>. To rule out artifacts from thresholds, we later re-set the threshold to “3×median” and obtained similar results (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0061280.s001">Figure S1A and B</xref></bold>).</p>
        <p>A cDNA microarray dataset GSE1133, which profiled 79 human tissues and cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Su1">[32]</xref>, was downloaded from NCBI GEO database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Barrett1">[33]</xref> and analyzed with R and Bioconductor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Gentleman1">[34]</xref>. Specifically, we used GCRMA for background subtraction, normalization and probe summarization, followed by using Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS5; Affymetrix) to call presence or absence. We chose seven tissues which had corresponding mRNA-SEQ data, including adipocyte, brain, heart, liver, lymph node, skeletal muscle, and testis, with two additional tissues, lung and pancreas, to constitute a nine-tissue group. The expression data of 17 CNS regions were also extracted. Probe sets without a MAS5 presence call in any of the nine tissues were excluded. We confirmed that this filtering did not change our conclusions (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0061280.s001">Figure S1C</xref></bold>). The same “M+2×MAD” threshold was set to classify whether the gene expression was considered to be biased in a specific tissue. To convert transcriptomic data from probe-set-level into gene-level, the probe-set IDs were converted into Ensembl gene identifiers by using the annotation file of U133A and GNF1H downloaded from BioGPS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Wu1">[35]</xref>, and a gene with at least one probe-set supporting biased expression in a tissue was considered as biased in that tissue at the gene-level. After probe-to-gene conversion, 16832 genes were annotated with Boolean tags indicating whether the gene's expression was biased in each of the nine tissues, and this gene-level data was used in subsequent analyses.</p>

Gene density of each gene was measured as the number of genes locating within 100 kb upstream and downstream of a given gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Enard2">[37]</xref>. GC composition was also calculated for each gene together with its 100 kb flanks in both sides.

        <p>We mapped 4357 grouped positively-selected genes into two tissue expression datasets, mRNA-SEQ and cDNA microarray. Genes without expression data were excluded from subsequent statistical tests. A 2×2 contingency table was built for each tissue and each group of positively-selected genes by considering (i) whether a gene was biased expression in certain tissue and (ii) whether it was identified as positively-selected in a certain group. Two-tailed Fisher's exact test was carried out for each contingency table. To adjust Fisher's exact test for multiple testing, the Benjamini and Hochberg FDR corrected P-value was calculated for each test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Benjamini1">[39]</xref>. Since Fisher's exact test is sensitive to the total gene number, we also calculated odds ratios (OR) to evaluate the degree of under-representation or enrichment between positive selection and tissue-biased expression.</p>
        <p>The correlation between positive selection and brain expression might be accounted for by the genomic characteristics such as gene length, gene density, GC composition and intensity of negative selection. To explore the influence of such factors, we re-calculate the OR after controlling each factor separately by using the strategy of “permutation in quantiles”, referring to Enard <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Enard2">[37]</xref>. In detail, we first divided the genes into several classes, delimited by the quantiles of one of the four factors, then permutated whether a gene was positively-selected within each class, and finally re-calculated the OR after each permutation. The distributions of permutated log10(OR) were generated by 1000 replicates of permutation, and the mean and standard deviation (s.d.) were calculated for each distribution. <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0061280.s002">Figure S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0061280.s003">S3</xref></bold> showed that dividing genes into 15 classes was sufficient in both mRNA-SEQ and cDNA microarray datasets since the mean and s.d. of log10(OR) were not altered much when more classes were used.</p>

        <p>Existing methods to identify genes under positive selection may have relatively high rates of false positives. To confirm the validity of the pattern we observed above, we repeated the analyses using only genes identified by two or more studies to be positively selected in each group. The odds ratio analysis showed that Group 1 genes became more under-represented in brain-biased expression (OR = 0.36 vs. 0.58) and Group 3 and 4 showed stronger enrichment (OR = 2.56 vs. 1.39 and 2.35 vs. 1.47, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061280-g002"><bold>Figure 2C</bold></xref>).</p>

However, two CNS regions, cerebellum and cerebellar peduncles, did not follow this pattern. None of their corrected P-values for Group 4 reached the significance level of 0.05 in these two regions. In fact, cerebellum and its related regions contributed less to human high-level cognitive functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Rakic1">[46]</xref>.

        <title>The brain under-representation and enrichment could not be explained by the detection biases induced by genomic characteristics</title>
        <p>The relatively high false positive rate of existing identification approaches for positively-selected genes raised concerns that the observed brain enrichment and under-representation may be due to some detection biases towards or against brain-related genes. To address this concern, we first analyzed the genomic characteristics of these four groups of positively-selected genes with respect to gene length, gene density, GC composition and intensity of negative selection. Group 1 had almost the same median gene length compared with all human genes, whereas all other groups based on intra-species had significantly longer gene length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061280-g003"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>). Group 3 and 4 had smaller gene density and all groups except Group 1 had less nucleotide composition of C and G than genome background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061280-g003"><bold>Figure 3B and 3C</bold></xref>). Consistent with the signatures of ancient positive selection, Group 1 genes showed a significant excess of dN/dS to genome-wide average; however, this is not the case in other groups of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061280-g003"><bold>Figure 3D</bold></xref>). In summary, Group 1 positively-selected genes clearly differed from other intra-species groups in all the four genomic characteristics, suggesting an unnegligible detection bias between inter-species and intra-species identification approaches.</p>

        <p>We next addressed whether these detection biases could account for the observations that brain-biased expression was under-represented in Group 1 and enriched in Group 3 and 4. To quantify the influence of such detection biases, all human genes were divided into 15 classes by quantiles of one of the four genomic characteristics, and then permutated whether a gene was positively-selected within each class individually (see details in <bold><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref></bold>, referring to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Enard2">[37]</xref>). Analysis of mRNA-SEQ dataset showed that the observed OR of Group 1 was significantly smaller than expected by chance after controlling any of the four genomic characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061280-g004"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. On the other hand, although the observed ORs in Group 3 and 4 did not reach the significance level of 0.05 when we controlled gene length, they were larger than the averages in permutated distributions when controlling all four genomic factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061280-g004"><bold>Figure 4C and 4D</bold></xref>). The same conclusions could also be drawn from cDNA microarray dataset (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0061280.s005">Figure S5</xref></bold>). These results suggested that the under-representation of brain-expressed genes in Group 1 could not be explained by the influence of any of the four factors, whereas the observed enrichment in Group 3 and 4 was, to some extent, affected by the gene length bias. Nevertheless, it still could be seen that the real enrichment level was higher than expected by chance, and more analysis might be required to verify the recent positive selection in human brain evolution.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We present a clearer picture of positive selection in the human lineage, with the conclusion that major evolutionary changes in different tissues and different functional groups occurred predominantly at particular time periods, some near the chimpanzee-human divergence and others much more recently. Our analyses of expression patterns and functional categories consistently support recent adaptation in the human brain. After controlling the notable detection biases induced by four genomic characteristics, we could still observe an excess of recent brain evolution from expression data, and these results were further supported by functional category enrichment analysis. Our results provide explanations of previously conflicting results about the evolution of brain-related positively-selected genes.</p>
      <p>Previous studies based on inter-species divergence have reported that brain-related GO categories were not enriched in human positive selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Consortium1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Bakewell1">[16]</xref>, and they are consistent with our finding that Group 1 positively-selected genes indeed showed under-representation of brain-biased expression. It has been noticed that such divergence-based approaches focused on searching signals of positive selection in protein-coding regions and lacked the power to detect adaptive changes in regulatory regions. Notably, Haygood <italic>et al</italic>. had reported brain-related enrichment by scanning the evolutionary substitutes in promoter regions between human and chimpanzee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Haygood1">[47]</xref>. Although we have shown that divergence-based identification approaches seem not to suffer a lot from genomic context, we cannot exclude the possibility that other factors might contribute to the under-representation of brain-related genes, such as more frequent evolutionary changes occurred in regulatory regions of brain-related genes instead of their protein-coding regions.</p>
      <p>One may raise the concern that our enrichment analysis might have more power to detect brain-related processes if brain-related genes are with a larger number and are well-annotated in GO database. Here, we addressed this concern from two aspects. Firstly, we demonstrated that the number of brain-expressed genes (n = 3188) was not the most among all the tissues we used (n ranges from 1201 to 5529); in addition, GO annotation did not show preference for brain-expressed genes, compared with all human genes (87% vs. 86%). Secondly, in addition to Fisher's exact test, we used OR as an alternative estimate which is less sensitive to the number of input gene, and our findings of brain enrichment pattern remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061280-g002"><bold>Figure 2C</bold></xref><bold> and</bold> <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0061280.s008">Table S3</xref></bold>). As a result, the observed brain enrichment is unlikely to be led by the difference of statistical power.</p>
      <p>It should be noted again that existing genome-wide approaches to identify positively-selected genes have relatively high false positive rate; thus the statistical signals of under-representation or enrichment might be diluted, which made us potentially missed some true signals. This might be an explanation why we could not find any enrichment signals in Group 2 positively-selected genes. Our results also emphasize that the characteristics of genomic context should be considered seriously when we interpret the result generated from such genome-wide scans. For instance, the genes with larger gene size would have more chance to overlap with any windows in genomic scans. The lessons learned from this study might inform future genome-wide studies. Strictly speaking, the genes under positive selection that we analyzed here are in fact genes under “putative” positive selection.</p>
      <p>After controlling gene length, the permutation results of both tissue expression and functional categories enrichment analyses suggested an excess of brain-related adaptation in Group 3 and 4, whereas the significance level reached 0.05 in many neuronal GO terms but not in brain-biased expression. This raised a possibility that, if the recent adaptive brain evolution had occurred only in some particular brain functions, the enrichment signal might be diluted when globally considering all brain-expressed genes. The hierarchical GO system provided us an opportunity to test the enrichment in many sub-classified gene functions, which may lead to higher sensitivity to detect the enrichment signal of positive selection.</p>
      <p>In this study, we primarily addressed the conflicts about adaptation in the human brain. However, genes involved in testis and spermatogenesis were also reported having experienced adaptive evolution identified by inter-species divergence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Nielsen2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Kosiol1">[23]</xref>. We found a weak enrichment of testis-biased expression in Group 1 from mRNA-SEQ dataset (corrected P-value = 0.07 and OR = 1.19), but it was not supported by cDNA microarray dataset (corrected P-value = 0.69 and OR = 0.90). The discordance between two expression datasets asks for further studies in the future. We did not find testis enrichment in the latter three groups from either mRNA-SEQ or cDNA microarray dataset. Consistent with the previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Consortium1">[12]</xref>, we found that immune-related functions were enriched only in Group 1 positively-selected genes, but not in the latter three groups. By developing a method to identify adaptive evolution at single SNP resolution, Fumagalli <italic>et al</italic>. found that immune-related functions were involved in subpopulation divergence and adaptation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Fumagalli1">[48]</xref>. This discovery supports our point that reducing the false positive rate of identification approaches might provide more insights into human evolution.</p>
      <p>With the advances of next-generation sequencing, the statistical power to detect events of positive selection will be benefited when more primate genomes are sequenced and individual human genomes are re-sequenced at greater coverage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061280-Sabeti1">[24]</xref>. Eventually, continuous progress in this area will enable us to decode a clearer picture of human evolution.</p>
