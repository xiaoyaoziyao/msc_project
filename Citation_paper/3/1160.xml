<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) triggers a series of neuroinflammatory processes that contribute to evolution of neuronal injury. The present study investigated the neuroprotective effects and anti-inflammatory actions of berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid, in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> TBI models. Mice subjected to controlled cortical impact injury were injected with berberine (10 mg·kg<sup>−1</sup>) or vehicle 10 min after injury. In addition to behavioral studies and histology analysis, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and brain water content were determined. Expression of PI3K/Akt and Erk signaling and inflammatory mediators were also analyzed. The protective effect of berberine was also investigated in cultured neurons either subjected to stretch injury or exposed to conditioned media with activated microglia. Berberine significantly attenuated functional deficits and brain damage associated with TBI up to day 28 post-injury. Berberine also reduced neuronal death, apoptosis, BBB permeability, and brain edema at day 1 post-injury. These changes coincided with a marked reduction in leukocyte infiltration, microglial activation, matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity, and expression of inflammatory mediators. Berberine had no effect on Akt or Erk 1/2 phosphorylation. In mixed glial cultures, berberine reduced TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling. Berberine also attenuated neuronal death induced by microglial conditioned media; however, it did not directly protect cultured neurons subjected to stretch injury. Moreover, administration of berberine at 3 h post-injury also reduced TBI-induced neuronal damage, apoptosis and inflammation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Berberine reduces TBI-induced brain damage by limiting the production of inflammatory mediators by glial cells, rather than by a direct neuroprotective effect.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) triggers a series of neuroinflammatory processes that contribute to neuronal injury and failure of functional recovery . Post-traumatic inflammation is mediated by the activation of microglia and astrocytes and infiltration of circulating leucocytes into the affected area. Activated glia produce multiple pro-inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Overproduction of these mediators is toxic to neighboring neurons, which further activates glial cells and injures the remaining neurons through positive feedback <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Barreto1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Block1">[2]</xref>. Neurotoxic proinflammatory cytokines can activate receptor-dependent apoptotic pathways via recruitment of adaptor molecules and caspase-8 or -10 activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Jara1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Haase1">[4]</xref>. Thus, inhibition of glial activation and, therefore, production of inflammatory mediators may be a potential therapeutic strategy for protecting the damaged brain in TBI. Although a number of drugs targeting inflammatory pathways following TBI have been tested in clinical trials, none has conferred a significant benefit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-McConeghy1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid isolated from medicinal herbs frequently used in traditional Eastern medicine, has multiple therapeutic effects for metabolic disorders, microbial infection, neoplasms and inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Kulkarni1">[6]</xref>. Increasing interest has focused on its anti-inflammatory effects. In microglia, berberine suppresses neuroinflammatory responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Lu1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Jia1">[8]</xref> and attenuates the production of inflammatory mediators through suppression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling in animal models of endotoxemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Zhang1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Li1">[10]</xref>. Substantial evidence also shows that berberine exerts neuroprotection in cerebral ischemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Song1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Hu1">[15]</xref> and Alzheimer's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Durairajan1">[16]</xref>. However, the therapeutic effect of berberine on TBI has yet to be evaluated, and the effective time at which berberine can be administered post-injury has not been investigated in preclinical studies as previous studies have administered it either prior to or shortly after onset <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Song1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Hu1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of berberine in a mouse model of TBI. We also examined whether it attenuated TBI-induced glial activation, thereby preventing neuronal damage in both cell and animal models.</p>

<title>Material and Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>Male C57BL/6J mice (age 8–10 weeks, weight 23–28 g) were obtained from National Laboratory Animal Center (Taipei, Taiwan). All study protocols were approved by the Animal Research Committee at Cheng Hsin General Hospital (Animal permit number CHGH-97-02), and were conducted according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85–23, revised 1996). The results of all studies involving animals are reported in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines for reporting experiments involving animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Kilkenny1">[17]</xref>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Experimental protocol</title>
<p>All animals were randomized into one of the three following groups by using computer-generated random numbers: (i) sham injury, (ii) controlled cortical impact (CCI) + vehicle, and (iii) CCI +10 mg·kg<sup>−1</sup> berberine. All measurements described below were also performed in a blinded manner. Berberine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) dissolved in 0.9% saline (0.2 mL) or a corresponding volume of vehicle (0.9% saline) was administered intraperitoneally 10 min following injury.</p>
<p>The following measurements were assessed at the indicated time points following injury: 1) behavioral testing at days 1, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 (n = 12/group); 2) cresyl violet staining at 2 h, days 1 and 28 (n = 6–8 mice/group); 3) histology, brain water content, Evans blue (EB) dye extravasation, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 zymography, Western blot analysis, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at 6 h, 12 h, day 1 or day 4 (n = 5–7 mice/group); and 4) real–time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at 6 h (n = 7 mice/group). The dose and route of berberine were selected based on previous work in experimental cerebral ischemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Song1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Zhang2">[14]</xref> and our pilot study in which concentrations of 5, 10, and 15 mg·kg<sup>−1</sup> were tested; both 10 mg·kg<sup>−1</sup> and 15 mg·kg<sup>−1</sup> improved behavioral deficits but there was no significant difference between the two groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115694.s001">S1 Fig</xref>.).</p>
<p>Another set of experiments was performed to investigate the delayed therapeutic potential of berberine for TBI. Berberine or vehicle was delivered intraperitoneally at 3 h post-injury, and the protective effects were assessed using cresyl violet staining, Fluoro-Jade B (FJB) histology, cleaved caspase-3 Western blot (n = 6 mice/group) and ELISA at day 1 (n = 7 mice/group).</p>

<title>Controlled cortical impact injury</title>
<p>The CCI model was employed to induce TBI as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Chen1">[18]</xref>. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (65 mg·kg<sup>−1</sup>; Rhone Merieux, Harlow, UK), and a 5-mm craniotomy was performed over the right parietal cortex. CCI was produced using a pneumatic piston with a 2.5 mm-rounded metal tip, velocity of 4 m/sec and depth of 2 mm. The bone flap was immediately replaced and sealed, and the scalp was sutured closed. Body temperature was monitored throughout the surgery by using a rectal probe; temperature was maintained at 37.0±0.5°C using a heated pad. Mice were placed in a heated cage to maintain body temperature while recovering from anesthesia.</p>
<p>Sham-operated animals underwent the same procedure as the injured mice with the exception of CCI.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d">
<title>Metabolic characteristics assessment</title>
<p>Mice were anesthetized with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (80 mg·kg<sup>−1</sup>, ip), and right atrial puncture was performed to collect venous blood. The collected blood was centrifuged (3500 g for 5 min), and the serum was stored on ice until analysis. Serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (CRE), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were measured by a chemistry autoanalyzer (Synchron Clinical System LX20; Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) to assess renal and liver functions.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2e">
<title>Behavioral testing</title>
<p>Behavioral testing was conducted prior to and at 1, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after CCI. Animals were pre-trained for 3 days for both the rotarod and beam walking tests.</p>
<p>For the rotarod test, an accelerating rotarod was employed to assess motor function and balance in mice as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Chen2">[19]</xref>. The rotarod speed was slowly increased from 6 to 42 rpm within 7 min, and the time during which the animals remained on the rotarod was recorded.</p>
<p>The beam walking test assessed fine motor coordination and function by measuring the ability of the animals to traverse an elevated narrow beam as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Chen2">[19]</xref>. The time for the mouse to cross the beam (not to exceed 60 s) was recorded. For the rotarod and beam walking tests, three measurements per trial were recorded 1 h before CCI (baseline) and at each tested time-point after CCI.</p>
<p>The modified neurological severity score (mNSS) is a composite index of motor, sensory, reflex, and balance tests. One point was given for the inability to perform each test or for the absence of a reflex. Neurological function was graded on a scale of 0–18 where a normal score was 0, and a maximal deficit score was 18.</p>

<title>Histology and immunohistochemistry analyses</title>
<p>Mice were terminally anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (80 mg·kg<sup>−1</sup>, ip) and perfused transcardially with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. Brain specimens were processed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Chen2">[19]</xref>. Frozen sections (10 µm) were stained with cresyl violet, FJB (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA), a marker of degenerating neurons, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL; In situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Chen3">[20]</xref>. For immunostaining, sections were incubated with the respective primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal anti-myeloperoxidase [MPO], a neutrophil marker [Dako, Cambridge, UK], or rabbit anti-ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 [Iba1], a microglia/macrophage marker [Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan], or CD45, a marker for blood-born monocytes [BD Biosciences Pharmigen, San Jose, CA, USA]). Antibody information is listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0115694-t001">Table 1</xref>. The specificity of staining reaction was assessed in several control procedures, including omission of the primary antibody and substitution of the primary antibody with nonimmune rabbit or rat serum.</p>

TBI induced a significant impairment in both rotarod and beam walk performance at all tested time points in the vehicle-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115694-g001">Fig. 1B and C</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115694-g008">Fig. 8</xref>, berberine treatment at 3h significantly reduced contusion volume (18.5±0.7 vs. 21.7±0.6 mm<sup>3</sup>; <italic>P</italic> = 0.006; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115694-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>) and the number of FJB-positive neurons around the injured cortical area (55.8±2.3 vs. 72.7±2.5 cells/field; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115694-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>) compared to vehicle at day 1 post-injury.

Therefore, the neuroprotective effect of berberine treatment at 10 min or 3 h post-CCI was similar; contusion volume, neuronal damage and the degree of apoptosis were reduced by 14.5%, 19.4% and 45.7% when administered 10 min post-injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115694-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) and 14.7%, 23.2% and 41.8% when administered at 3 h post-injury, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115694-g008">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>

<p>We further determined whether delayed berberine treatment also reduced the expression of inflammatory mediators.

The anti-inflammatory effect of berberine treatment at 3 h is similar to that at 10 min post-injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115694-g005">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study showed for the first time that berberine administration reduced neuronal damage and cerebral edema and improved long-term functional recovery after TBI in mice. Of particular translational significance, protection was observed even when berberine was administered 3 h post-injury. Mechanistically, berberine reduced neutrophil infiltration, microglial activation and the mRNA and protein expression of pro-inflammatory mediators; however, it did not affect Akt or Erk signaling <italic>in vivo</italic>. In the <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, we found that berberine did not directly reduce neuronal cell death in the stretch-injury model. However, berberine attenuated IL-1β-stimulated NO production in both primary mixed glia and the BV-2 cell line, which was associated with a reduced activation of TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling in mixed glia. Conditioned media from IL-1β-stimulated BV-2 cells caused death in N2A cells, but treating IL-1β-stimulated BV-2 cells with berberine reduced neuronal cell death induced by microglial conditioned media. Taken together, berberine might reduce TBI-induced tissue damage by limiting the levels of inflammatory mediators produced by glial cells, rather than through a direct neuroprotective effect. Our results support the notion that inhibition of glia-mediated inflammation could protect against neuronal damage following TBI.</p>
<p>A single injection of berberine administered post-CCI enhanced the functional recovery in mice, which was observed as long as 1 month post-injury. Previous pharmacokinetic studies of berberine in rats revealed that it rapidly penetrates the BBB by 0.2 h after administration, peaking at 2–4 h in the brain, and was eliminated slowly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Wang2">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Wang3">[36]</xref>. Thus, it is possible that a single injection of berberine conferred protection by attenuating the production of inflammatory mediators released from glial cells. Indeed, IL-β or IL-6 may affect the expression of other pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines during the early stages post-injury, thus amplifying the inflammatory response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Das1">[37]</xref>. Our results are in agreement with previous reports in animal models of cerebral ischemia, which demonstrate that prophylactic or early berberine treatment can reduce brain tissue damage and neurological deficits at early time points (less than one week) following stroke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Song1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Hu1">[15]</xref>. The sustained neuroprotective effect of berberine for TBI observed in the present study is particularly important because cerebral injuries arising from different types of primary insults could cause diverse injury cascades and cellular vulnerability patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Bramlett1">[38]</xref>. The long-term protection is also of great clinical relevance since some agents slow down rather than prevent neuronal death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Gladstone1">[39]</xref>. Furthermore, our observation that delayed berberine administration (3 h post-injury) was sufficient to induce improvement further suggest that berberine may provide a potential therapy for TBI that is clinically feasible.</p>
<p>Interestingly, berberine reduced neuronal death following mouse TBI; however, it did not protect neurons in the <italic>in vitro</italic> stretch injury model. Although berberine also attenuated cleaved caspase 3 expression, it did not alter the phosphorylation of either Akt (both Ser 473 and Thr 308) or Erk. These results contradict previous reports from cerebral ischemia in which enhanced Akt Ser 473 phosphorylation protected neurons from apoptosis following berberine treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Hu1">[15]</xref>. It is possible that berberine can influence Akt activation that is specific for different pathological conditions. Indeed, previous studies have shown that berberine did not alter phosphorylation of Akt at either Ser473 or Thr308 in cultured endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Wang4">[40]</xref>; however, it suppressed cytokine-induced activation of Akt in colon cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Amasheh1">[41]</xref>. Also, the Akt activation reported in previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies was observed in cultured neurons subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Chai1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Hu1">[15]</xref> while the main insult arising from TBI in our study was mechanical stretching. An alternate explanation is that TBI may not induce the expression of heat shock protein 90 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Truettner1">[42]</xref>, which is required to maintain Akt stability under stress conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Sato1">[43]</xref>.</p>
<p>We showed that berberine attenuated microglial activation and neutrophil infiltration, and reduced the expression of inflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-1β, IL-6, MCP-1, and MIP-2) in the injured brain. These <italic>in vivo</italic> findings correlated with the inhibition of IL-1β-induced upregulation of iNOS and COX2 and production of IL-6 and MIP-2 in mixed glial cultures by berberine. These findings are consistent with previous studies in which berberine inhibited amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ)- or AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-induced expression of these inflammatory factors in primary microglia or microglial cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Lu1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Jia1">[8]</xref>. Of the numerous neurotoxic factors released by activated glial cells, the consequences of upregulated iNOS, COX-2, cytokine and chemokine expression have been well established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Lucas1">[44]</xref>. Also, increased levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and MCP-1 have been demonstrated in the brain or CSF of brain injured patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Singhal1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Helmy1">[47]</xref>. Along with the fact that berberine attenuated neuronal cell death induced by microglial conditioned media, these observations suggest that berberine-mediated protection of damaged neurons was mediated by inhibition of these proinflammatory factors in the injured brain.</p>
<p>Our results demonstrated that berberine reduced the MMP-9 activity, neutrophil infiltration and ICAM-1 expression but did not affect claudin-5 or ZO-1 expression. This reduction in inflammation was associated with a decrease in TBI-induced BBB disruption and edema formation. MMP-9 functions to degrade the extracellular matrix, including major components of the basal lamina, causing BBB disruption after TBI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Nag1">[27]</xref>. In addition, excessive accumulation of neutrophils causes the release of inflammatory mediators <italic>and</italic> reactive oxygen species, leading to BBB disruption and edema <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Das1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Liao1">[48]</xref>. Upregulation of ICAM-1 may further contribute to the intravascular collection of peripheral neutrophils. Our results suggest that the protective effect of berberine on BBB may be attributed to the reduction of MMP-9 activity, neutrophil infiltration and ICAM-1 expression in the injured brain. However, recent research found that berberine could inhibit the proliferation and activation of T cells in animal models of cerebral ischemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Song1">[11]</xref> and autoimmune neuritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Li2">[49]</xref>. Also, berberine decreased lipopolysaccharide-induced proinflammatory responses in cultured murine neutrophils via activating AMPK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Zhao1">[50]</xref>. TBI causes a systemic inflammatory response including increased plasma levels of inflammatory mediators and circulating neutrophil counts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Liao1">[48]</xref>, both of which contribute to TBI-induced brain damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Das1">[37]</xref>. Therefore, it would be important in future studies to explore the peripheral effect by which berberine protects against TBI.</p>
<p>We further investigated the effects of berberine on the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway, which participates in the cerebral inflammation in TBI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Chen2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Ahmad1">[34]</xref>. The TLR4 signaling pathway is mediated by MyD88, which activates NF-κB, resulting in the upregulation of many pro-inflammatory genes (e.g., cytokines, chemokines, COX-2, and iNOS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Downes1">[51]</xref>. These proinflammatory mediators can then further activate NF-κB, forming a positive feedback loop to amplify inflammatory signals. In the present study, berberine attenuated TLR4 and MyD88 protein expression as well as nuclear NF-κB; it also abrogated the CCI-induced increase in inflammatory mediators, including COX-2, iNOS, IL-6, and MIP-2. Our results are in accordance with a recent study demonstrating that berberine reduced lipopolysaccharide-induced intestinal injury by suppressing the activation of TLR4 and NF-κB in the ileum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Li1">[10]</xref>. However, our data do not clarify the mechanism by which inhibiting glial activation attenuated neuronal apoptosis. One possibility is that berberine may suppress extrinsic apoptosis via inhibiting TLR4 signaling as MyD88 can bind Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) to trigger apoptosis via caspase-8 activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Ma1">[52]</xref>. Further investigations are needed to clarify the mechanisms by which berberine modulates inflammation to influence neuronal apoptosis.</p>
<p>W chose the route of intraperitoneal administration based on previous two neuroprotective studies in experimenal cerebral ischemia which showed that intraperitoneal injection of berberine (5 mg/kg for 2 doses, 0.5 h and 13.5 h after surgery) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Song1">[11]</xref> and 10 mg/kg, immediately after surgery) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Zhang2">[14]</xref> protected against ischemic brain injury. To our knowledge, there have been no pharmacological studies directly investigating brain distribution of berberine following intraperitoneal injection. However, the brain level of berberine increased at about 0.2 h after intravenous administration and peaked at 2–4 h <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Wang2">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Wang3">[36]</xref>. Although we didn't demonstrate that berberine could penetrate through the BBB after systemic administration, previous studies, both by others and ourselves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Chen2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Baskaya1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Koshinaga1">[54]</xref>, have shown that cortical impact injury induced BBB disruption starting at 5min post-injury and continued through 7 days. This opening of the BBB helps the transfer of systemically-administered drugs into brain cells. A recent study further demonstrated that berberine remained relatively stable in the brain after oral administration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115694-Tan1">[55]</xref>. Further investigations will be required to establish the route of administration to facilitate clinical applications of berberine to human TBI patients.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our results show that post-injury administration of berberine protects against brain damage in a clinically relevant model of TBI. This neuroprotective effect is at least in part mediated by inhibition of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway in glial cells. Our findings emphasize the role of glial cells in the pathogenesis of TBI; by suppressing their proinflammatory response with anti-inflammatory agents, we may inhibit the neurotoxicity associated with this disease. Considering the extended therapeutic window of berberine and its long-lasting effects, together with the fact that it has been extensively used preclinically and clinically, our results suggest that berberine could be a potential therapeutic agent for TBI.</p>
