      <abstract>
        <p><italic>REDD1/redd1</italic> is a stress-response gene that is induced under various stressful conditions such as hypoxia, DNA damage, and energy stress. The increased REDD1 inhibits mTOR signaling and cell growth. Here we report an unexpected role of Redd1 in regulating dorsoventral patterning in zebrafish embryos and the underlying mechanisms. Zebrafish <italic>redd1</italic> mRNA is maternally deposited. Although it is ubiquitously detected in many adult tissues, its expression is highly tissue-specific and dynamic during early development. Hypoxia and heat shock strongly induce <italic>redd1</italic> expression in zebrafish embryos. Knockdown of Redd1 using two independent morpholinos results in dorsalized embryos and this effect can be rescued by injecting <italic>redd1</italic> mRNA. Forced expression of Redd1 ventralizes embryos. Co-expression of Redd1 with Wnt3a or a constitutively active form of β-catenin suggests that Redd1 alters dorsoventral patterning by antagonizing the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. These findings have unraveled a novel role of Redd1 in early development by antagonizing Wnt/β-catenin signaling.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, also known as the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, plays a pivotal role in embryogenesis and in adult tissue homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Logan1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Clevers2">[3]</xref>. Aberrant regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is also associated with many human diseases, such as cancer, osteoporosis, aging, and degenerative disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Clevers1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Moon1">[4]</xref>. The transcriptional co-activator β-catenin is a key regulation step in this pathway. In the absence of Wnt ligands, cytoplasmic β-catenin is phosphorylated by the “destruction complex” consisting of Axin, APC, CK1 and GSK3β, resulting in β-catenin recognition by β-Trcp and subsequent degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-MacDonald1">[5]</xref>. When Wnt ligands bind to the receptors Frizzled and co-receptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP5/6), the Axin complex is recruited to the receptors and β-catenin phosphorylation and degradation are inhibited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-MacDonald1">[5]</xref>. The stabilized β-catenin accumulates and translocates into the nucleus to form complexes with the transcription factors TCF/LEF and activates target gene expression.</p>
      <p>In vertebrates, Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays a crucial role in dorsal organizer formation in early embryogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Tao1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Kelly1">[8]</xref> and regulates anterior-posterior patterning at later stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Erter1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Lekven1">[10]</xref>. In zebrafish embryos, it has been reported that maternal and zygotic Wnt/β-catenin manifests different effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Langdon1">[11]</xref>. Maternal β-catenin localizes to the nucleus of dorsal marginal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Schneider1">[12]</xref> and establishes dorsal cell fates before gastrulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Bellipanni1">[13]</xref>. Zygotic Wnt/β-catenin signaling in ventrolateral regions is required to initiate ventral cell fates after gastrulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Baker1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Ramel1">[15]</xref>. The nuclear localization of maternal β-catenin in the dorsal marginal cells leads to the expression of genes required for dorsal organizer formation, such as <italic>bozozok (boz)</italic>, <italic>chordin (chd)</italic>, and <italic>goosecoid (gsc)</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Yamanaka1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Stachel1">[18]</xref>. Loss of maternal β-catenin inhibits dorsal organizer formation. <italic>Ichabod</italic> mutants, in which maternal β-catenin 2 is absent, fail to form a normal embryonic shield <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Kelly1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Bellipanni1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>REDD1</italic> (<italic>Regulated in Development and DNA damage responses 1</italic>), also known as <italic>RTP801/DDIT4/Dig2</italic>, is a stress-response gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Ellisen1">[19]</xref>. It was initially identified as a transcriptional target of p53 following DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Ellisen2">[20]</xref>. Subsequent studies suggest that it is also a hypoxia-inducible gene and regulated by HIF-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Brugarolas1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-DeYoung1">[22]</xref>. In addition to DNA damage and hypoxia, <italic>REDD1</italic> is up-regulated in response to energy stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Sofer1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Schneider2">[24]</xref>, food deprivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-McGhee1">[25]</xref>, glucocorticoid treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Wang1">[26]</xref>, ER stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Whitney1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Jin1">[28]</xref>, and high cell density <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Jin2">[29]</xref>. The increased REDD1 inhibits mTOR signaling through the TSC1/TSC2 tumor-suppressor complex and inhibits cell growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-DeYoung1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Sofer1">[23]</xref>. <italic>REDD1</italic> knockout mice are more tolerant to cigarette smoke-induced lung injury and emphysema, partly <italic>via</italic> increased mTOR signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Yoshida1">[30]</xref>. Scylla and Charybdis, two homologs of REDD1 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, are also hypoxia induced. Flies that have lost both genes are more susceptible to hypoxia and mild overgrowth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Reiling1">[31]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The goal of this study was to characterize the <italic>redd1</italic> gene, examine its expression and physiological regulation, and study its role in stress response <italic>in vivo</italic> using zebrafish as an experimental model. We found that zebrafish <italic>redd1</italic> is maternally deposited and has a highly tissue-specific and dynamic expression pattern in early embryogenesis. Loss- and gain-of-function studies suggest that Redd1 has a previously unrecognized role in regulating dorsoventral patterning by antagonizing Wnt/β-catenin signaling in zebrafish embryos.</p>

        <title>Zebrafish <italic>redd1</italic> Encodes a Conserved Protein and is Expressed in Many Tissues</title>
        <p>By searching public databases and performing 5′- and 3′- rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) experiments, we identified and cloned zebrafish <italic>redd1</italic> gene (GenBank accession number: HM114348). Like mammalian and amphibian REDD1, zebrafish Redd1 has a predicted RTP801_C domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052674-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) and this domain shares a sequence identity of 61%, 60% and 61% to that of human, mouse, and frog, respectively. There is a conserved 14-3-3 binding site in the middle region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052674-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Recent studies in human REDD1 revealed that REDD1 undergoes GSK3β-dependent phosphorylation through Thr23 and Thr25, and this leads to its degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Katiyar1">[32]</xref>. These two residues are conserved in zebrafish Redd1 at positions 18 and 20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052674-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). These structural features suggest that this is indeed a bona fide Redd1. This conclusion is further supported by phylogenetic, genome structure, and synteny analyses, showing that zebrafish <italic>redd1</italic> is a human <italic>REDD1</italic> ortholog (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0052674.s001">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>

        <p>In the adult stage, <italic>redd1</italic> mRNA was detected by RT-PCR in all tissues examined, albeit at lower levels in gills (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052674-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>).

At 24 hpf and thereafter, <italic>redd1</italic> mRNA was expressed mainly in the neural ectoderm, somites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052674-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>, panel h), common cardinal vein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052674-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>, panels i and j), and the gill arches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052674-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>, panel k). These results indicate that <italic>redd1</italic> mRNA is maternally deposited.

        <title>Zebrafish <italic>redd1</italic> is Up-regulated Under Multiple Stressors</title>
        <p>The effects of hypoxia, heat shock, and food deprivation on the expression of <italic>redd1</italic> were studied by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Embryos of 6, 24, 36 and 48 hours post fertilization (hpf) were subjected to physical hypoxia treatment for 24 hours. In all these stages, <italic>redd1</italic> mRNA levels were up-regulated under hypoxic conditions. The <italic>redd1</italic> mRNA levels increased to nearly five folds (P&lt;0.05) at 30 hpf, ten folds (P&lt;0.001) at 48 hpf, and remained elevated at 60 and 72 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052674-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). The <italic>redd1</italic> mRNA levels were also increased to approximately three folds (P&lt;0.05) at 36 hpf, and five folds at 60 hpf (P&lt;0.01) by heat shock treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052674-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). We also studied the effect of food deprivation in juvenile and adult fish. The expression levels of <italic>redd1</italic> were significantly increased (P&lt;0.05) when fasted for one week, and reached their zenith (P&lt;0.001) when fasted for two weeks. The expression then decreased to the control group levels in week three and week four (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052674-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), suggesting this is a stress response. Similar induction of <italic>redd1</italic> expression by food deprivation was seen in one-year old adult fish (data not shown).

        <p>As mentioned above, the <italic>redd1</italic> transcript is maternally deposited and is expressed in a dynamic and tissue-specific manner in early development. To investigate the possible role of endogenous <italic>redd1</italic> in embryonic development, morpholino-mediated knockdown of <italic>redd1</italic> was carried out.

Approximately 70–80% of embryos injected with <italic>redd1</italic> MOs exhibited mild dorsalized phenotypes, <italic>i.e</italic>., a protruding tailbud that does not extend around the yolk as far as in the wild type, but lies in a more vegetal position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052674-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>).

Embryos in the C1 group exhibited partial loss of the caudal ventral fin, a bent tail, and shortened yolk sac extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052674-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, arrows). The majority of dorsalized embryos after MO1 or MO2 injection belonged to this group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052674-g003">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0052674.s003">Fig. S3</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we have shown that zebrafish <italic>redd1</italic> is a syntenic gene of human REDD1. Sequence comparison suggests that Redd1 is structurally conserved. Taking advantage of the zebrafish model, we have mapped the spatial and temporal expression pattern of <italic>redd1</italic> during early development and made several new findings. First, zebrafish <italic>redd1</italic> is a maternal gene. Both RT-PCR and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization can easily detect <italic>redd1</italic> mRNA in fertilized eggs. Second, zebrafish <italic>redd1</italic> mRNA is expressed throughout early development. Intriguingly, its expression in early embryos is highly tissue-specific. Zebrafish <italic>redd1</italic> mRNA is highly expressed in the germ ring at the shield stage. Later on, it is abundantly expressed in the prechordal plate/mesoderm, tail bud, and the neural ectoderm. At 24 hpf and thereafter, <italic>redd1</italic> mRNA was expressed mainly in the neural ectoderm, somites, cardinal vein, and the gill arches. This tissue-specific expression pattern in zebrafish embryos is consistent with what have been reported in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and rodents. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> REDD1/Redd1 homologs, <italic>scylla</italic> and <italic>charybde</italic>, are abundantly expressed in the dorsal domain during gastrulation and later in the central nervous system and cardiac precursor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Scuderi1">[41]</xref>. In developing mouse embryos, <italic>REDD1</italic> is expressed in the apical ectodermal ridge, a cluster of primitive ectoderm that is critical for induction of limb development; in ectodermally derived tissues such as the whisker pad and eyelid; as well as the developing cartilage of the limbs, tail, and cranium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Ellisen2">[20]</xref>. In adult zebrafish, <italic>redd1</italic> mRNA was detectable in all adult tissues examined, although its level in the gill was lower. The ubiquitous expression pattern fits its function as a stress-response gene. In human and mice, <italic>REDD1</italic> is ubiquitously expressed at low levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Shoshani1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Miyazaki1">[43]</xref>. These results suggest that the temporal and spatial expression of <italic>REDD1</italic>/<italic>redd1</italic> is more dynamic than previously thought. Although it is ubiquitously expressed in many adult tissues, its expression during early development is highly tissue-specific and dynamic.</p>
      <p>Mammalian <italic>REDD1</italic> has been shown to be induced by hypoxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Brugarolas1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-DeYoung1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Shoshani1">[42]</xref>, energy stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Sofer1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Schneider2">[24]</xref>, and food deprivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-McGhee1">[25]</xref>. When rats were subjected to food deprivation for 18 hours, both <italic>Redd1</italic> mRNA and protein levels increase dramatically. A subsequent 45 min re-feeding reduced them back to the baseline levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-McGhee1">[25]</xref>. In zebrafish, <italic>redd1</italic> mRNA was also up-regulated by food deprivation. Furthermore, we found that <italic>redd1</italic> is strongly induced in early embryos by hypoxia and heat shock, suggesting a possible role of <italic>redd1</italic> as a stress-response gene during embryogenesis. Indeed, our loss-of-function and gain-of-function analyses suggest that Redd1 plays a critical role in regulating dorsoventral patterning in zebrafish. <italic>Redd1</italic> morphants had a protruding tailbud and a loss of the caudal ventral fin, which are seen in dorsalized zebrafish mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Mullins1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Myers1">[45]</xref>. Molecular analysis using various dorsal and ventral marker genes revealed an expansion of expression domains of the dorsal marker genes <italic>chd</italic> and <italic>gsc</italic> and a reduction in ventral marker genes such as <italic>eve1</italic> and <italic>ved</italic>. Moreover, forced expression of Redd1 caused a reduction in dorsoanterior structures and an expansion of ventroposterior structures.</p>
      <p>How does a stress-response gene in the mTOR signaling pathway regulate dorsoventral patterning in embryogenesis? In this study, we provided several lines of evidence supporting the notion that Redd1 regulates dorsoventral patterning by antagonizing Wnt/β-catenin signaling. We showed that co-expression of Redd1 and Wnt3a in zebrafish embryos significantly inhibited Wnt3a activity. Likewise, Redd1 expression inhibited the β-catenin ΔN-induced dorsalizing effect <italic>in vivo</italic> and its activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. Importantly, <italic>redd1</italic> knockdown significantly increased and Redd1 overexpress reduced the expression of <italic>boz</italic>, a target gene of maternal β-catenin. These results strongly argue that Redd1 antagonizes maternal β-catenin signals. Recently, it was shown that CHOP (GADD153), which belongs to the same protein family as Redd1, binds to TCFs, thereby inhibiting Wnt/TCF activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Horndasch1">[46]</xref>. Whether Redd1 inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling using a similar mechanism needs further investigation. The fact that Redd1 antagonizes Wnt/β-catenin signaling, however is in agreement with the expression patterns of these genes. In early zebrafish embryos, <italic>redd1</italic> is mainly expressed at the germ ring, prechordal mesoderm, tail bud, and anterior neuroectoderm. These expression sites are similar to those of <italic>wnt8</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Kelly2">[47]</xref>, <italic>β-catenin</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Bellipanni1">[13]</xref>, and <italic>tcf3</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Pelegri1">[48]</xref>, . Therefore, <italic>redd1</italic> has overlapping expression domains with the major components of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, suggesting that they may interact with each other <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our study in zebrafish suggests that the stress-response gene <italic>redd1</italic> has a previously unrecognized developmental role. Redd1 regulates dorsoventral patterning by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling. These findings add new knowledge on the regulation of dorsoventral patterning in early development. Recent studies have suggested that mammalian REDD1 regulates cell growth <italic>via</italic> the mTOR signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Brugarolas1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Schneider2">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-McGhee1">[25]</xref>. Interestingly, Wnt can activate mTOR signals through GSK3 phosphorylation of TSC2, although this activation does not involve β-catenin-dependent transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Inoki1">[50]</xref>. Thus, Wnt signals may regulate transcription through β-catenin as well as translation through mTOR <italic>via</italic> two different signaling branches downstream of GSK3. Since <italic>REDD1</italic>/<italic>redd1</italic> is induced by DNA damage, hypoxia, and starvation and because it both down regulates mTOR signaling and antagonizes Wnt/β-catenin signaling, it may act as a key player in these processes under different conditions. Aberrant regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling is associated with many human diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-Clevers2">[3]</xref>. Mutations that result in up-regulation of nuclear β-catenin levels are often linked to increased tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-MacDonald1">[5]</xref>. Similarly, down-regulation of REDD1 expression was observed in a number of human cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052674-DeYoung1">[22]</xref>. It will be of interest to investigate β-catenin signaling in those tumor tissues and determine its relationship to reduced REDD1 activity.</p>
