However, this discrepancy may not be real, but rather appear because of the violation of implicit assumptions in the estimation procedures, such as non-gradual change of evolutionary rate and failure to correct for convergent evolution.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>New procedures for divergence-time estimation robust to abrupt changes in the rate of molecular evolution are described. We used a variant of the multidimensional vector space (MVS) procedure to take account of possible convergent evolution. Numerical simulations of abrupt rate change and convergent evolution showed good performance of the new procedures in contrast to current methods. Application to complete mitochondrial genomes identified marked rate accelerations and decelerations, which are not obtained with current methods. The root of placental mammals is estimated to be ∼18 million years more recent than when assuming a log Brownian motion model. Correcting the pairwise distances for convergent evolution using MVS lowers the age of the root about another 20 million years compared to using standard maximum likelihood tree branch lengths. These two procedures combined revise the root time of placental mammals from around 122 million years ago to close to 84 million years ago. As a result, the estimated distribution of molecular divergence times is broadly consistent with quantitative analysis of the North American fossil record and traditional morphological views.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>By including the dual effects of abrupt rate change and directly accounting for convergent evolution at the molecular level, these estimates provide congruence between the molecular results, paleontological analyses and morphological expectations.

The root of living placental mammals has been reported to be in the range of 100–140 mya <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Waddell2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Archibald1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Springer2">[15]</xref> even with application of rate-adjustment techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Waddell2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Springer2">[15]</xref>. The molecular consensus of an old root is becoming strong enough that it may become dogma without a close examination of the assumptions being made in such analyses. The true age of the orders and superorders has important implications for determining the overall paleoecology and biogeography of placental mammals during a period that included the breakup of continents and the extinction of terrestrial dinosaurs. Reconciling the different paleontological and molecular divergence time estimates has important implications for basic methodologies that are central to evolutionary study.</p><p>The strength of molecular divergence time studies is their potential to draw information from very long aligned sequences of many species. It is widely assumed that a huge amount of sequence data and the approximate rate constancy of sequence evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Kimura1">[16]</xref> make molecular estimates more reliable than those based solely on fossil data. Such analyses on a genomic scale are generally anticipated to be decisive because they are expected to be free of stochastic noise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Sanderson1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Sanderson2">[18]</xref>.</p><p>However, molecular studies acknowledge the problem of misspecification of the model of sequence change, which may result in seriously biased estimation. The relationships among placental orders do vary according to the data used and the taxa sampled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Stanhope1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Arnason1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Waddell3">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Springer2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Horai1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Nikaido1">[22]</xref>. Most methods of phylogenetic inference rely strongly on probabilistic models of sequence evolution, and neither directly detect nor correct for convergent evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Zhang1">[23]</xref>. When left uncorrected, such “homoplasy” may attract lineages and underestimate certain pairwise distances. This in turn distorts branch (edge) length estimates, which are of primary importance for divergence time estimation. While some methods will detect potential convergent evolution, for example Hadamard conjugations and SplitsTree <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Swofford1">[24]</xref>, Kitazoe et al. have developed multidimensional vector space (MVS) representation methods to both detect convergent evolution among estimated distances and to also correct for this bias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Kitazoe1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Okabayashi1">[27]</xref>.</p><p>A further problem facing molecular dating is the evolutionary rate constancy, or lack of constancy, over long periods. Since its proposal in 1965 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Zuckerkandl1">[28]</xref>, the molecular clock hypothesis has been one of the most hotly debated subjects in evolutionary biology. It is now widely accepted that a molecular clock tends to hold well for closely related organisms, but breaks down with increasing evolutionary divergence. To adjust for the inevitable fluctuation of evolutionary rates, nonparametric <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Sanderson1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Sanderson2">[18]</xref>, local clock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Kishino1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Yoder1">[30]</xref>, and hierarchical Bayesian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Thorne1">[31]</xref> methods have been developed. These methods are robust against stochastic fluctuations of evolutionary rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Thorne1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Hedges1">[33]</xref>. However, they may cause serious problems when pronounced transient changes of rate occur, because they overly smooth such rate changes. In this article, we show the magnitude of such problems using clear worked examples.</p><p>To improve the detection of, and robustness to, abrupt rate changes, we have developed a new procedure that minimizes the local variability of the inverse of the evolutionary rate. Just as the effective size of fluctuating populations is represented by the harmonic mean over time, the mean evolutionary rate among lineages is expressed better by the harmonic mean. This approach is especially useful when branch lengths measured in the expected number of substitutions per site (the products of rates and times) are estimated accurately, and there are either rapid transient changes of rate (hence large rate heterogeneity) or a general bias towards a speed up or slow down in rates through time.</p><p>Using this new procedure, an analysis of 69 mitochondrial protein sequences (3660 amino acid sites in total) from placental mammals identified a rapid acceleration of evolutionary rate for the lineage directly leading to the common ancestor of Supraprimates and an even more marked one for the lineage leading to Laurasiatheria. This acceleration was followed closely by a strong deceleration, which persisted in nearly all lineages of Laurasiatheria. In contrast, almost all lineages of Afrotheria and Xenarthra seem to have retained rates similar to that of the root. This view is in marked contrast to current rate-change penalty functions. The robustness of the new procedure is assessed using simulations that show the types of change that most concern biologists; speedups or slowdowns through time, transient rate changes, and rate changes that are do not follow a normal or transformed normal distribution, as well as stochastic variation. A revised estimate of the origin of placental mammals is as young as 84 mya, which is much more recent than current estimates using molecular data. The inferred age of deeper splits in the placental tree are compared with the rate of occurrence of new species from the North American fossil record. These two sources of data are far more congruent than is suggested by using current, possibly strongly misleading, dating methods.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Revised rates and times of mitochondrial protein sequences from placental mammals</title><p>Mitochondrial protein sequences are used widely in phylogenetic studies and have been particularly popular in studying placental mammals. A desirable feature of these data is relatively long sequences, good taxon sampling and very little missing data. Following alignment, we retained 3660 amino acid sites present in all of 62 placental mammals plus seven outgroup taxa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000384.s004">Table S1</xref> gives the accession numbers of protein sequences). In contrast, large nuclear protein datasets of mammals with diverse taxon sampling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Murphy1">[e.g.3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Waddell2">[4]</xref> show a large proportion of missing data. Such missing heterogeneous data may lead to complex systematic errors in distance estimation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Misawa1">[34]</xref>. This is particularly relevant since MVS analyses work best with low stochastic noise (hence relatively long sequences), diverse taxon sampling with a considerable proportion of taxa showing minimal convergent evolution, and minimal bias of the input distances from sources such as missing data.</p><p>We adopted a standard two-step procedure to estimate divergence times. The first step is to estimate the phylogenetic tree with unconstrained branch lengths in units of expected numbers of substitutions per site. Given the problems with convergent evolution in mitochondrial data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Waddell2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Springer1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Nikaido1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Kitazoe1">[25]</xref>, we used the MVS procedure to correct the input distances for convergent evolution. A variant of the core set approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Okabayashi1">[27]</xref> to MVS was used in this instance (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Fixing the topology to the tree obtained by MVS, which is very similar to trees obtained by previous authors using varied data sets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Waddell1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Springer1">[5]</xref>, branch lengths were reestimated using maximum likelihood (ML) in the program PAML <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Yang2">[35]</xref>. We used the JTT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Jones1">[36]</xref>+Gamma model with α = 0.5 for these analyses. The second step uses the tree and its branch lengths, some fossil constrained nodes, and a penalty or cost function to dampen rate changes, to infer divergence times of all nodes and evolutionary rates along all branches.</p><p>Three cost functions, F<sub>ADD</sub>, F<sub>LOG</sub>, and F<sub>IR</sub>, were applied to the MVS and ML trees. These functions penalize the fluctuation of rates, and do this on either a linear scale (here called the ADD function), on the log rate (LOG), or on the inverse rates (IR), respectively (see equations (1), (2), and (4) in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The tree estimated by MVS and F<sub>ADD </sub>is denoted MVS-F<sub>ADD</sub> and so on (while ML-F<sub>ADD</sub> indicates use of ML branch lengths).</p><p>To calibrate these trees, we used eight fossil constraints, all taken from previous studies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000384-g001">Figure 1 caption</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Waddell2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Springer2">[15]</xref>. The divergence times were estimated by then minimizing each cost function subject to these constraints (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The CI was calculated using a likelihood interpretation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) of the cost function residual analogous to the method used in Multidivtime <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Thorne1">[31]</xref>. This captures the error caused by deviations of the tree's branch lengths away from their expected values and includes the unpredictability of rate changes, which might mimic Brownian motion, for example. It will also incorporate variability arising from ancestral polymorphism. Polymorphism will cause fluctuations of the edge lengths of the tree when the analysis has multiple nodes constrained by fossil or other data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Waddell3">[c.f. 13]</xref>. Generally, the time at the most recent common ancestor of sequences from different species is older than the time at speciation. The extent of this difference varies among internal nodes due to both the stochastic nature of the coalescent and factors governing its expected magnitude, such as population size. The cost function does not take account of this bias, but the CI does include the variance arising from ancestral polymorphism at internal nodes.</p><fig id="pone-0000384-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000384.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Molecular divergence times and evolutionary rates of placental mammals.</title><p>A and B show the MVS-F<sub>IR</sub> and ML-F<sub>LOG</sub> trees, respectively.

It rests on the implicit expectation that any reasonable type of smoothing of changes in rate will give a similar answer. However, a simple linear form for the difference in rates is misleading, and this is illustrated by considering the general problem of estimating velocity (rate) given distance (in our case branch length). Going from point <italic>a</italic> to <italic>b</italic> at velocity <italic>v</italic><sub>1</sub>, then back at velocity <italic>v</italic><sub>2</sub>, the average velocity (<italic>v</italic><sub>av</sub>) is equal not to the standard arithmetic mean, but to the harmonic mean, 1/<italic>v</italic><sub>av</sub> = (1/<italic>v</italic><sub>1</sub>+1/<italic>v</italic><sub>2</sub>)/2. Further, going from point (node) <italic>a</italic> to <italic>b</italic> at velocity (rate) <italic>v</italic><sub>1</sub>, and from point <italic>b</italic> to <italic>c</italic> at velocity <italic>v</italic><sub>2</sub>, then the distances traveled (<italic>d<sub>ab</sub></italic> and <italic>d<sub>bc</sub></italic>) need no longer be equal so we must use weights. Specifically, <italic>v</italic><sub>av</sub> = (<italic>d<sub>ab</sub></italic>+<italic>d<sub>bc</sub></italic>)/(<italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub>+<italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub>), where <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> = <italic>d<sub>ab</sub></italic>/<italic>v</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> = <italic>d<sub>bc</sub></italic>/<italic>v</italic><sub>2</sub>. As a result, 1/<italic>v</italic><sub>av</sub> = (<italic>d<sub>ab</sub></italic>/<italic>v</italic><sub>1</sub>+<italic>d<sub>bc</sub></italic>/<italic>v</italic><sub>2</sub>)/(<italic>d<sub>ab</sub></italic>+<italic>d<sub>bc</sub></italic>). This is the same form as the average quantity <italic>A<sub>n</sub></italic> used to obtain <italic>F</italic><sub>IR</sub> (equation 4).

Here <bold><italic>B</italic></bold>, R, and <bold><italic>T</italic></bold> are the vectors of the estimated branch lengths, evolutionary rates, and divergence times, respectively, while <italic>F</italic> is the cost function. The value of <italic>λ</italic> expresses the weight for the penalty, and is called a hyperparameter.

When the sequences are long enough, for example concatenated mitochondrial protein sequences, it is often safe to assume that the branch lengths are estimated accurately, that is with minimal stochastic error (but not necessarily without systematic error, something we address in this paper using MVS). Accordingly, it is assumed that the products of rates and times are known exactly. Thus in a situation of long, or very long sequences (e.g. genomic alignments), the results returned by using just the penalty function will converge to those returned by either a Bayesian or a penalized likelihood approach with the same type of cost function.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>MVS core-set correction of biased evolutionary distances</title><p>In the MVS method, the additivity of evolutionary distances is converted using the expected orthogonality among branch vectors in a multidimensional Euclidean space <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Kitazoe1">[25]</xref>. If the estimated pairwise distances do not satisfy additivity, MVS provides an index to measure deviations from orthogonality without specifying a tree structure. This index enables one to diagnose whether a distance matrix is compatible with a tree and to modify the biased distances until they satisfy orthogonality, that is, with a zero value for the index. Here, a revised core-set approach, that is, an extension of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Okabayashi1">[27]</xref>, is applied to correct the observed pairwise distances for convergent evolution.</p><p>The first step of this approach is to divide the set of taxa into subgroups and to correct the distances between pairs in each subgroup. We decompose the taxa based on partitions with both strong biological support and high bootstrap support. The deviation from additivity of pairwise distances is much smaller within each subgroup than across the whole distance matrix. If an anomalously large deviation is observed associated with a single taxon within a subgroup, that taxon is removed temporarily from the analysis. When the only deviations between distances within a subset of taxa are judged to be due to stochastic noise, the pairwise distances are modified by solving the equation of motion (a method using a many body kinetic equation in physics), which uses the index of the deviation from additivity as the potential energy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Kitazoe1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Kitazoe2">[26]</xref>. The modified distance matrix within a subgroup is interpreted as the true additive distance matrix (core set) achieved by minimal modification of the original distances. Generally, the modified distances are very close to the distances estimated by the NJ method for just these taxa. Then, the excluded taxa are deposited into this core set tree by solving the equation of motion with the same potential function. Assuming that convergent evolution and long-branch attraction are the main source of deviation from additivity, we allow for only positive corrections of the biased distances between the core set and excluded taxa (that is, distances can only get bigger).</p><p>The second step is a clustering of subgroups. The pairwise distances between two core-set groups are corrected by assuming attractions between them (that is, some distances are underestimated) and by minimal enlargement of the distances between the two groups to satisfy additivity. In this way, the core-set approach used in this article is in the direction opposite to that used in an earlier procedure that proceeds from the whole tree down to subtrees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000384-Kitazoe2">[26]</xref>. This revised method seems more appropriate here because the branching pattern within subgroups becomes more apparent and there are smaller deviations from additivity.</p><p>Conceptually, the first step of MVS core set is to decompose the whole tree into putative monophyletic groups that show minimal bias internally. The approach developed as part of this particular study resembles <italic>k</italic>-means clustering, that is, minimizing the deviation (variance) within groups while maximizing the deviation (variance) between groups. At present, the decomposition is done in a supervised, as opposed to an automatic, manner. In the second step, and when it is difficult to connect two groups definitely, we first exclude taxa with the largest deviations from additivity and then complete a new core set for the remaining sequences. We then locate the excluded sequences on the core set tree using minimal modification of distances (a parsimony-like criterion) under the constraint of only enlarging the distances identified as being biased (thus the only biases are assumed to be due to attraction).</p><p>When analyzing the mitochondrial protein sequences, we estimated pairwise distances initially under the JTT+Gamma model with α = 0.5. Given moderately high bootstrap support, the placental tree was decomposed into four major groups: Laurasiatheria, Supraprimate, Xenarthra, and Afrotheria. Laurasiatheria was decomposed into five subgroups, namely Cetartiodactyla, Perissodactyla, Carnivora, Chiroptera, and Euliptotyphyla. Supraprimates was decomposed into two subgroups: Primates and Glires. The core-set analysis began by generating additive distances within these subgroups, after which the clustering procedure described above was applied to connect these subgroups. In this analysis, we analyzed sequences of Xenarthra and Afrotheria together in a single core-set. This is because a relatively short internal branch separates them and Xenarthra contains but a single sequence in this analysis. Finally, we tried to modify the distances between placental mammals and the outgroups, but we could not determine the position of the root with confidence because of very strong attractions between many placental mammals and the outgroups.
