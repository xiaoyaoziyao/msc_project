<title>Background</title>
<p>The treatment of patients with multiple trauma including blunt chest/thoracic trauma (TxT) and hemorrhagic shock (H) is still challenging. Numerous studies show detrimental consequences of TxT and HS resulting in strong inflammatory changes, organ injury and mortality. Additionally, the reperfusion (R) phase plays a key role in triggering inflammation and worsening outcome. Ethyl pyruvate (EP), a stable lipophilic ester, has anti-inflammatory properties. Here, the influence of EP on the inflammatory reaction and liver injury in a double hit model of TxT and H/R in rats was explored.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Female Lewis rats were subjected to TxT followed by hemorrhage/H (60 min, 35±3 mm Hg) and resuscitation/R (TxT+H/R). Reperfusion was performed by either Ringer`s lactated solution (RL) alone or RL supplemented with EP (50 mg/kg). Sham animals underwent all surgical procedures without TxT+H/R. After 2h, blood and liver tissue were collected for analyses, and survival was assessed after 24h.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Resuscitation with EP significantly improved haemoglobin levels and base excess recovery compared with controls after TxT+H/R, respectively (p&lt;0.05). TxT+H/R-induced significant increase in alanine aminotransferase levels and liver injury were attenuated by EP compared with controls (p&lt;0.05). Local inflammation as shown by increased gene expression of IL-6 and ICAM-1, enhanced ICAM-1 and HMGB1 protein expression and infiltration of the liver with neutrophils were also significantly attenuated by EP compared with controls after TxT+H/R (p&lt;0.05). EP significantly reduced TxT+H/R-induced p65 activation in liver tissue. Survival rates improved by EP from 50% to 70% after TxT+H/R.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec004">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>These data support the concept that the pronounced local pro-inflammatory response in the liver after blunt chest trauma and hemorrhagic shock is associated with NF-κB. In particular, the beneficial anti-inflammatory effects of ethyl pyruvate seem to be regulated by the HMGB1/NF-κB axis in the liver, thereby, restraining inflammatory responses and liver injury after double hit trauma in the rat.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Trauma is still the most common cause of death in children and young adults, as well as one of the global leading causes of worldwide mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref002">2</xref>]. The treatment of patients with severe and multiple traumatic injuries including blunt chest trauma and hemorrhagic shock is still challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref004">4</xref>]. Due to the microcirculatory disturbances and the release of pathogen-associated-molecular-patterns (PAMP) e.g. lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and/or damage-associated-molecular-patterns (DAMP) such as HMGB1 caused by tissue damage, notably these hypoxic conditions result in a massive activation of the immune system, which carries a high risk for multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and organ failure (e.g. lung, liver) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>The local inflammation in the liver during and after hypoxia induces a disturbed glycocalyx function with release of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, as well as the activation and immigration of monocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) into tissue leading to organ damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref016">16</xref>]. Subsequent capillary leakage amplifies tissue edema formation and both, tissue hypo-perfusion and hypo-oxygenation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref013">13</xref>]. Activation of NF-κB accompanies these pathophysiological processes, and further enhances the production and release of pro-inflammatory mediators including cytokines and HMGB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref019">19</xref>]. The therapeutic strategy with fluid resuscitation is indisputable, however, the required resuscitation after hemorrhagic shock may also trigger further inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref020">20</xref>] <italic>inter alia</italic> by the release of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, respectively (ROS and RNS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref021">21</xref>], underlining the importance of an adequate and organ-protective resuscitation strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Ethyl pyruvate (EP), the ester formed from ethanol linked to pyruvate, has exerted inflammation-suppressing characteristics in numerous <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref022">22</xref>]. In our own studies, EP reduced interleukin (IL)-8 release, adhesion of isolated neutrophils and CD54 expression in alveolar epithelial cells in an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of acute inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref023">23</xref>]. In an <italic>in vivo</italic> model of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysma, EP reduced the levels of serum myeloperoxidase, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and the damage of lung tissue compared to control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref024">24</xref>]. Also with regard to brain injuries, EP improved the neurological outcome by reducing inflammation <italic>via</italic> IL-1β and TNF-α, as well as microglia activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref025">25</xref>]. These findings were confirmed in hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury, where EP reduced alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and IL-6 as well as TNF-α levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref026">26</xref>]. Yang <italic>et al</italic>. (2016) provides a nice review about the anti-inflammatory and protective potential of EP in different models, including pancreas, liver, lung, kidney, heart and brain injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref027">27</xref>].</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been performed focussing on EP as a therapeutic reperfusion solution after trauma and concomitant massive blood loss. Therefore, based on above shown data, we examined the hypothesis that EP has a beneficial influence on local inflammatory response and liver injury in a clinically relevant double hit trauma model of blunt chest trauma and hemorrhagic shock.</p>

<p>All experiments and procedures were authorized by the responsible government authority ("Regierungspraesidium Darmstadt, Veterinaerswesen", Hessen, Germany; Nr. of the ethical approval.: FK/1028), and performed in compliance with the federal German law paying attention to the protection of animals, and Institutional Guidelines and the criteria in “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” (Eighth Edition The National Academies Press, 2011) were followed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref028">28</xref>]. In our study, we handled the animals permanently in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref029">29</xref>].

<title>Animals and experimental model</title>
<p>LEWIS rats (female, 190–240 g, Janvier Labs, France) were anaesthetised with isoflurane (1.2–3.0%). Buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg body weight) and a local anaesthesia (0.25% Carbostesin) were applied. The animals were shaved in the area of abdomen, chest, right inguinal and the neck. The right femoral artery was cannulated with polyethylene tubing for blood pressure measurement and blood removal for blood gas analyses (BGA). Subsequently, the bilateral lung contusion was carried out. Here, the animals were placed in supine position and a standardized pressure wave ruptured a Mylar polyester film (0.190 mm DuPont Teijin Films Luxembourg) fixed in a cylinder. The blast wave was directed to the thorax of the animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref031">31</xref>]. After a short stabilization phase, cannulation of the left jugular vein and the right carotid artery was performed. Then, hemorrhagic shock was initiated by taking stepwise blood <italic>via</italic> the carotid artery until a mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) of 35 ± 3 mm Hg was reached. This blood pressure was kept constant for 60 min using a blood pressure analyzer (Siemens AG), if necessary by further withdrawal or recirculation of withdrawn blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref032">32</xref>]. At the end of the hemorrhagic shock period reperfusion was carried out <italic>via</italic> the jugular vein. Depending on the group assignment, the reperfusion was performed by blood and Ringer’s lactated solution (RL), or blood and RL supplemented with EP. 60% of the withdrawn blood volume plus 50% RL or 50% RL plus EP (Sigma Aldrich, 50 mg/kg body weight) of the maximum removed volume were reperfused. After completion of a 30 minutes reperfusion period the catheters were removed, the wounds were closed and anesthesia was terminated. During the experimental period a continuous temperature monitoring was performed.</p>
<p>In one experimental arm, two hours after end of the experiment, sacrifice was performed. Under isoflurane anesthesia the abdominal aorta was punctured by a laparotomy and blood was withdrawn. Flushing was carried out <italic>via</italic> the <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cava</italic> using 20 ml RL. The left liver flap was removed and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Finally, rinsing by 20 ml of 10% buffered formalin solution and the removal of the right liver lobe followed. The right liver lobe was enclosed in paraffin and during the further procedure sectioned and stained with hematoxylin-eosin.</p>
<p>In the other experimental arm, survival was assessed after 24 hours.</p>

<p>Acclimation of the animals was ensured for at least 7 days. Experimentation was performed in the same building to keep the stress level of the animals as low as possible.</p>
<p>Anaesthesia was performed as above described. Buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg body weight) and a local anaesthesia (0.25% Carbostesin) were applied. The first application of Buprenorphine was conducted 30 min prior experimentation. Postoperative Buprenorphine was given twice daily until the end of experimentation. During the complete experimentation period a continuous monitoring of blood pressure and temperature was performed. The animals received free access to water and food postoperative. After the experimentation, their condition has been controlled, and euthanasia (of all animals, which were grouped to “died”) was performed in case they met the requirements in accordance with the guidelines of the Ethics Committee of the RP Darmstadt as described above. All involved group members hold the certificate of the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA).</p>

<p>To assess, if there were differences in blood volume to induce hemorrhagic shock that may affect the results, this was evaluated at first. The required maximal bleed out volume to induce and maintain hemorrhagic shock did not differ between both experimental groups with and without ethyl pyruvate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192171.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).

During shock there were no differences between the TxT+H/R_RL and TxT+H/R_EP group. At the beginning of the resuscitation period, the MABP recovered to comparable levels in both groups. However, in the later resuscitation phase the TxT+H/R_EP group achieved a significantly higher MABP compared to the TxT+H/R_RL group (TxT+H/R_RL: 66.14 ± 5.64 <italic>vs</italic>.

<p>The proposed mechanism that is involved on the hand in the beneficial impact of EP in inflammatory conditions as shown in other studies intrigues NF-κB.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we examined the effect of ethyl pyruvate as resuscitation solution in a double hit model of blunt chest trauma and hemorrhagic shock in rats. Pyruvate is the final product of glycolysis, a scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and has been tested in numerous <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref036">36</xref>]. Salahudeen <italic>et al</italic>. showed a beneficial effect of pyruvate regarding renal injury, Mongan <italic>et al</italic>. and Slovin <italic>et al</italic>. found an improved survival after sodium pyruvate infusions in models of hemorrhagic shock, and Sileri <italic>et al</italic>. investigated a protective effect of pyruvate on ischemia/reperfusion injury of the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref040">40</xref>]. The study situation regarding a direct comparison of EP and pyruvate is inconsistent. For example, Zeng <italic>et al</italic>. examined EP and pyruvate in neonatal rat cerebrocortical slices and has found a superiority of EP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref041">41</xref>]. On the other hand, Sharma <italic>et al</italic>. detected a advantage of sodium pyruvate compared with EP in a hemorrhagic shock model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref042">42</xref>]. Our decision to use EP as a reperfusion solution is mainly based on two important issues. First, pyruvate has a limited stability in solutions, so that in an aldol-like reaction parapyruvate can arise. Second, EP has been used as a safe substance in a Phase II trial in patients with cardiac surgery, although without a significant beneficial effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref043">43</xref>]. The reasons for the results of the Phase II trial remain unclear, but may certainly be caused by the applied dose of EP, selection of the study cohort or no adequate inflammatory response in this setting. However, we believe due to the encouraging <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> results regarding a potential therapy with EP, that further studies to investigate, understand and use the beneficial effects of EP are required.</p>
<p>Protective effects of ethyl pyruvate in rodents with myocardial ischemia/reperfusion, hemorrhagic or septic shock, or multiple organ injury have already been published before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref024">24</xref>]. However, the above discussed clinical trial has failed to confirm these effects of ethyl pyruvate in cardiopulmonary bypass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref043">43</xref>]. Importantly, models of isolated hemorrhage do not mimic the clinical settings of trauma, and no data are available for the clinically relevant trauma model consisting of blunt chest trauma and hemorrhagic shock. The data from this model show a decrease in haemoglobin, negative base excess values, as well as strong organ injury to the liver, and an increased local inflammatory response after trauma. Ethyl pyruvate as resuscitation solution improved the recovery of haemoglobin and base excess, and reduced the liver damage as shown by reduced ALT values and histopathological damage. Furthermore, ethyl pyruvate reduced the IL-6 and ICAM-1 gene expression which was accompanied with lower infiltration of PMNL into the liver, and furthermore attenuated the release of phosphorylated RelA/ NF-κB p65, as well, indicating at the underlying mechanism.</p>
<p>The effect of trauma and hemorrhagic shock on haemoglobin, oxygen saturation and base excess have been addressed by others before, showing that during the trauma/ hemorrhage phase a drop of haemoglobin and oxygen saturation occurred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref044">44</xref>], while the base excess developed negatively, also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref045">45</xref>]. Likewise, a recovery in the reperfusion phase is to be expected. Conflictive data have been shown indicating that ethyl pyruvate improved hemodynamics and organ function in porcine endotoxemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref046">46</xref>], as previously reported in rodents as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref047">47</xref>]. In contrast, Dong <italic>et al</italic>. and Mulier <italic>et al</italic>. have shown that ethyl pyruvate failed to improve hemodynamics in splenectomized or nonsplenectomized swine with hemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref018">18</xref>]. In our study, the recovery of base excess and haemoglobin in the resuscitation period and two hours later, was more pronounced in the ethyl pyruvate group compared to the control group after trauma/hemorrhage. The higher haemoglobin values in the ethyl pyruvate group compared to the control group also explain the difference with regard to the blood pressure between those two groups at the end of the resuscitation period. Considering that the base deficit is a known indicator for trauma severity, outcome and resuscitation success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref049">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref012">12</xref>], the better recovery in the ethyl pyruvate group underlines the beneficial potential of ethyl pyruvate as resuscitation fluid. Regarding the total protein content and tHb levels, the TxT+H/R_EP group exhibited higher protein values compared to the TxT+H/R_RL group and slightly lower values compared to the sham group (TxT+H/R_RL: 3.32 ± 0.28 g/dL <italic>vs</italic>. sham: 4.27 ± 0.17 g/dL and TxT+H/R_EP: 4.10 ± 0.27 g/dL, respectively, p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192171.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). However, the total protein content in the plasma was determined at two hours after resuscitation illustrating either the liver recovery or protection by EP during the reperfusion phase. This effect is shown, on the one hand, by the lower liver damage in the TxT+H/R_EP group that has been confirmed and represented in histological evaluation as well. In the TxT+H/R_RL group, we have seen significantly higher liver damage in the histological sections as well as increased ALT values, data suggesting an improved synthesis efficiency of the liver in the EP group as compared to the control after H/R. On the other hand, the small difference between the sham group and the TxT+H/R_EP group in terms of hemodilution is surprising as well as restoration of tHb at 2 hr post resuscitation. However, Yang <italic>et al</italic>. examined in his study the influence of EP on the liver in a setting of severe acute pancreatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref052">52</xref>]. His group found a significantly higher blood volume in the EP group, while the exact mechanism remained unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref052">52</xref>]. We did not measure the blood volume between the different groups. Certainly, the blood volume and the underlying mechanism remain to be evaluated in further studies as they may explain the differences in total protein content and restoration of tHb. Trauma severity was comparable in both groups as nicely shown by the comparable base excess values at the end of the hemorrhagic shock period (post H). In line with the improved compensatory mechanisms by applying resuscitation fluid supplemented with ethyl pyruvate after trauma/hemorrhage, mortality has shown a clear trend to a better survival by using this protocol, although the difference was not statistically significant. An increase in the number of animals per group was considered to elaborate a significant difference in terms of survival. However, performing only the survival study without significant molecular analyses was omitted due to ethical reasons and limited resources for only this setting. So, the question of the survival significance should be answered in further larger studies implying additional parameters. In general, then, based on current findings, the endpoints should be chosen more carefully. It may be wise to choose organ or inflammation parameters as primary endpoint, and additionally, if evaluating mortality, the necessary statistical power that may comprise much higher numbers of animals remains to be considered always regarding the ethical aspect as well.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, data regarding the immune modulating effect of pyruvate in a double hit model of blunt chest trauma and hemorrhagic shock are unavailable. However, in other <italic>in vivo</italic> settings, a positive effect of ethyl pyruvate has been shown with regard to the liver and the immune system. Tsung <italic>et al</italic>. exposed rats to 60 minutes of partial warm hepatic ischemia followed by reperfusion with ethyl pyruvate or ringer`s lactated solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref053">53</xref>]. The authors found a decrease of serum transaminase, of degree of hepatic necrosis and of neutrophil infiltration in the liver after treatment with ethyl pyruvate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref053">53</xref>]. Moreover, the expressions of hepatic ICAM-1 mRNA and inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6, were decreased in ethyl pyruvate treated animals compared with the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref053">53</xref>]. Yang <italic>et al</italic>. showed in alcohol-intoxicated mice that ethyl pyruvate alleviated the liver damage after abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref054">54</xref>]. <italic>Inter alia</italic> alanine aminotransferase, histopathological fatty change and necrosis were reduced by ethyl pyruvate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref054">54</xref>]. Furthermore, the successful use of ethyl pyruvate for the treatment of liver injury after severe acute pancreatitis has also been confirmed <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref055">55</xref>]. Also, this experimental design showed a reduction of alanine aminotransferase and histopathological damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref055">55</xref>]. In summary, our data clearly support these findings. With regard to liver damage, in our double hit model of blunt chest trauma combined with hemorrhagic shock, ethyl pyruvate attenuated the increase of alanine aminotransferase and the histopathological liver tissue damage. Moreover, we found in ethyl pyruvate treated animals less gene expression of pro-inflammatory IL-6 and ICAM, reduced levels in ICAM-1 protein expression, lower rates of infiltrating neutrophils into the liver, and less necrosis in the liver.</p>
<p>While the underlying pathomechanism has not been definitively clarified yet, a central role for NF-κB in the regulation of the immune response and apoptosis seems likely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref056">56</xref>]. Dong <italic>et al</italic>. have shown that ethyl pyruvate provided therapeutic anti-inflammatory benefits to modulate splenic NF-κB, restraining inflammatory responses and organ injury during resuscitation in lethal porcine hemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref018">18</xref>]. It has been reported further that ethyl pyruvate inhibited LPS-induced activation of p65 NF-κB in RAW macrophages cells, as well as DNA-binding of wild-type p65 NF-κB in HEK293 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref058">58</xref>]. According to these data, our study with blunt chest trauma and hemorrhagic shock induced a substantial increase in activation of RelA/ NF-κB p65. Resuscitation with ethyl pyruvate markedly inhibited RelA/ NF-κB p65 activation in the liver compared with the control group after trauma. This is in line with results of Tsung <italic>et al</italic>., who found an inhibition of NF-κB after warm hepatic ischemia and ethyl pyruvate treatment <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref053">53</xref>]. Recent studies suggest that ethyl pyruvate protects against coxsackie virus B3-induced acute viral myocarditis by suppression of HMGB1/RAGE/NF-κB pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref059">59</xref>]. Also with regard to hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury, it has been demonstrated that inhibition of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis and autophagy was mediated partly through downregulation of HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref026">26</xref>]. In our double hit model, blunt chest trauma and hemorrhagic shock induced HMGB1 up-regulation was markedly reduced by ethyl pyruvate. This is in line with the results of Luan <italic>et al</italic>., in his study EP was examined in view of the influence on liver damage in rats with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref055">55</xref>]. Similar to our results the increase of inflammatory cytokines, here TNF-α and IL-1β, and also HMGB1 after SAP were attenuated by EP. Regarding the underlying mechanism, Luan <italic>et al</italic>. found decreased NF-κB DNA-binding activity in EP treated animals compared to the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref055">55</xref>]. Also, <italic>in vivo</italic> in a setting of hepatic fibrosis in rats reduced ALT, AST, IL-6 and HMGB1 values were found after EP treatment compared to the control group accompanied by decreased mRNA levels of TLR4 and NF-κB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref060">60</xref>]. Furthermore, a protective effect of EP at alcohol-induced liver injury, hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury and autoimmune hepatitis has been shown, which has been associated with diminished activation of NF-κB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref061">61</xref>]. Consistent with those findings involving NF-κB, in the study of Shen <italic>et al</italic>. reduced expression of NF-κB in mRNA and protein level was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref061">61</xref>]. Han <italic>et al</italic>. explored <italic>in vitro</italic> the mechanism of EP and ruled out that the effect was caused by inhibition of IκB degradation or by DNA binding of the p50 subunit of NF-κB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref058">58</xref>]. Though, they showed that EP alters Cys<sup>65</sup> in p65 and thereby blocks the DNA binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref058">58</xref>]. Fink specified the mode of action and reasoned that efficacy of EP is caused by the “NF-kB-dependent signalling by interfering with binding of the transcription factor to cis-acting response elements in the promoter regions of target genes” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192171.ref022">22</xref>]. In summary, EP shows a multidisciplinary protective effect on the liver, which may be linked to the inhibition of NF-kB DNA binding, and to the best of our knowledge, there are no further studies in a combination model of blunt chest trauma and hemorrhagic shock regarding EP.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our current data suggest that the pronounced local pro-inflammatory response in the liver after blunt chest trauma and hemorrhagic shock is mediated <italic>via</italic> NF-κB. Furthermore, ethyl pyruvate, as a non-toxic compound, can provide therapeutic anti-inflammatory benefits by regulating the liver HMGB1/NF-κB axis, thereby, restraining inflammatory responses, and organ injury after double hit trauma in rats.</p>
