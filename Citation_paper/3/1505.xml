<abstract>
<p>Galanthamine is an Amaryllidaceae alkaloid used to treat the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. This compound is primarily isolated from daffodil <italic>(Narcissus</italic> spp.<italic>)</italic>, snowdrop (<italic>Galanthus</italic> spp.), and summer snowflake (<italic>Leucojum aestivum)</italic>. Despite its importance as a medicine, no genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of galanthamine have been identified. This absence of genetic information on biosynthetic pathways is a limiting factor in the development of synthetic biology platforms for many important botanical medicines. The paucity of information is largely due to the limitations of traditional methods for finding biochemical pathway enzymes and genes in non-model organisms. A new bioinformatic approach using several recent technological improvements was applied to search for genes in the proposed galanthamine biosynthetic pathway, first targeting methyltransferases due to strong signature amino acid sequences in the proteins. Using Illumina sequencing, a <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assembly was constructed for daffodil. BLAST was used to identify sequences that contain signatures for plant <italic>O</italic>-methyltransferases in this transcriptome. The program HAYSTACK was then used to identify methyltransferases that fit a model for galanthamine biosynthesis in leaf, bulb and inflorescence tissues. One candidate gene for the methylation of norbelladine to 4′-<italic>O</italic>-methylnorbelladine in the proposed galanthamine biosynthetic pathway was identified. This methyltransferase cDNA was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and the protein purified by affinity chromatography. The resulting protein was found to be a norbelladine 4′-<italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase (<italic>Np</italic>N4OMT) of the proposed galanthamine biosynthetic pathway.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Amaryllidaceae alkaloids are a group of alkaloids with many documented biological activities. This makes them valuable potential medicines several examples are the anti-cancer compounds hemanthamine and lycorine and the anti-viral compound pancratistatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Gabrielsen1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Liu1">[3]</xref>. One example of an Amaryllidaceae alkaloid already used medically to treat Alzheimer’s disease is galanthamine. Galanthamine is an alkaloid discovered in 1953 that is produced by members of the Amaryllidaceae family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Uyeo1">[4]</xref>. It reduces the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease through acetylcholine esterase inhibition and nicotinic receptor binding. These activities are thought to compensate for reduced acetylcholine sensitivity in Alzheimer’s disease by increasing acetylcholine levels and perhaps increasing acetylcholine sensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Barik1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Irwin1">[6]</xref>. Until now, no committed biosynthetic genes have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Wilcock1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Wilcock2">[8]</xref>. Limited enzyme kinetic characterization has been done on plant protein extracts enriched for the norbelladine 4′-<italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase (N4OMT) of <italic>Nerine bowdenii</italic>, but the underlying gene was never identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Mann1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>The putative galanthamine biosynthetic pathway has been studied in detail and intermediates in the pathway have been determined. This knowledge is based on radiolabeling experiments. Work on other Amaryllidaceae alkaloids including lycorine and hemanthamine studying steps prior to 4′-<italic>O</italic>-methylnorbelladine can be applied to galanthamine biosynthesis because 4′-<italic>O</italic>-methylnorbelladine is a universal substrate for these alkaloids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Ejchhorn1">[10]</xref>. The proposed pathway starts with the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Barton1">[11]</xref>. In <italic>Narcissus incomparabilis</italic> phenylalanine was established as a precursor that contributes the catechol portion of norbelladine. This was done using radiolabeling experiments to trace incorporation of [3-<sup>14</sup>C]phenylalanine into lycorine and degradation experiments on the resulting lycorine to determine the location of the <sup>14</sup>C label <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Suhadolnik1">[12]</xref>. Similar experiments with phenylalanine were performed in <italic>Nerine browdenii</italic> monitoring hemanthamine incorporation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Wildman1">[13]</xref>. As a follow up radiolabeling experiments were used to determine that phenylalanine probably proceeds sequentially through the intermediates <italic>trans</italic>-cinnamic acid, <italic>p</italic>-hydroxycinnamic acid and 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid or <italic>p</italic>-hydroxybenzaldehyde before conversion into 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Suhadolnik2">[14]</xref>. Tyrosine has been established as a precursor of galanthamine that in contrast to phenylalanine contributes only to the non-catechol half of the norbelladine intermediate. This was done by observing [2-<sup>14</sup>C]tyrosine incorporation into galanthamine and degradation experiments of galanthamine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Barton1">[11]</xref>. Tyrosine decarboxylase converts tyrosine into tyramine and is well characterized in other plant families <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Lehmann1">[15]</xref>. 3,4-Dihydroxybenzaldehyde and tyramine condense into a Schiff-base and are reduced to form the first alkaloid in the proposed pathway, norbelladine. Norbelladine has been documented to incorporate into galanthamine and all major Amaryllidaceae alkaloid types in <sup>14</sup>C radiolabeling studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Barton1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Battersby1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Barton2">[18]</xref>. 4′-<italic>O</italic>-methylnorbelladine is then formed by <italic>O</italic>-methylation of norbelladine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Barton1">[11]</xref>. A phenol-coupling reaction, followed by spontaneous oxide bridge formation, creates <italic>N</italic>-demethylnarwedine, which is then reduced and <italic>N</italic>-methylated to yield galanthamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103223-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Ejchhorn1">[10]</xref>. In one study, Barton et al. fed <italic>O</italic>-methyl[1-<sup>14</sup>C]norbelladine to flower stalks of King Alfred daffodils, but it was not incorporated into galanthamine. The authors concluded that the intermediate in the pathway must be 4′-<italic>O</italic>-methyl-<italic>N</italic>-methylnorbelladine despite low incorporation of this compound when the equivalent experiment was conducted with 4′-O-methyl-[N-methyl-<sup>14</sup>C]norbelladine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Barton1">[11]</xref>. A recent revision of the proposed pathway by Eichhorn et al. contradicted this conclusion and placed the <italic>N</italic>-methylation step at the end of the proposed pathway instead of before the phenol-coupling reaction. In that study, [OC<sup>3</sup>H<sub>3</sub>]4′-<italic>O</italic>-methylnorbelladine was applied to ovary walls of <italic>Leucojum aestivum.</italic> Incorporation into products indicated that the pathway produced <italic>N</italic>-demethylated intermediates up until the penultimate step to galanthamine. <italic>N</italic>-methylation was proposed as the final step of biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Ejchhorn1">[10]</xref>.</p>

<p>The discovery of genes involved in metabolism is essential to metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. The elucidation of plant biochemical pathways can take decades. In fact, the biosynthesis of morphine, an important opiate analgesic, is still not completely elucidated at the gene level, even though the first enzyme specific to morphine biosynthesis was discovered more than 20 years ago in 1993 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Gerardy1">[19]</xref>. Reports on the enzymatic activities of poppy extracts to describe the morphine biosynthetic pathway go even farther back to 1971 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Roberts1">[20]</xref>. After more than 40 years of enzymology and reverse genetics, the morphine biosynthetic pathway is still incomplete at the gene level. Traditionally, plant biochemical pathway enzymes have been identified either directly by purification from plant extracts or indirectly by examining enriched cDNA libraries and functionally expressing clones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Mann1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Raman1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Widiez1">[27]</xref>. To reduce pathway discovery from a 20+ year process to a more reasonable time frame, new methods must be developed and embraced. The previous work on galanthamine biosynthesis makes the prediction of enzyme classes involved in the proposed pathway possible, thereby rendering the galanthamine pathway a suitable system for development of an omic methodology for biochemical pathway discovery.</p>
<p>In this study, using galanthamine biosynthesis as proof-of-concept, a novel workflow is presented to streamline the identification of biosynthetic pathway genes. A <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome is created for <italic>Narcissus</italic> sp. <italic>aff. pseudonarcissus</italic> using illumina sequencing. HAYSTACK, a program that utilizes the Pearson correlation, is used to find genes that co-express with galanthamine accumulation in this transcriptome. This set of candidates is interrogated for homologs to methyltransferases. An OMT that converts norbelladine to 4′-<italic>O</italic>-methylnorbelladine (<italic>Np</italic>N4OMT) in the proposed biosynthesis of galanthamine is identified in this manner and characterized.</p>

<title>Alkaloid extraction and quantification</title>
<p>Daffodil leaf, bulb and inflorescence tissues were extracted by grinding tissue with a mortar and pestle cooled with liquid nitrogen. Each ground sample was split into three technical replicates. Two volumes of 70% ethanol were added followed by vortexing 5 min and centrifuging at 14,000×g for 10 min. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.2 µm low protein binding hydrophilic LCR (PTFE, millex-LG) membrane. For galanthamine quantitation, samples were diluted 1000 fold. Liquid chromatography samples were injected (10 µl) onto an LC-20AD (Shimadzu) with a Waters Nova Pak C-18 (300×3.9 mm 4 µm) column coupled to a 4000 QTRAP (AB Sciex Instruments) for MS/MS analysis. The gradient program had a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min; solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in H<sub>2</sub>O and solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. At the beginning of the program, solvent B was held at 15% for 2 min, followed by a linear gradient to 43% B at 15 min, 90% B at 15.1 min, 90% B at 20 min, 15% B at 21 min and 15% B at 26 min. A Turbo Ion Spray ionization source temperature of 500°C was used with low resolution for Q1 and Q3. All multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) scans were performed in positive ion mode. The ion fragment used for quantitation of galanthamine was 288.00 [M+H]<sup>+</sup>/213.00 [M-OH-C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>N]<sup>+•</sup> <italic>m/z</italic>. Galanthamine was identified by comparison of retention time and fragmentation pattern to authentic galanthamine standard. The Analyst 1.5 software was used to quantitate galanthamine using a comparison of peak area of the unknown to authentic galanthamine.</p>

<title>Illumina sequencing and transcriptome assembly</title>
<p>The transcriptome was generated via data cleaning, short read assembly, final assembly, and post processing steps. A modified TRIzol RNA isolation method found as protocol number 13 in Johnson et al. was used to obtain RNA for cDNA library preparation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Johnson1">[28]</xref>. Illumina RNA-Seq was used to generate 100 base pair paired-end reads from the cDNA library. The resulting data was monitored for overrepresented reads. Having found no such reads, adaptor sequences and sections of the standard phi X genome were identified and removed. Reads were then trimmed for quality using the FASTX toolkit version 0.0.8 with a Q value cutoff of 10 as is default for PHRAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-FASTXToolkit1">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>Reads were assembled in the following manner. ABySS was used to run multiple assemblies of the reads with a range of kmers 24≤k≤54. The resulting assemblies were assembled into scaffolds using ABySS scaffolder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Birol1">[30]</xref>. Gaps in the sequences were resolved using GapCloser from the SOAPdenovo suit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Luo1">[31]</xref>. A final assembly was conducted on the resulting synthetic ESTs using Mira in EST assembly mode <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Chevreux1">[32]</xref>. All sequences with over 98% identity were considered redundant and removed using CD-Hit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Li1">[33]</xref>. The resulting contigs &gt;100 base pairs long were included in the final assembly. Protein products for these contigs were predicted using ESTScan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Iseli1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Lottaz1">[35]</xref>; all peptides over 30 amino acids were reported. Burrows-Wheeler Aligner was used to align the original reads to the assembled transcriptome to generate relative expression data for the contigs in leaf, bulb and inflorescence tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Li2">[36]</xref>.

Anomalies in the number of reads per contig and abnormally long or short contigs were manually curated. To normalize for read depth, each expression value for each contig was divided by the total reads for the respective tissue and multiplied by 1 million.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The Illumina sequencing of daffodil leaf, bulb and inflorescence tissues resulted in 65 million paired-end reads that were used to make the daffodil transcriptome assembly. The transcriptome assembly consisted of 106,450 sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103223-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) with a mean length of 551 base pairs and a maximum length of 13,381 base pairs. A similar number of &gt;100 base pair sequences were found in the transcriptome of <italic>Chlorophytum borivilianum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Kalra1">[43]</xref>. This mean length indicates a high number of the sequences are long enough for homology searches and cloning work. Of these sequences, 79,980 were predicted to have open reading frames and were translated into peptides. After determining the reads coming from the three tissues, several homologs of genes with predictable expression patterns were used to evaluate the quality of the expression estimations. The RuBisCO large and small subunits have high amounts of expression in the photosynthetic leaf and inflorescence tissues compared to the non-photosynthetic bulb tissue. A homolog to the MADS62 floral development transcription factor is exclusively expressed in the inflorescence tissue as would be expected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Kwantes1">[44]</xref>. The read counts were thus determined to produce expected expression patterns.</p>

<p>The LC/MS/MS data for leaf, bulb, and inflorescence tissues resulted in a pronounced accumulation pattern of galanthamine. The largest concentration was found in bulb tissue, with a lower level found in leaf and the lowest level in inflorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103223-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>Using BLAST to seek homologs to the methyltransferases found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103223.s008">Table S1</xref> yielded 298 methyltransferase candidate genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Raman1">[21]</xref>. Separately, HAYSTACK identified 9,505 contigs that co-express with galanthamine accumulation. A comparison of the two resulting lists revealed one methyltransferase <italic>Np</italic>N4OMT that fits the HAYSTACK model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103223-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). This methyltransferase was chosen for functional analysis. After RACE, <italic>Np</italic>N4OMT was found to be a 239 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight (MW) of 27 kDa. When expressed using the pET28a vector, the added <italic>N</italic>-terminal Histidine tag increased the MW to 29 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103223-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). In the course of cloning, five unique clones were obtained with &gt;96% identity to each other. Due to the two-toned yellow flower color, single flower and size, the daffodil variety used in this study is likely Carlton. Based on genome size estimates, Carlton is thought to be a domesticated form of <italic>Narcissus pseudonarcissus</italic> with a genome duplication event that resulted in a tetraploid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Zonneveld1">[45]</xref>. A high number of paralogs is, therefore, expected. In addition, these bulbs have been propagated vegetatively. For these reasons, the existence of multiple similar sequences is not surprising.</p>

<p>Due to the high similarity of the clones, the first to be cloned was selected for thorough characterization. The clone selected for characterization is 92.5% identical on the amino acid level to the original sequence in the transcriptome assembly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103223.s006">Figure S6</xref>). The recombinant protein was purified with a yield of 16.7 mg protein/L <italic>E. coli</italic> culture. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed the protein to be of apparent homogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103223-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Initial enzyme assays with <italic>Np</italic>N4OMT1 yielded, upon HPLC analysis, a peak with the retention time of 4′-<italic>O</italic>-methylnorbelladine. The vector only control lacks <italic>Np</italic>N4OMT1 but has all other assay components. Therefor the absence of product in the vector control assay excludes the possibility of a background reaction. The absence of product in the assay lacking AdoMet shows that the methyltransferase uses AdoMet as a co-substrate and cannot form product without AdoMet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103223-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The pH optimum was found to be 8.8 and the temperature optimum 45°C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103223.s007">Figure S7B</xref>–C). The Pfs protein, shown purified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103223-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, was added to prevent SAH inhibition in kinetic enzyme assays, through the Pfs catalyzed hydrolysis of SAH to adenine and <italic>S</italic>-ribosyl-homocysteine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-ChoiRhee1">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>An alternative methylation product, 3′-<italic>O-</italic>methylnorbelladine, has the same retention time on HPLC, the same UV profile and MS/MS fragmentation pattern as 4′-<italic>O</italic>-methylnorbelladine. Thus, NMR analysis was performed to determine the regiospecificity of <italic>O</italic>-methylation. HMBC correlations from both the methoxyl protons (δ<sub>H</sub> 3.88) and H-6′ (δ<sub>H</sub> 6.90) to the same carbon (δ<sub>C</sub> 149.9) placed the methoxyl group at C-4′. Its location was further supported by a ROESY correlation from the methoxyl protons to H-5′ (δ<sub>H</sub> 6.98). The NMR data thus confirmed that 4′-<italic>O</italic>-methylnorbelladine is the product of the enzyme reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103223-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine the substrate specificity of this methyltransferase, several similar substrates were tested. Activity comparable to that found with norbelladine was observed using <italic>N</italic>-methylnorbelladine as the substrate. Dopamine also served as a substrate. Under the assay conditions used, product was not detected with caffeic acid, vanillin, 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, and tyramine as substrates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0103223-t001">Table 1</xref>). To determine if the other 4 variants show similar activity, they were purified, and enzymatic activity was confirmed for all variants using norbelladine as the substrate. When monitoring <italic>Np</italic>N4OMT1 norbelladine assays allowed to proceed to completion, no sign of double methylation products were observed as expected.</p>

<p>To validate the expression profiles predicted based on read counts; qRT-PCR was conducted with the same RNA preparation used to prepare the cDNA libraries for Illumina sequencing. The resulting expression profile is slightly different from that obtained from Illumina sequencing. The qRT-PCR expression profile has a higher quantity of inflorescence transcript relative to bulb transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103223-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). This minor difference is potentially due to cross amplification, during qRT-PCR, with other close homologs in the plant.</p>

<p>The expression pattern, product formation and low <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for norbelladine all indicate <italic>Np</italic>N4OMT methylates norbelladine in the proposed galanthamine biosynthetic pathway. Two differing orders of methylation have been proposed for galanthamine biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Ejchhorn1">[10]</xref>. The methylation of <italic>N</italic>-methylnorbelladine was tested to determine if a preference for the <italic>N</italic>-methylation state could be observed at <italic>O</italic>-methylation. Similar <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> values for <italic>N</italic>-methylnorbelladine and norbelladine indicate that a preference for the <italic>N</italic>-methylation state does not occur at <italic>O</italic>-methylation. The results presented here support both proposed galanthamine biosynthetic pathways. Future work on additional enzymes in the pathway will be needed to enzymatically validate one pathway or the other. The lack of enzymatic activity when testing 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde suggests that methylation does not occur prior to formation of norbelladine. The methylation of dopamine is expected considering structural similarity to the methylated moiety of norbelladine. Tyramine was not methylated; this is as expected for a class I OMT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0103223-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Several aspects of the candidate gene selection approach proved important for this successful identification. One is the selection of a variety of methyltransferases for the homology search. If only the known 4-OMTs had been used in the homology search, the gene would have been missed due to the large difference in sequence between known 4-OMTs and <italic>Np</italic>N4OMT. It has been shown that catechol 4′-OMT and catechol 3′-OMT can differ by as little as one amino acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Wils1">[51]</xref>. Because of this potential for a conversion form catechol 3′-<italic>O</italic>-methylation to 4′-<italic>O</italic>-methylation though evolution, OMTs of both positions were used in the homology search. Also, both class I and class II OMTs were used in the search because both classes are known to methylate catechols. Considering the multiple branches of the <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferases in the OMT phylogeny, it is worth investigating enzymes that annotate as <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Raman1">[21]</xref>. For these reasons, the sequences used in the initial BLAST search consisted of representatives of known <italic>O-</italic> and <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferases of small metabolites. The <italic>Np</italic>N4OMT turned out to be a member of the class I OMTs. Class I OMTs show closer homology to human catechol OMT than to all known plant catechol 4-OMTs in class II, as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103223-g004">Figure 4</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Ibdah1">[52]</xref>. The closest known catechol 4-OMT to <italic>Np</italic>N4OMT is bacterial, has 34% identity to <italic>Np</italic>N4OMT and is a class I OMT from <italic>Cyanobacterium Synechocystis</italic> sp. Strain PCC 6803 (<italic>Syn</italic>OMT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Kopycki1">[53]</xref>. Many 3-OMTs show even higher homology to <italic>Np</italic>N4OMT than <italic>Syn</italic>OMT. It is probable that the 4-OMT activity of <italic>Np</italic>N4OMT was acquired independently of <italic>Syn</italic>OMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103223-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p>The second selection criterion, co-expression with galanthamine accumulation, was also of great value. It reduced the number of candidate OMTs from hundreds to one. There are a variety of methods for the prioritization of candidate genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Moreau1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Saito1">[55]</xref>. Many of these methods are oriented towards species and systems for which there are extensive databases or prior knowledge regarding a gene involved in the pathway or process. In one study, a collection of ∼500 microarrays was used to demonstrate the co-expression of genes in the same pathway in Arabidopsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Wei1">[56]</xref>. However, extensive gene expression data are typically not available for non-model systems. There have been several studies that use co-expression analysis to find genes in a pathway and produce promising candidate gene lists. These studies often lack biochemical validation of the in <italic>silico</italic> candidates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Sun1">[57]</xref>. If a novel function is proposed, this type of analysis is incomplete without biochemical validation of enzyme activity. Enzymes that are homologous to functionally equivalent enzymes in a different species can be corroborated by co-expression analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Sun1">[57]</xref>. There are several studies that use a simple differential expression model and microarrays to find biosynthetic genes by comparing biosynthetically active and inactive accessions in rose and strawberry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Aharoni1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Guterman1">[59]</xref>. Differential expression analysis lacks algorithms to use data with differing levels of metabolism occurring in more than two samples. The Pearson correlation can compare data from multiple samples. Mercke et al. have used a Pearson correlation-based method to identify gene expression with microarrays that correlate with levels of specific terpenes in cucumber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Mercke1">[60]</xref>. Illumina-based transcriptomes are, however, more sensitive to minor variants in the sequences and to splice variants. Illumina-based gene expression data also have a far greater dynamic range, limited only by sequence depth, than microarrays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Wang1">[61]</xref>. Subtleties in the sequences that could be missed with microarrays can now be detected with Illumina sequencing.</p>
<p>The use of HAYSTACK as a platform to use the Pearson correlation is ideal because it is designed to receive a hypothesis for gene expression and look for gene expression that correlates with that hypothesis. This is in contrast to an approach in which gene expression patterns are clustered based on similarity to each other. The search for a defined pattern in the data allows the number of required expression data points to be reduced compared to an approach that needs to define clusters of gene expression patterns based on similarity. In HAYSTACK, the shared expression pattern is already defined. HAYSTACK applies additional screening criteria including a p-value test for significance, a fold cutoff and background cutoff. The approach chosen in our study used knowledge of known chemical intermediates, a transcriptome with expression profiles for three tissues, and metabolite levels to identify a candidate gene product to validate with <italic>in vitro</italic> enzyme activity. Little prior knowledge of a pathway is required to use this approach, making this workflow ideal for the identification of genes in unknown biochemical pathways.</p>
<p>There are several modifications to this approach that could be used to improve its power. It could be applied to more tissues, environmental conditions or time points to provide even greater statistical power to correlate co-expression of biosynthetic genes with the biosynthesis of their products. The method could also be modified to include analysis of multiple end products. If the pathway in which the enzyme participates branches, several end products could be equally important to co-expression analysis. This combined consideration of multiple end products could lead to more informative models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Yamazaki1">[62]</xref>. Another potential source of information on the metabolite level could be the concentrations of intermediates made during synthesis. Correlations between biosynthetic gene expression, and perhaps the accumulation of metabolites as well, tend to decrease as distance in a pathway increases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Wei1">[56]</xref>. Experiments that quantitate metabolic intermediates could be useful for finding biosynthetic genes if the flux through the pathway is not so high that intermediates do not accumulate. The latter would be the case in a pathway assembled into a metabolon.</p>
<p>The discovery of this enzyme enables the future elucidation of other enzymes in the proposed galanthamine biosynthetic pathway and other novel pathways. Genes that co-express with <italic>Np</italic>N4OMT can be identified and used as candidate genes for other steps in the proposed galanthamine biosynthetic pathway. This will potentially be useful for earlier steps in the pathway, considering the tendency of expression correlations to decrease as distance in metabolic pathways increase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103223-Wei1">[56]</xref>. This enzyme discovery also validates the utility of this workflow to characterize metabolic pathways and provides a valuable method for pathway discovery in orphan species.</p>
