<abstract>
<p>Stress prolongs the inflammatory response compromising the dermal reconstruction and wound closure. Acute stress-induced inflammation increases indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase-stimulated tryptophan catabolism. To investigate the role of indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase expression and tryptophan administration in adverse effects of stress on cutaneous wound healing, mice were submitted to chronic restraint stress and treated with tryptophan daily until euthanasia. Excisional lesions were created on each mouse and 5 or 7 days later, the lesions were analyzed. In addition, murine skin fibroblasts were exposed to elevated epinephrine levels plus tryptophan, and fibroblast activity was evaluated. Tryptophan administration reversed the reduction of the plasma tryptophan levels and the increase in the plasma normetanephrine levels induced by stress 5 and 7 days after wounding. Five days after wounding, stress-induced increase in the protein levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase, and this was inhibited by tryptophan. Stress-induced increase in the lipid peroxidation and the amount of the neutrophils, macrophages and T cells number was reversed by tryptophan 5 days after wounding. Tryptophan administration inhibited the reduction of myofibroblast density, collagen deposition, re-epithelialization and wound contraction induced by stress 5 days after wounding. In dermal fibroblast culture, the tryptophan administration increased the cell migration and AKT phosphorylation in cells treated with high epinephrine levels. In conclusion, tryptophan-induced reduction of inflammatory response and indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase expression may have accelerated cutaneous wound healing of chronically stressed mice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Stress is the phenomenon in which a potentially harmful stimulus results in physiological or psychological disturbances to homeostasis [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Chronic stress may compromise cutaneous wound healing through prolonged inflammatory response induced by high levels of catecholamines and glucocorticoids [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. An increased inflammatory response blunt the immune response and delays the development of subsequent phases of wound healing impairing wound closure leading to increase in the susceptibility to infections and patients’ mobility [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Several studies have investigated the mechanisms by which stress-induced inflammation compromises the cutaneous wound healing. Recently, it was proposed that suppressive and pro-inflammatory effects of stress may be related to indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO)-mediated tryptophan catabolism [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Tryptophan, an essential amino acid, is the precursor of neurotransmitter serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] which regulates gastrointestinal functions, mood and appetite [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Tryptophan catabolism is mediated by tryptophan dioxygenase activation mainly in the liver or by IDO inducible by bacterial products (as lipopolysaccharide) and pro-inflammatory mediators [as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ)] in several tissues [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Both enzymes are able to catalyze the conversion of tryptophan into kynurenine, quinolinic acid and kynurenic acid through a complex metabolic pathway [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Increased depletion of tryptophan via tryptophan dioxygenase pathway increases the production of kynurenines which inhibit T cell responses and cause the development of dendritic cells with tolerogenic properties [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A diet deficient in tryptophan increases plasma corticosterone levels and reduces plasma 5-HT levels and 5-HT positive cells in the dorsal and median raphe of chronically stressed rats [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Patients submitted to peri-operative stress presents an increase in the kynurenine/tryptophan ration which might contribute to the increased risk of infection and postoperative immunosuppressive states [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In addition, the increase in the tryptophan catabolism and serotonin degradation is related to schizophrenia and major depression in human [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus, some studies have proposed that the L-tryptophan administration may be an alternative method to reverse the effect of stress on immune system and behavior.</p>
<p>Firstly it was proposed that the dietary supplementation with tryptophan associated to anti-depressives could attenuate the depressive disturbs in stressed patients [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Carbohydrate-rich diets may raise the plasma tryptophan levels and decrease depressive mood and plasma cortisol levels during acute laboratory stress in humans [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Diets with high levels of tryptophan diminish plasma concentrations of cortisol and noradrenaline and enhance the recovery after social stress in pigs [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In mice, the treatment with L-tryptophan may have an anti-inflammatory action reducing pancreatitis, stomach ulceration and contact hypersensitivity through increased production of interleukin-10 and decreased synthesis of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus, anti-inflammatory action of tryptophan administration may be helpful to reduce the immunosuppressive effects of stress improving cutaneous wound healing.</p>
<p>Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of L-tryptophan administration on cutaneous wound healing in chronically stressed mice. In addition, this study evaluated the effects of high epinephrine concentrations and L-tryptophan on murine skin fibroblast cultures. We show that tryptophan administration inhibits stress-induced IDO activation and skin inflammation accelerating the cutaneous wound healing of mice. We also demonstrate that tryptophan directly reverses the impairment in the migration of murine dermal fibroblasts through AKT phosphorylation.</p>

<title>Material and Methods</title>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>Male Swiss mice with 3 months of age were kept in groups (5 animals per cage) under controlled conditions with 12 hour light/dark cycle. All procedures were carried out in strict accordance with the Brazilian Legislation regarding Animal Experimentation (no 11.794, from October 8, 2008). All experiments in this study were approved by the Ethical Committee for Animal Use of the State University of Rio de Janeiro (Permit Number: 027/2014). All surgery was performed under ketamine and xylazine anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec004">
<title>Restraint stress</title>
<p>Animals (n = 40) were daily restrained in well-ventilated, plastic and cylindrical tubes [10.5 cm (height) x 4.5 cm (internal diameter)] for 1 hour per day, until euthanasia. Mice did not have access to food or water while in the tubes. Nonstressed groups (n = 40) were deprived food and water during the same time period, although they were free to roam in their cages [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Restraint stress was performed between 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec005">
<title>Administration of L-tryptophan</title>
<p>From 1 day after the beginning of the stress protocol, a group of stressed and nonstressed animals was intraperitoneally treated with 50 mg/kg of L-tryptophan (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) dissolved in 0.9% saline and 0.1N hydrochloric acid (9:1), daily until euthanasia. Another group of stressed and nonstressed animals was treated only with vehicle. The administration of L-tryptophan or vehicle was performed after restraint stress between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. Study dose was adapted from previous study where rats with experimental ulcers received 100 mg/kg/day of L-tryptophan [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Thus, mice were divided into four groups as follows (20 animals per group): <italic>nonstressed group</italic>: animals not stressed that received only vehicle; <italic>nonstressed+tryptophan group</italic>: animals not stressed that received tryptophan; <italic>stressed group</italic>: animals stressed that received only vehicle; <italic>stressed+tryptophan group</italic>: animals stressed that received tryptophan. During the study, all mice were fed with standard chow containing 157 mg of tryptophan per 100 g of chow (PragSoluções Bioscience, São Paulo, Brazil) ad libitum and had free access to water.</p>

<sec id="sec006">
<title>Wound model</title>
<p>Two days after the beginning of the stress protocol, all animals were intraperitoneally anesthetized with ketamine (150 mg/kg) and xylazine (15 mg/kg). After shaving the dorsum, two circular full-thickness excisional wounds were created using a biopsy punch with 8 mm diameter. The lesions were separated by a bridge of normal skin and located 2 cm from the occipital bone of the cranium. The wounds were not sutured or covered and healed by secondary intention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec007">
<title>Macroscopic analysis</title>
<p>To evaluate wound contraction, lesions were measured soon after wounding and after 3, 5 and 7 days later without scab removal as described [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The results were expressed as percentage of the original wound area. To evaluate re-epithelialization, the margins of the total wound area and non-re-epithelialized wound area were measured 7 days after wounding as described [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The results were expressed as percentage of the re-epithelialized wound area.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec008">
<title>Tissue harvesting and microscopic analysis</title>
<p>One hour after the tryptophan or vehicle injection, mice (10 animals per day) were intraperitoneally anesthetized with ketamine (150 mg/kg) and xylazine (15 mg/kg) 5 or 7 days after wounding. One hour after anesthesia, mice were decapitated and the peripheral blood was collected and plasma was frozen at -70°C. Thereafter, lesions and adjacent normal skin samples of five animals per group were collected, and these tissue samples were formalin-fixed (pH 7.2) and paraffin-embedded. For each group, lesions of five animals per group were collected and frozen at -70°C. Frozen lesions were macerated in lysis buffer and total protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockwood, TN). This lysate was used to perform lipid peroxide levels, ELISA and immunoblotting.</p>
<p>Sections (5 μm thick) were stained with hematoxylin-eosin to measure migratory tongue length. For this, slides were digitalized using Pannoramic Digital Slide Scanner (3DHistech Ltd., Budapest, Hungary). The migratory tongue length was measured using Pannoramic Viewer software (3DHistech Ltd., Budapest, Hungary). Length was defined as the distance (in micrometers) from the wound edge to the tip of the tongue as described [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The results were presented in μm.</p>

<sec id="sec009">
<title>Immunohistochemistry and quantification</title>
<p>Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate the amount of neutrophils (myeloperoxidase), macrophages (F4/80) and T cells (CD-3). The following antibodies were used: rat monoclonal to myeloperoxidase (#71674; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; 1:500), rat monoclonal to F4/80 (#497; Serotec Inc., Raleigh, NC; 1:500) and rabbit polyclonal to CD-3 (#5690; Abcam, Boston, MA; 1:100) as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. To quantify the number of immunostained cells, five random fields per animal (14,689 μm<sup>2</sup>) were analyzed as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The results were presented as cells per mm<sup>2</sup>. To observe the distribution of serotonin receptor-7 (SR-7)-positive cells in skin and wound area of nonstressed mice, sections were also incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody to SR-7 (#28963; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:500).</p>
<p>Quantification of myofibroblasts was performed using sections immunolabelled with mouse monoclonal antibody to α-smooth muscle actin (#0851; DAKO, Carpinteria, CA; 1:100) plus anti-mouse EnVision System (#4001; DAKO; 1:20) as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Volume density of myofibroblasts was evaluated using point counting, x40 objective lens and videomicroscopic system as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The results were presented as volume density of myofibroblasts (Vv<sub>[myofibroblasts]</sub>%).</p>

<sec id="sec010">
<title>Immunoblotting</title>
<p>Proteins were separated by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and probed with antibodies: rabbit polyclonal to IDO (45 KDa) (#106134; Abcam; 1:50), rabbit polyclonal to SR-7 (43–45 KDa) (#28963; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:200), goat polyclonal to monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) (12 KDa) (#1784; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:200), rabbit polyclonal to active transforming growth factor (TGF-β)-1/2/3 (17 KDa) (#7892; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:200), mouse monoclonal to collagen type III (138 KDa) (#3392; Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA; 1:600), mouse polyclonal to collagen type I (140–210 KDa) (#765; Chemicon International, Inc.; 1:500) or mouse monoclonal to β-actin (42 KDa) (#5441; Sigma-Aldrich; 1:1000). Following incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, immune complexes were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The β-actin was used as a loading control protein and the results were expressed as arbitrary units.</p>

<sec id="sec011">
<title>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA)</title>
<p>The protein levels of TNF-α were measured using an ELISA assay (#555268; BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). The assay was performed according to the manufacturers’ instructions. The results were presented as pg TNF-α per mg total protein.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec012">
<title>Biochemical analyses</title>
<p>To confirm the stress-induced physiological alterations, norepinephrine synthesis was indirectly estimated by assaying the plasma levels of normetanephrine, which is a major and stable metabolic end-product of norepinephrine, as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The results were expressed as ng/μl of normetanephrine.</p>
<p>To confirm the efficiency of L-tryptophan administration, the plasma levels of L-tryptophan were determined in wound lysate using a colorimetric assay as described [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The results were expressed as mg/ml of L-tryptophan.</p>
<p>To evaluate the lipid peroxidation, the levels of lipid peroxides were measured in wound lysate using the ferrous oxidation-xylenol orange method as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The results were expressed as nmol lipid peroxides per μg total protein.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec013">
<title>Behavior evaluation</title>
<p>Another experiment was performed using the same stress protocol to examine locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior. For this, a group of animals (n = 5) was evaluated before and after 8 days of restraint stress (corresponding to 5 days after wounding). These animals were not treated with L-tryptophan or vehicle and did not receive cutaneous lesions.</p>
<p>In the open-field test, the animals were placed in the center of a white plastic cage (40 x 33 x 17 cm) containing 16 rectangles (9.5 x 8.5 cm). The number of the covered rectangles for each animal was counted for 5 minutes [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For analysis, a Sony video-camera and monitor (Sony, United Kingdom) were used. These results were expressed number of rectangles per minute.</p>
<p>In the elevated plus-maze, the animals were placed on the central platform of the plus-maze consisted of two open and two closed arms (10 cm wide x 50 cm long, 50 cm walls for closed, 1 cm walls for open) elevated 40 cm off the floor (Insight, São Paulo, Brazil). Each animal was tested for 5 minutes on the maze. The percentage of time spent in open arms provided as the measures of anxiety was calculated for each animal [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>

<sec id="sec014">
<title>Cell culture</title>
<p>Primary fibroblasts were isolated from the skin of nonstressed Swiss mice (1–2 months) by the standard explant technique as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Cultilab Ltda, Campinas, Brazil) and antibiotics (100 UI/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 6 μg/ml amphotericin B) (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells were seeded for experiments when they reached about 95% confluence. Experiments were performed at passages 3 to 10, at least three times, in triplicate.</p>
<p>In all experiments, cells were treated with epinephrine (100 μM) (Hipolabor, Minas Gerais, Brazil), L-tryptophan (10 μM) (Sigma-Aldrich), or epinephrine plus L-tryptophan [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The dose of 10 μM of L-tryptophan was based on a dose-dependent and time-dependent study (data not shown) and previous study [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Drugs were prepared in DMEM with 2% FBS and antibiotics.</p>

<title>Cell viability assay</title>
<p>Cell viability was determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium assay [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For this, fibroblasts (3 x 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well) were treated and after 1, 2 or 3 days of treatment, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium solution (Sigma-Aldrich) was added [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The results were expressed as the percentage of the control (medium-only) group.</p>

<sec id="sec016">
<title>Cell migration assay</title>
<p>Cell migration was assessed by the ability of cells to move into an acellular area in a two-dimensional scratch assay [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Fibroblasts (2.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well) were treated and a scratch was made in the center of the well with a 100 μl pipette tip. The denuded area was measured soon after scratching and at 1, 2 and 3 days later. The results were expressed as the percentage of the initial denuded area.</p>

<title>Immunoblot for activation of AKT, IDO and SR-7</title>
<p>To evaluate the AKT phosphorylation, fibroblasts (5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well) were incubated in serum-free DMEM alone (control) or serum-free DMEM containing epinephrine or epinephrine plus L-tryptophan for 15 minutes. After treatment, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and scraped in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 138 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor cocktail, 50 mM sodium fluorite, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate) (Sigma-Aldrich). Proteins were resolved by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and immunoblotted with rabbit polyclonal antibodies for Akt1/2/3 (#8312) or phospho-AKT 1/2/3 Ser 473 (#33437; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:200) as described [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. To confirm the protein expression of IDO and SR-7 in dermal fibroblast culture, cells (5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well) in DMEM with 2% FBS and were scraped in lysis buffer. The protein levels of IDO and SR-7 were estimated in protein extract using western immunoblot protocol as described above. The results were expressed as arbitrary units.</p>

<title>L-tryptophan administration reduces stress-induced tryptophan catabolism through IDO and TNF-α</title>
<p>Psychological stress increases the protein expression of TNF-α in wounded area of mice when compared to nonstressed mice [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. To investigate the effects of psychological stress and L-tryptophan administration on TNF-α synthesis, the protein levels of TNF-α were measured on wound area of studied groups through ELISA assay.

There was no difference in TNF-α protein levels between nonstressed and nonstressed+tryptophan groups 5 days of wounding (<xref rid="pone.0128439.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Recently it was demonstrated that pro-inflammatory response to stress is involved to tryptophan catabolism through interferon-γ, TNF-α and IDO induction in mice brain [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. We verified if L-tryptophan administration could reduce IDO protein levels in wound area of stressed mice. Five days after wounding, restrained stress increased protein levels of IDO in wound area when compared to nonstressed group (<xref rid="pone.0128439.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). The L-tryptophan administration attenuated the effect of stress on IDO protein expression 5 days after wounding (<xref rid="pone.0128439.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). There was no difference in IDO protein expression between nonstressed and nonstressed+tryptophan groups 5 days of wounding (<xref rid="pone.0128439.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). We also observed that skin fibroblasts incubated in medium alone expressed IDO proteins (<xref rid="pone.0128439.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Acute stress-stimulated induction of IDO in mice may decrease the plasma levels of tryptophan and serotonin [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. To investigate the effect of psychological stress and L-tryptophan administration on skin regulation by serotonin, SR-7 protein expression was detected. Initially, we demonstrated that SR-7 was expressed in normal skin and wound area of mice which were not submitted to stress or received tryptophan. For this, the immunostaining for SR-7 were performed in normal skin and wound area of mice. The SR-7 staining was observed in keratinocytes (granular layer) and fibroblastic-like cells of wound area and normal skin of mice which were not submitted to stress model or received tryptophan (<xref rid="pone.0128439.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). In addition, skin fibroblasts incubated in medium alone also expressed SR-7 protein (<xref rid="pone.0128439.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>).

However, L-tryptophan administration reduced the effect of stress on SR-7 protein expression (<xref rid="pone.0128439.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Several studies have demonstrated that psychological stress impairs the cutaneous wound healing in humans, and rodent models [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The primary mechanism by which stress compromises cutaneous wound healing is through prolonged inflammatory response induced by high levels of catecholamines and glucocorticoids. During the early phases of wound healing, psychological stress may suppress the infiltration of inflammatory cells and the synthesis of TNF-α through the immunosuppressive effects of norepinephrine and glucocorticoids [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Long-term exposure to norepinephrine and glucocorticoids leads to resistance in inflammatory cells (such as neutrophils and macrophages), thus inducing an increased inflammatory response and delaying the development of subsequent phases of wound healing [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Recently, it was demonstrated that acute stress induces a new inflammatory pathway which suppresses immune functions [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The acute stress-induced increase of TNF-α and IFN-γ synthesis activates the expression of mRNA IDO in the brain, lung and spleen of the mice increasing plasma levels of kynurenine and reducing the plasma levels of tryptophan and serotonin [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The derivates of tryptophan catabolism by IDO (as kynurenine and kynurenic acid) reduce T cell proliferation and the thickness of the thymic cortex of repeatedly stressed mice contributing to immunosuppressive effects and mood alterations [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In depressed patients, the increase in the plasma TNF-α and IFN-γ levels may be associated to the reduction of the plasma tryptophan levels [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. These observations prompted us to investigate whether the IDO-mediated tryptophan catabolism participates in adverse effects of stress on cutaneous wound healing. In addition to determine whether the inhibition of this pathway by tryptophan administration could promote the wound healing of stressed mice. To induce chronic psychological stress, animals were submitted to restrained stress model which is a well-defined psychological stress model with laboratory mice that compromises the animals’ housing leading to anxiety-like behavior, minor locomotor activity and excessive catecholamine synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Previous study has demonstrated that human dermal fibroblasts express IDO mRNA and the activation of IDO by IFN-γ stimulates the tryptophan catabolism and kynurenine synthesis in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In our study, the cutaneous lesions and skin fibroblasts of nonstressed mice expressed protein IDO and its expression is increased by chronic stress. In addition, restraint stress also decreased plasma tryptophan levels, but reduced the protein TNF-α levels in the wound area of mice. When stressed mice were treated with tryptophan not only there was a noticeable reduction of protein IDO and TNF-α levels, but also a strong increase in the plasma tryptophan levels. These results suggest that tryptophan administration may have inhibited the activation of IDO-mediated tryptophan catabolism on wound area contributing to reduction of the immunosuppressive and pro-inflammatory effects of chronic stress on cutaneous wound healing. This idea is reinforced by the increase in SR-7 protein levels on wound area of stressed mice. Mice skin expresses seven subtypes of SR (as SR-1A/1B and SR-7) in melanocytes and fibroblasts and is capable to produce serotonin [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Repeatedly restraint stress reduces the serum and skin levels of 5-HT and the levels of SR-1A and SR-1B mRNA in mice skin, but increases SR-7 mRNA levels in mice submitted to chronic unpredictable stress [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. We believed that SR-7 protein expression in wound area of stressed mice may have been sensitive to the stress-stimulated reduction of serotonin levels. Therefore, SR-7 expression on wound area may be an additional evidence for the inhibitory effect of tryptophan on IDO-induced tryptophan catabolism pathway stimulated by stress.</p>
<p>Chronically stressed mice presented an exacerbate inflammatory response (as increased number of neutrophils, macrophages and T cells, and TNF-α protein levels) in wound area which was inhibited by tryptophan administration. These results are similar to previous studies where elevated levels of stress hormones prolong inflammatory responses compromising the development of its subsequent phases [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Some studies demonstrate that stress-induced activation of IDO may reduce T cell proliferation and the thickness of thymic cortex in mice [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In addition, GCN2 kinase phosphorylation via IDO induction may promote the proliferative arrest and anergy induction in mice T cells [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The supplementation with tryptophan may reverse IDO-mediated suppression of CD8<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells isolated from murine tumor-draining lymph nodes [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Thus, we suggest that tryptophan-induced reduction of the TNF-α and IDO expression on wound area may have improved the local inflammatory response and promoted the dermal reconstruction and wound closure. Studies with gastric ulceration in rats demonstrate that tryptophan administration has anti-inflammatory action due to inhibition of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer in activated B cells [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In our study, we also propose that anti-inflammatory effects of tryptophan may be related to MCP-1, a key molecule for chemotaxis and activation of macrophages [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], since tryptophan administration reversed the increase in MCP-1 protein levels in wound area of stressed mice. A surprising result was the tryptophan-induced reduction of the lipid peroxidation in wound area of stressed mice. Chronic stress-stimulated high levels of catecholamines increase the oxidative damage in lipids in mice cutaneous lesions and murine dermal fibroblast culture [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This observation may indicate that tryptophan administration may have an antioxidant effect on cutaneous wound repair of stressed mice for a mechanism is not still understood. Nonetheless, the antioxidant effects of tryptophan are reinforced by a previous study where a diet rich in tryptophan reduces the expression of mRNA for superoxide dismutase in the ulcerated mucosa of rats [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
<p>The adverse effects of chronic stress on dermal reconstruction and wound contraction are associated to two events: stress-induced prolonged skin inflammation and epinephrine-induced impairment of the skin fibroblast and keratinocyte activity [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In addition, stress-induced catecholamines delay myofibroblastic differentiation, but reduce collagen deposition leading to the imbalance between myofibroblast-extracellular matrix and the impairment of the wound contraction [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Human keratinocyte migration is delayed by high levels of epinephrine through the reduction of the AKT phosphorylation [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In murine dermal fibroblasts, stress-induced epinephrine enhances myofibroblastic differentiation through increased expression of latent TGF-β 1/2/3, but decreases cell migration and collagen deposition [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In this study, we observed that tryptophan was capable to reverse the increase in the myofibroblastic differentiation and protein TGF-β levels, and the reduction of collagen type I deposition in wound area of stressed mice. In addition, tryptophan promoted keratinocyte migration (migratory tongue length) leading to increased re-epithelialization. We suggest that tryptophan-induced reduction of the local inflammatory response may be one of factors which leaded to acceleration of the dermal reconstruction, re-epithelialization and wound contraction. However, the positive effects of tryptophan on dermal reconstruction may be involved to dermal fibroblast activity. It has been demonstrated that high levels of epinephrine decreases the migration of murine dermal fibroblasts through the inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) ⁄AKT pathway. Tryptophan administration did not alter the viability of epinephrine-treated fibroblasts, but strongly inhibited the effects of epinephrine on fibroblast migration and AKT phosphorylation. These findings may be associated to the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. The activation of mTOR via PI3K/AKT pathway promotes the initiation of ribosomal translation which is essential to growth factor signaling [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128439.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In T cells, the IDO induction decreases the free tryptophan which blocks the activation of mTOR contributing to immunosuppression [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Chronic stress decreases mTOR phosphorylation in the amygdala of rats through the reduction of AKT and extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 activation [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Recently, it was demonstrated that PI3K/AKT activation promotes the proliferation and migration of keratinocytes and accelerates cutaneous wound healing of mice via mTOR [<xref rid="pone.0128439.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Thus, the mechanism by which tryptophan inhibits the adverse effects of stress on dermal reconstruction and wound contraction is not only through the normalization of skin inflammation, but also through this direct effect on migration of dermal fibroblasts probably by the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>L-tryptophan administration improves the cutaneous wound healing of the chronically stressed mice probably by the inhibition of the TNF-α-induced activation of IDO. In mice, the reduction of the immunosuppressive and pro-inflammatory effects of chronic stress by tryptophan normalizes the inflammatory responses, decreases the lipid peroxidation and improves the myofibroblastic differentiation, collagen deposition, re-epithelialization and wound contraction. In addition, L-tryptophan administration promotes the migration of murine dermal fibroblasts exposed to high epinephrine level through the increase in the AKT phosphorylation.</p>
