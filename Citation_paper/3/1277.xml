<abstract>
<p>A network approach to brain and dynamics opens new perspectives towards understanding of its function. The functional connectivity from functional MRI recordings in humans is widely explored at large scale, and recently also at the voxel level. The networks of dynamical directed connections are far less investigated, in particular at the voxel level. To reconstruct full brain effective connectivity network and study its topological organization, we present a novel approach to multivariate Granger causality which integrates information theory and the architecture of the dynamical network to efficiently select a limited number of variables. The proposed method aggregates conditional information sets according to community organization, allowing to perform Granger causality analysis avoiding redundancy and overfitting even for high-dimensional and short datasets, such as time series from individual voxels in fMRI. We for the first time depicted the voxel-wise hubs of incoming and outgoing information, called Granger causality density (GCD), as a complement to previous repertoire of functional and anatomical connectomes. Analogies with these networks have been presented in most part of default mode network; while differences suggested differences in the specific measure of centrality. Our findings could open the way to a new description of global organization and information influence of brain function. With this approach is thus feasible to study the architecture of directed networks at the voxel level and individuating hubs by investigation of degree, betweenness and clustering coefficient.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is increasingly being used to investigate brain dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Sporns1">[1]</xref>. The dynamical integration between brain areas, evidencing neuronal communications beyond the underlying anatomical structure, is investigated by functional and effective connectivity. Functional connectivity (FC) measures statistical dependencies of time-series between distinct units; while effective connectivity (EC) investigates the influence one neuronal system exerts over another, by means of predictive models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Friston1">[2]</xref>. The former has been comprehensively described and integrated in the functional connectome of the human brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Bullmore1">[3]</xref>. Nevertheless, only a few studies have investigated the large-scale directed influence brain network based on EC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Yan1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Liao1">[5]</xref>, though not yet at the voxel level.</p>
<p>Once that the architecture of a neural network is known, it is possible to identify its functional hubs and critical nodes, determining preferred pathways of neuronal communication and estimating the controllability of a system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Liu1">[6]</xref>, or to use the graph structure as a decoding tool for brain states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Richiardi1">[7]</xref>. A graph-theoretical approach to whole brain functional connectivity, based on the count of the number of functional connections per voxel (edges in graph) has been successfully applied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Eguiluz1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Zuo1">[15]</xref> allowing to identify the distribution of functional hubs. Prominent functional hubs were identified in the default mode network as well as in dorsal, parietal and prefrontal regions.</p>
<p>A significant advance in the understanding of brain function could come from the investigation of directed networks of information transfer, such as those based on effective connectivity. The models on which effective connectivity is based can either be physiologically motivated, such as dynamical causal models, or purely data-driven such as in Granger causality (GC) analysis (for an extensive review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Friston2">[16]</xref>). GC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Granger1">[17]</xref>, which evaluates whether the prediction error on one variable is significantly reduced by including another variable in the autoregressive (AR) model, has been used to identify the effective connectivity of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Roebroeck1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Uddin1">[20]</xref>. It is worth to note that the application of GC to fMRI is controversial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Friston3">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Roebroeck2">[22]</xref>, especially for resting-state fMRI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Friston2">[16]</xref>. Nonetheless, the analogies and differences between network architectures of functional connectivity and GC-based effective connectivity have been investigated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Liao1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Zhou1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Liao2">[24]</xref>. Those studies are based on coarse-grained parcellations from anatomically based brain atlases. Little is known on the functional hubs in voxel-wise EC network. The main issue arising when applying Granger causality to high dimensional networks, such as voxel time series from the whole brain, is the curse of dimensionality in the conditioning variables.</p>
<p>To cope with redundancy and dimensionality issues in evaluating multivariate GC, it has recently been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Marinazzo1">[25]</xref> that conditioning on a small number of variables, chosen as the most informative ones for each given driver, can be enough to recover a network of effective connectivity eliminating spurious influences in particular when the connectivity pattern is sparse. We refer to this approach as the partially conditioned GC (PCGC). Another issue related with the recovery of EC networks from BOLD signal is the possibly confounding effect of the hemodynamic response. In order to decouple the neuronal activity and the hemodynamic responses, we applied a blind deconvolution procedure, based on the detection of pseudo-events, to the BOLD signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Wu1">[26]</xref>.</p>

<title>Subjects and Data Acquisition</title>
<p>The resting-state fMRI dataset used in this study has been publicly released under the ‘1000 Functional Connectomes Project’ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org" xlink:type="simple">http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org</ext-link>, accessed March 2012).and has been collected at the State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning at Beijing Normal University (n = 197, 122 females; age: 21.2±1.8 years). All participants had no history of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant, and the study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board. During the resting state, participants were instructed to keep still with their eyes closed but not to fall asleep, remaining as motionless as possible. The fMRI images were acquired by using single-shot gradient echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence (repetition time (TR): 2000 ms; echo time: 30 ms; axial slices: 33; thickness: 3 mm; inter-slice gap: 0.6 mm; field of view: 200×200 mm<sup>2</sup>; in-plane resolution: 64×64; flip angle: 90°). For each subject, a total of 225-volumes were acquired, resulting in a total scan time of 450 s.</p>

<title>Data Preprocessing</title>
<p>Preprocessing of resting-state images was performed using SPM8: data underwent slice timing correction, realigning of all the images to the first image using six degrees of freedom rigid body transformations, spatial normalization into the Montreal Neurological Institute template then resampling to 3-mm isotropic voxels, and spatial smoothing using a 6-mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel. Recently, small head movements have been identified as an important confounding factor for resting state fMRI studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Power2">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-VanDijk1">[29]</xref>. To limit the impact of micro-movements artifacts on these data, we implemented a ‘scrubbing’ procedure as part of data preprocessing. An estimate of head motion at each time point was calculated as the frame-wise displacement (FD) (mean absolute FD across all subject = 0.104±0.045 mm), using six displacements from rigid body motion correction procedure mentioned above <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Power2">[27]</xref>. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Carp1">[30]</xref>, any image with FD&gt;0.5 mm was removed and replaced by a linear interpolation.</p>
<p>Additional parameters were used to remove possible spurious variances from the data through linear regression. These were 1) six head motion parameters obtained in the realigning step, 2) signal from a region in cerebrospinal fluid, 3) signal from a region centered in the white matter, 4) global signal averaged over the whole brain. Time series were linearly detrended and temporally band-pass filtered (0.01–0.08 Hz). We then generated a study-specific functional volume mask that included only voxels present in all participants.</p>

<title>Spontaneous Point Event Detection and HRF Deconvolution</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that the hemodynamic processes are inhomogeneous across the whole brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Handwerker1">[31]</xref>; in order to maximally eliminate the effect of hemodynamic response which may disturb the inference of temporal precedence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-ValdesSosa1">[32]</xref>, we employed a blind deconvolution technique developed for resting-state BOLD-fMRI signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Wu1">[26]</xref>, starting from the idea that the resting-state BOLD spikes are due to spontaneous point events, based on the increasing evidence of non-random patterns of BOLD spike that govern the dynamics of the brain at rest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Deco1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Davis1">[35]</xref>. These spontaneous events can be detected by point process analysis (PPA), picking up BOLD fluctuations of relatively large amplitude <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Tagliazucchi1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Tagliazucchi2">[37]</xref>. After detecting these resting-state BOLD transients, the neural event onsets are stored for further HRF reconstruction. Voxel-specific HRF is obtained by fitting raw BOLD signal with canonical HRF and its time derivative, in order to finally recover signals at the neural level by Wiener deconvolution (Matlab code is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://users.ugent.be/~dmarinaz/code.html" xlink:type="simple">http://users.ugent.be/~dmarinaz/code.html</ext-link>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Glover1">[38]</xref>.</p>

<title>Partially Conditioned Granger Causality</title>
<p>Partially conditioned Granger causality (PCGC) was originally proposed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Marinazzo1">[25]</xref> as a technique able to compute the GC conditioned to a small number of variables in the framework of information theory. The idea is that conditioning on a small number of the most informative variables for the candidate driver variable is sufficient to remove indirect interactions especially for sparse connectivity patterns. Here we briefly report the foundations of the approach.</p>
<p>Let’s consider <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> covariance-stationary variables <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; the state vectors, representing the past realizations up to a lag <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are denoted as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> The multivariate Granger causality from variable <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to variable <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is defined as the logarithm of the ratio of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the mean squared error prediction of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on the basis of all the vectors <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the mean squared error prediction of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on the basis of the past of all variables but <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. What was proposed is a reduction of the number of variables to be included in the conditioning dataset.</p>
<p>The PCGC index <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>is defined as follows:<disp-formula id="pone.0073670.e015"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e015" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>is a set of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> variables, in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, most informative for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>In order to choose the first variable of the subset, the mutual information between the candidate driver variable and each of the other variables is estimated; the second variable of the subset is selected among the remaining ones, as those that, jointly with the previously chosen variable, maximize the mutual information with the driver variable. Then, one keeps adding the rest of the variables by iterating this procedure. This is repeated until the addition of another variable does not result in a substantial information gain.</p>
<p>The model order for PCGC analysis can be chosen by standard methods such as the Akaike information criterion, the Bayesian information Criterion or leave-one-out cross validation. In the following analysis we set <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, as in other fMRI studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Roebroeck1">[18]</xref>. From now on we refer to this data-driven method as PCGC<italic><sup>d</sup></italic>.</p>
<p>The statistical significance of Granger causality value was estimated under the null hypothesis of zero influence, with a standard F-test on the restricted and unrestricted AR model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Geweke1">[39]</xref>.</p>
<p>In order to cope with extra-large data sets, such as voxel-wise fMRI data, an additional strategy to reduce the number of conditioning variables is in order. In this study it is proposed to make use of the community structure of the data. This procedure, indicated as PCGC<italic><sup>t</sup></italic>, exploits a hierarchical partition, at two resolutions, of the brain signal. It consists of the following steps:</p>
<p>[1]. Considering each potential driver voxel <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the whole ensemble of voxels (excluding <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) <italic>S</italic> is divided into <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> systems: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, such as the signal for the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> systems is obtained aggregating voxels inside each system <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> resulting in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>[2]. Each system is further partitioned into subsystems <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, such that now the signal within the subsystems of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is given by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, being <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the mean signal of the variables <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> belonging to the subsystem <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>[3].

<p>For voxel-wise analysis, excluding the special case in which <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a small subset containing all the informative variables, the observation is always much smaller than the number of predictors in Eq. 2, resulting in a singular matrix in the computation of the regression coefficients. Moreover, predictors will also face a high degree of multicollinearity (predictors too are redundant). As a consequence estimation of regression coefficients in CGC may change erratically in response to small changes in the data.</p>
<p>According to our algorithm, the coefficients of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> will have the same given weight; different weights will be assigned to the coefficients of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, thus<disp-formula id="pone.0073670.e054"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denotes the Kronecker product and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is changed according to the dimension of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>So, in the proposed algorithm, even if we only consider a few conditioning variables <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we are potentially taking into account all the information needed to partial out possible indirect causal influences, and avoiding multicollinearity in regression analysis models.</p>
<p>In order to achieve effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed scheme, the predictors should be reasonably aggregated into groups, ensuring that they contribute with approximately equal weights to the dependent variable. Since the construction of a pair-wise correlation matrix will yield indications on the likelihood that predictor variables are multicollinear/redundant, we can group the predictors after detecting community structure from the correlation matrix. We then average the predictors which contain the redundant information about the dependent variable to avoid overfitting in regression analysis model. Considering that spatially connected voxels will most likely display similar BOLD signal, we can find community structure on a coarse resolution under the local mean-field assumption.</p>

<p>First, the preprocessed functional images were parcellated into 90 (45 for each hemisphere) non-cerebellar anatomical regions of interest (ROIs) using automated anatomical labeling (AAL) template <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-TzourioMazoyer1">[40]</xref>.

<title>Centrality Indices</title>
<p>Degree centrality (DC) is the sum of the weights of edges connected to a node, i.e. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Nodes with high DC can be considered as hubs for information integration.</p>
<p>Betweenness centrality (BC) is a measure based on shortest paths, widely used in complex network analysis.

<p>Clustering coefficient (CC) is defined as the number of connections among the neighbors of a particular node. It reflects the local efficiency of information transfer in the graph.

<title>Voxel-wise Granger Causality Network</title>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073670-g004">Fig. 4</xref> the voxel-wise PCGC<italic><sup>t</sup></italic> network is represented using a network layout at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for each subject. This network of directed information is divided in modules which are then mapped on the brain. For a better visualization, only nodes with degree &gt;11 are reported in the figure. The purple cluster, containing the posterior regions of the default mode network is intensely interconnected to other modules. In particular it appears to send directed information to the anterior regions (pink cluster) rather than receiving, providing additional details to previous results on the directionality of information flow in the default mode network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Jiao1">[46]</xref>. The salmon cluster, containing the thalamus and the putamen, does not have strong connections to the other modules. These results are consistent with those reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-vandenHeuvel1">[51]</xref>, in which it was shown that all midline cortical rich-club nodes (i.e., bilateral precuneus, superior frontal, superior parietal) are connector hubs, playing an important role in between-module connectivity, while subcortical rich-club regions (bilateral thalamus, putamen) play an important role in module structure.</p>
<p>Considering that the graph we focused on is directed, each node’s incoming degree and outgoing degree must also be considered separately <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Liao2">[24]</xref>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Large-scale integration of information across brain regions is investigated by both functional and anatomical connectomes. In this study, to extend human brain connectomic repertoire, we first constructed the effective connectivity network using voxel-wise Granger causality on resting-state fMRI data. To cope with dimensionality issues for voxel-wise Granger causality and to decouple the neuronal activity and hemodynamic responses of resting-state fMRI, we proposed the partially conditioned Granger causality (PCGC) and blind deconvolution using the spontaneous events detected in BOLD signal. The convergence and divergence of hub regions between functional and effective connectivity network were documented.</p>

<title>Directed Network Centrality Mapping</title>
<p>Specific network centrality measures have been primarily focused on the identification of the human brain hubs at regional <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Salvador1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-He1">[55]</xref> and voxel level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Tomasi1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Zuo1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Tomasi2">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Joyce1">[56]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-vandenHeuvel2">[58]</xref>. Brain hubs take a central position in a network and play a crucial role in fast transfer and efficient integration of information across the human connectome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Bullmore1">[3]</xref>. In this study, hubs of directed brain network were generally identified by high levels of degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and clustering coefficient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Bullmore1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-vandenHeuvel2">[58]</xref>. As an addition to previous findings in structural and functional connectomes, here for the first time the voxel-wise centrality-based characteristics of information flow in the human brain directed network was reported. Some regions have been found to be consistently hubs across various modalities (e.g., fMRI vs. DTI) and different dynamical connectivity approaches (FC vs. EC), such as posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, medial prefrontal cortex, lateral parietal and temporal cortex, insula. Also, some regions displayed remarkable differences (e.g., cuneus), due to the specific measure of centrality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Zuo1">[15]</xref>, the parcellation scale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Wang1">[41]</xref> and brain connectivity definition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Hagmann1">[53]</xref> employed. Nonetheless, our findings suggest that higher order cortical association regions acted as pivotal incoming or outgoing hubs, maintaining information flow even in resting state.</p>
<p>Although pivotal hubs have already been found within single resting-state network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Jiao1">[46]</xref>, among multiple networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Liao1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Sridharan1">[19]</xref>, and even in large-scale whole brain network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Yan1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Liao2">[24]</xref>, uncovering voxel-wise centrality hubs on directed networks is particularly challenging. Efficient algorithms to estimate voxel-wise centralities are still under development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Wink1">[59]</xref>, while computation of the intermediate directed connectivity matrix (∼10<sup>9</sup> elements) involves accuracy and efficiency problems. In the present work, we proposed a novel approach, PCGC<italic><sup>t</sup></italic>, to remove indirect interactions in large multivariate datasets.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4b">
<title>Partial Conditioning Technique</title>
<p>It has been recently proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Marinazzo1">[25]</xref> that partial conditioning on a small number of the most informative variables for the driver node is sufficient to obtain a reliable estimate of the directed connectivity, especially when the pattern of causalities is sparse. This approach not only allows a much faster calculation of Granger causality matrix, but also a more accurate one, where a fully multivariate approach would incur in curse of dimensionality and in underestimation of influences due to the presence of redundancy. Anatomical studies have shown that axonal connectivity of the cortex is generally sparse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Hagmann1">[53]</xref>, functional connectivity studies have been shown that the human brain is a highly clustered and redundancy complex system. Furthermore, the information gain plots reflect that the most informative variables for driver node were confined to small number of nodes or components. These evidences provide the idea to construct voxel-wise EC network by uses of partial conditioning technique.</p>
<p>In a recent study we have shown that the relative information gain (and thus the number of variables to condition on) is not affected by the time between successive scans (TR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Wu1">[26]</xref>, even though data with shorter TR contain more absolute information. Here we further examined how template size affects the information gain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Wu3">[60]</xref>. However, with lower scale template (such as AAL 512 and AAL 1024, and in general when the number of variables is larger than the number of samples), the residual redundancy will prevent a further decrease of the information gain after a local minimum. On the other hand, when <bold><italic>Z</italic></bold> is built from the aggregated signal according to community structure, this phenomenon disappears (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0073670.s005">Fig. S5</xref>).</p>
<p>The statistical analysis of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073670.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>provides the evidence that the most informative variables for the candidate driver mostly come from the community to which it belongs and are uniformly distributed within the rest of communities. This may give an additional explanation for the number of variables for which the curve of the information gain shows a knee, corresponding to the case in which relevant information is picked across all the communities. The joint information collected from the information gain curve, and the sensitivity and specificity of the greedy searching approach, one can choose the most convenient number of variables to include in the conditioning dataset. In the present study we set <italic>n<sub>d = </sub></italic>10.</p>
<p>PCGC<italic><sup>d</sup></italic> method is similar to LASSO based full-brain AR model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-ValdesSosa2">[61]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Tang1">[63]</xref>, only including a few variables to predict the other ones. Compared to PCGC<italic><sup>d</sup></italic>, PCGC<italic><sup>t</sup></italic> uses all the information from the conditional variables, and a proportional distribution of weight values for conditional variable in AR model are fixed a priori according to the community parcellation results.</p>

<title>Methodological Considerations and Limitations</title>
<p>On average 6.7 min/subject were required to complete a network, running on Windows 7 (64 bit), Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2400 CPU @ 3.10GHz, Installed memory (RAM): 16.0 GB.</p>
<p>In the simulated model, we did not consider the effect of time series length. We only chose a fixed value of the data length which ensured a robust significant causal inference. In addition, the simulated is not meant to reproduce complex brain activity, it is rather a controlled benchmark to be used for a proof of concept.</p>
<p>Community structure revealed by grouping the first 10 most informative contribution regions across all subjects at large scale parcellation (AAL-90) shows that there is a well distributed spatial organization of the set of conditioning variables <bold><italic>Z</italic></bold> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Wu2">[50]</xref>. Based on the above evidence, the distribution the variables in <bold><italic>Z</italic></bold> was further explored in the current study, and community organization derived from correlation matrix was reported as stable across three parcellations with increasing spatial resolution (AAL-90, AAL-512, AAL-1024), but it still remains to be validated how the performance of PCGC<italic><sup>t</sup></italic> is affected by inter- and intra-subject variability of the community structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0073670-Moussa1">[64]</xref>.</p>
<p>It is also worth to note that apart from directed connectivity, the problem of conditional dependencies affects as well correlation-based undirected (functional) connectivity, and a generalization of the approach proposed here to the latter case could be in order, and straightforward.</p>
<p>Here we reported the findings based on binary network, such as FCD. However, given that weighted networks contain information about connection strength that reflects heterogeneity in capacity and intensity of connections, these latter could be more indicated for brain connectome representation. For a cross-validation of our results, we additionally used Granger causality strength to identify brain hubs based on weighted effective connectivity network (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0073670.s004">Figs. S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0073670.s006">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0073670.s007">S7</xref>). These results are in accordance with the ones described in the main text.</p>
<p>Finally, for cross-validation of threshold selection, we used additional thresholds to evaluate the stability of the hubs organization in the effective networks (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0073670.s006">Figs. S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0073670.s007">S7</xref>), obtaining a general consistence across all the values.</p>
<p>To summarize, we proposed a an approach to perform partially conditioned Granger causality rooted in information theory and graph-theory analysis, coupled to a blind deconvolution technique based on point process analysis to reconstruct the voxel-wise effective connectome of the human brain. We put in evidence for the first time the voxel-wise hubs of incoming and outgoing information, as a complement to previous results on functional and anatomical connectomes. Analogies and differences with these networks have been presented and discussed. Our findings could open the way to a new description of global organization and information influence of brain function in terms of the Granger causality density.</p>
