<abstract>
<p>Coral reefs occupy a relatively small portion of sea area, yet serve as a crucial source of biodiversity by establishing harmonious ecosystems with marine plants and animals. Previous researches mainly focused on screening several key genes induced by stress. Here we proposed a novel method—correlation analysis after wavelet transform of complex network model, to explore the effect of light on gene expression in the coral <italic>Acropora millepora</italic> based on microarray data. In this method, wavelet transform and the conception of complex network were adopted, and 50 key genes with large differences were finally captured, including both annotated genes and novel genes without accurate annotation. These results shed light on our understanding of coral's response toward light changes and the genome-wide interaction among genes under the control of biorhythm, and hence help us to better protect the coral reef ecosystems. Further studies are needed to explore how functional connections are related to structural connections, and how connectivity arises from the interactions within and between different systems. The method introduced in this study for analyzing microarray data will allow researchers to explore genome-wide interaction network with their own dataset and understand the relevant biological processes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Coral reefs, by definition, are mainly three-dimensional shallow-water structures dominated by scleractinian corals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Bellwood1">[1]</xref>. Coral reefs occupy only a relatively small part of ocean acreages, yet harbor a considerably disproportionate amount of biodiversity, providing communities with ecosystem goods and services <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Pandolfi1">[2]</xref>. However, contemporary coral reefs constantly suffer from disease outbreak, overfishing, eutrophication, and ocean acidification. As a result, they increasingly fail to reassemble, leading to mass bleaching events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-HoeghGuldberg1">[3]</xref>, which marks the breakdown in the symbiosis with zooxanthellae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Lesser1">[4]</xref>. The elevated coral mortality and resilience failure have caused persistent shifts from the original coral dominance to algal preponderance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Bellwood1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Aronson1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Hughes1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>Numerous efforts have been made, not only by local residents but also by scientists, to achieve the overall goal of management of coral reefs, on which the human welfare depends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Moberg1">[7]</xref>. Accompanied by increasingly faster sequencing technology and lower cost, molecular level studies will be beneficial to coral reef conservation and management, such as barcoding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Neigel1">[8]</xref>, microarrays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Edge1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Levy1">[13]</xref> and comparative genomics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Schwarz1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Wang1">[15]</xref>. Levy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Levy1">[13]</xref> performed microarray analysis of coral genes with <italic>A</italic>. <italic>millepora</italic>, and indicated that many genes involved in stress responses and protection were coupled to the circadian clock. In their study, signals from time domain were transformed into frequency domain signals using the FFT (fast Fourier transform) method.</p>
<p>This study analyzed a published data set from Levy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Levy1">[13]</xref> with a novel method—correlation analysis after wavelet transform on complex network model, to explore the effect of light on gene expression in <italic>A. millepora</italic>. Wavelet transform, of which the time-frequency resolution depends on the signal frequency, can be used for multi-scale analysis of signal through dilation and translation, so it can effectively extract time–frequency features <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Peng1">[16]</xref>. At high frequencies, the wavelet reaches at high time resolution but low frequency resolution; whereas, at low frequencies, low time resolution and high frequency resolution can be obtained <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Daubechies1">[17]</xref>. By the advantage of multi-resolution, we can locate time and frequency more accurately. Firstly, dimension reduction was achieved by Euclidean distance clustering. Secondly, wavelet transform of 300 probes sampled through time axle was conducted. Finally, 50 key genes with large differences were screened, annotated and analyzed. In this way, we identified important genes including both previously-published genes with experiment support and novel genes without accurate annotation, which provides useful information for future research. Moreover, network characterization of gene connectivity under constant darkness shed light on our understanding of the coral's response toward light changes and an orchestrated correlation among genes under the control of biorhythm. Our method has shown advantages in dealing with extremely-complicated time serial data, which would be of wide use for similar data analyses.</p>

<title>Data generation</title>
<p>The data set used in this study was published by Levy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Levy1">[13]</xref>, available online in the NCBI database (GEO: GSE21658, Platform ID: GPL6941). The original aim of this data set was to better understand how corals tune their circadian machinery to respond to external and internal cues. According to the experimental conditions, 2 groups were divided as LD group (alternate light and dark) and DD group (continuous dark). Three coral colonies were sampled at 4 hr intervals during 2 consecutive days under an ambient LD cycle or under DD. A total of 72 arrays (GSM540430-GSM540501) were hybridized (n = 3) and the number of probes was 18432 in each array.</p>
<p>In our study, the average of 3 biological replicates' was used, obtaining a total of 24 groups of data. For each probe, there was a 12-dimensional vector composed of its gene expression data taken at 12 time points under the same experimental condition, populating original databases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092434.s002">Table S1</xref>). The number of records in original databases was reduced from 18432 to 17198 after deleting those with no corresponding genes (324) and averaging those multiple probes for a single gene. To avoid the immoderate impact of the differences on the model, each record was normalized to [−1, 1] using the following formulae:</p>
<p>If <italic>x</italic><sub>min</sub> ≠ <italic>x</italic><sub>max</sub>, then<disp-formula id="pone.0092434.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0092434.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>if <italic>x</italic><sub>min</sub>  =  <italic>x</italic><sub>max</sub>, then<disp-formula id="pone.0092434.e002"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0092434.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <italic>x</italic> and <italic>x′</italic> represent vector before and after normalization; <italic>x</italic><sub>min</sub> and <italic>x</italic><sub>max</sub> represent the minimum and maximum of the vectors' elements before normalization, respectively.

Here, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0092434.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was defined as the wavelet function.

<title>Correlation analysis in the frequency domain</title>
<p>A correlation analysis quantitatively analyzed the similarity and interdependence of 300 probes in the frequency domain between the two groups. The specific algorithm was as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Covariance of the frequency vectors <italic>X<sub>i</sub></italic> of probe <italic>i</italic> and <italic>X<sub>j</sub></italic> of probe <italic>j</italic>.<disp-formula id="pone.0092434.e012"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0092434.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>

<p>The correlation matrix <italic>R</italic> = (<italic>r<sub>ij</sub></italic>)<sub>300×300</sub> was thus obtained, which was a real symmetric matrix. We then defined the connectivity of a probe to measure the number of highly-relevant probes (0.7≤|<italic>r<sub>ij</sub></italic>|≤1). The connectivity of probe <italic>i</italic> was defined as the number of probes that were highly relevant to probe <italic>i</italic>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2e">
<title>The establishment of complex gene network</title>
<p>The connectivity of a probe (gene) to certain extent reflected its importance in the whole gene network, i.e., the larger the connectivity, the higher the importance. Through comparing the differences in connectivity between the 2 networks (LD and DD groups), we then identified those probes with remarkable changes in connectivity.</p>
<p>The algorithm to calculate the connectivity was as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Defining a connectivity matrix <italic>L</italic> = (<italic>l<sub>ij</sub></italic>)<sub>300×300</sub>, where <italic>l<sub>ij</sub></italic> represented the connectivity between probe <italic>i</italic> and probe <italic>j</italic>.</p>
<p>(2) In the matrix <italic>R</italic> = (<italic>r<sub>ij</sub></italic>)<sub>300×300</sub>, if 0.7≤|<italic>r<sub>ij</sub></italic>|≤1, then <italic>l<sub>ij</sub></italic> = 1; else, <italic>l<sub>ij</sub></italic> = 0.</p>
<p>(3) Ignoring autocorrelation, i.e., <italic>l<sub>ii</sub></italic> = 0.</p>
<p>(4) Calculating the connectivity <italic>l<sub>i</sub></italic> of probe <italic>i</italic>,<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0092434.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <italic>i</italic> = 1,…,300, where <italic>N</italic> = 300.</p>
<p>(5) The difference of the connectivity of probe <italic>i</italic> between LD and DD groups was obtained by subtracting the connectivity <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0092434.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the DD group from the connectivity <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0092434.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the LD group:<disp-formula id="pone.0092434.e017"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0092434.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>The detailed information about <italic>M</italic> is listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092434.s006">Table S5</xref>, and an example of calculating the connectivity (probe B015-C2) is illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092434.s001">Figure S1</xref>.</p>
<p>In this way, we discovered 168 probes whose connectivity was greater in the DD group than in the LD group, whereas there were 119 probes whose connectivity was greater in the LD group than in the DD group. The square ratio of negative or positive difference was defined as follows:<disp-formula id="pone.0092434.e018"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0092434.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>

In the same way, another inflection point (101, 10) was also identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092434-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092434.s007">Table S6</xref>, a total of 18 probes with large positive differences and 32 probes with large negative differences were selected from inflection points.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In this study, 18 probes with large positive differences and 32 probes with large negative differences were selected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092434.s007">Table S6</xref>). After gene annotation, we finally obtained 11 genes (61.11%) with large positive differences and 19 genes (59.38%) with large negative differences. The square ratio of negative differences (81.65%) was much larger than the square ratio of positive differences (18.35%), which can be explained by that more genes were upregulated coincidently in corals under LD cycles to maintain normal life activities; when under DD, the previous gene network was weakened, and the corresponding genes were suppressed for the life activities of the coral-algal symbiotic system.</p>
<p>Within the positive group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0092434-t001">Table 1</xref>), probes with fundamental functions were listed, with some believed to be house-keeping genes. Ubiquinone (DY582337) functions as a component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, while protein tyrosine phosphatase (DY584986) functions in a coordinated manner with protein tyrosine kinases to control signaling pathways. ATP synthase (DY584757) synthesizes cellular ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate, while seryl-tRNA synthetase (GO002856) belongs to the category of tRNA synthetase. Besides, actin (DY577937) and ubiquitin (DY582070) are usually regarded as reference genes, whose expressions remain stable under different conditions. Our results indicated that these key genes worked synchronically and formed a closer network to maintain homeostasis under an ambient LD cycle, whereas this network became looser and disordered under DD, which is partly in agreement with Levy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Levy1">[13]</xref> who suggested that coordinated chaperone expression probably reflected the diel pattern of stress experienced by symbiotic corals. In short, these genes formed a synchronous alliance in basal metabolism, keeping the whole organism functioning well under normal conditions.</p>
<p>For the negative group listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0092434-t002">Table 2</xref>, some genes are proven to be related to light response or cell cycle. DY584166 was previously annotated as heme binding protein 2, which was certified to be light-regulated gene in zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Weger1">[25]</xref>. DY582598, DY582400 and DY577894 were annotated as cyclin B2 or related proteins, which regulate the G2-M transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Gui1">[21]</xref>. With the absence of light in DD group, circadian clocks might be disturbed, resulting in adjustment of cell cycle, which was the case for plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Spudich1">[26]</xref>. Although such assumption lacks support from existing document and experiment, we believe that it is reasonable, because rhythm control may work as a whole, with related genes interacting with each other.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Some researchers believed that environmental stimuli could not result in so complex nonlinear dynamical systems such as heart rate and blood pressure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Goldberger1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Shono1">[28]</xref>. However, a growing body of evidences has shed light on the complicated nature of organism's reaction towards ecological stimuli—complex gene behavior, including upregulated or downregulated expression, and sometimes gene silencing. Due to the combinatorial complexity of gene interaction networks, it is difficult to identify key genes or coordinated gene pairs, and numerous investigative methods have been developed and used, e.g. weighted network analysis, hierarchical model-based analysis and nonlinear multivariate prediction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Kim1">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>However, few methods were applied in reef-building coral related researches. In the era of big data, data mining of complex gene network is crucial to understand complicated behavior of an organism. The thought of complex network has been widely used in brain connectivity studies and has been proven to be reliable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Deuker1">[30]</xref>, easily computable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-He1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Hagmann1">[32]</xref>, and useful for exploring structural–functional connectivity relationships <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Honey1">[33]</xref>. Here we intended to explore the effect of light on gene expression in <italic>A. millepora</italic> by correlation analysis after wavelet transform on complex network model. Euclidean distance clustering analysis and the ‘hard’ threshold strategy were used after normalization of the original data. During the whole process of data analysis, wavelet transform played a decisive role. Previously, wavelet transform was mainly applied in image coding, multisensor image fusion and texture classification. As there were no precedents in applying wavelet transform in microarray analysis, the present study for the first time used and proved this method to be effective and accurate in analysis of microarray data. Wavelet transform has advantage over other methods, for it providing an adjustable time-frequency window that can automatically narrow to improve the time resolution in the high-frequency region and broaden to improve the frequency resolution in the low-frequency region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Daubechies1">[17]</xref>; therefore, detailed signals with several closely-related genes and approximate signals with hundreds of genes were obtained. In this way, certain inconspicuous characters of genes can be made distinctive and captured. We tried direct data processing without wavelet transform and only obtained less than 10 key genes with significant differences (data not shown). Comparing with other studies, the present work showed a high efficiency, with 60% (30/50) obtained differentially-expressed genes successfully annotated. For example, only 22% of the 309 differentially-expressed genes identified using maanova method have annotations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Desalvo1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>A microarray is a complex biochemical-optical system whose purpose is to simultaneously measure the expression of thousands of genes, and thus can be regarded as a complex gene network. The topology of a microarray can be determined using different statistical or biological criteria. A few nodes can play a vital role in maintaining the network's connectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Albert1">[34]</xref>. When it comes to the gene network, these nodes (genes) may share the same co-expression pattern or cooperate tightly in cellular processes that lay a foundation for subsequent activities. It is thought that the growth of a network in which new nodes are preferentially attached to already established nodes may also be used to characterize the evolution of biological systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Barabsi1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092434-Albert2">[36]</xref>. Under DD, reef-building corals in this study tended to build a tighter gene network, as evidenced by probes with large negative differences. In other words, these genes were tightly correlated to fight against abnormal condition (i.e., DD).</p>
<p>Key genes are important but they often demonstrate distinctively different patterns of expression, which is hard to apply to overall management. Viewing the gene activities from the aspect of complex network, the present study provided a genome-scale overview of coral's response toward light changes and revealed an orchestrated collaboration among genes under the control of biorhythm. Network characterization of gene connectivity is useful not only for exploring gene co-expression, but also for revealing abnormality in physiological disorders. Therefore, the present data provide us a theoretical basis to better protect the coral reef ecosystems.</p>
<p>This network-scale analysis of coral microarray data demonstrates a possibility to investigate gene interaction in corals under different light conditions. A group of genes are screened, showing closer relationship in fighting against continuous darkness. These genes are the key nodes in gene network for coral activity towards light. Our next study will explore how functional connections are related to structural connections, how connectivity arises from interactions within and between different systems and the underlying principles. We believe that the method introduced in this study will be of wide use for researchers to further explore their own datasets and better understand the underlying biological mechanisms.</p>
