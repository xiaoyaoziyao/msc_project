        <p>Aging is characterized by the development of an endothelial dysfunction, which affects both the nitric oxide (NO)- and the endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF)-mediated relaxations, associated with vascular oxidative stress and the activation of the angiotensin system. This study investigated whether red wine polyphenols (RWPs), antioxidants and potent stimulators of NO- and EDHF-mediated relaxations improve aging-related endothelial dysfunction, and, if so, examined the underlying mechanism. Mesenteric artery reactivity was determined in organ chambers, vascular oxidative stress by dihydroethidine and MitoSOX staining, and expression of target proteins by immunohistochemical staining. Control young rats (16 weeks) received solvent (ethanol, 3% v/v), and middle-aged rats (46 weeks) either solvent or RWPs (100 mg/kg/day) in the drinking water. The acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent NO component was slightly reduced whereas the EDHF component was markedly blunted in rings of middle-aged rats compared to young rats. The endothelial dysfunction was associated with oxidative stress, an upregulation of angiotensin II and AT1 receptors and a down-regulation of SK<sub>Ca</sub>, IK<sub>Ca</sub>, and angiotensin converting enzyme. Intake of RWPs for either one or two weeks improved the NO and the EDHF components of the relaxation, and normalized oxidative stress, the expression of SK<sub>Ca</sub>, IK<sub>Ca</sub> and the components of the angiotensin system. The protective effect of the 2-week RWPs treatment persisted for one and two weeks following stopping intake of RWPs. Thus, intake of RWPs caused a persistent improvement of the endothelial function, particularly the EDHF component, in middle-aged rats and this effect seems to involve the normalization of the expression of SK<sub>Ca</sub>, IK<sub>Ca</sub> and the angiotensin system.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The endothelium is a key regulator of vascular homeostasis mostly through the release of several potent vasoactive factors that control vascular tone, blood fluidity, inflammation and smooth muscle cell proliferation. The endothelium-derived relaxing factors, which promote vascular protection, include nitric oxide (NO), prostacyclin, and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Feletou1">[1]</xref>. The importance of the EDHF phenomenon increases as the arterial diameter decreases and, hence, it has been suggested to play a significant role in the regulation of peripheral vascular resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Shimokawa1">[2]</xref>. In the mesenteric artery as well as in several other types of arteries, EDHF-mediated responses involve the activation of endothelial SK<sub>Ca</sub> and IK<sub>Ca</sub> channels (small and intermediate conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels, respectively) inducing hyperpolarization of the endothelium which is thereafter transmitted, in part, to the underlying vascular smooth cells via myo-endothelial gap junctions with subsequent relaxation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Edwards1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Vascular aging is associated with the development of an endothelial dysfunction, which may contribute to the initiation and development of major cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and hypertension. Aging-related endothelial dysfunction has been described in different vascular beds including the human brachial artery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Celermajer1">[4]</xref>, the rat aorta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Kung1">[5]</xref>, the rat carotid artery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Hongo1">[6]</xref> and the rat perfused mesenteric bed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Atkinson1">[7]</xref>. The aging-related endothelial dysfunction often involves a decreased NO- <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Matz1">[8]</xref> and EDHF-mediated relaxations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Goto1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Kansui1">[10]</xref>, and also, in some blood vessels, the development of endothelium-dependent contractile responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Wong1">[11]</xref>. It is associated also with an excessive vascular formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), in particular superoxide anions, which, in turn, can inactivate NO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Hamilton1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Taddei1">[13]</xref>. Potential sources of ROS in old arteries include NADPH oxidase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Hamilton1">[12]</xref>, mitochondrial respiration chain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-vanderLoo1">[14]</xref>, xanthine oxidase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Aranda1">[15]</xref>, and uncoupled endothelial NO synthase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Cosentino1">[16]</xref>. Although the mechanism underlying the aging-related oxidative stress is unclear, recent evidence suggests a role for the angiotensin system. Indeed, both an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and an AT1 receptor antagonist have been shown to prevent the aging-related endothelial dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Kansui1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Goto2">[17]</xref>. In addition, angiotensin II, which is a potent inducer of vascular oxidative stress via the AT1 receptor-dependent upregulation of NADPH oxidase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Sarr1">[18]</xref>, has also been shown to induce a severe inhibition of EDHF-mediated relaxations in the mesenteric artery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-DalRos1">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Numerous vascular reactivity studies indicate that several polyphenol-rich sources such as red wine polyphenols and green tea catechins are potent inducers of both NO- and EDHF-mediated endothelium-dependent relaxations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Ndiaye1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Ndiaye2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Lorenz1">[22]</xref>. In addition, chronic intake of red wine polyphenols improved the angiotensin II-induced hypertension and endothelial dysfunction in rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Sarr1">[18]</xref>. The beneficial effect of red wine polyphenols involves their ability to prevent vascular oxidative stress, in part, by reducing the expression of NADPH oxidase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Sarr1">[18]</xref>. Moreover, chronic intake of red wine polyphenols by young rats prevented aging-related endothelial dysfunction in the mesenteric artery and decline in physical performance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-DalRos2">[23]</xref>. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine whether established aging-related endothelial dysfunction can also be improved by the intake of red wine polyphenols, and, if so, to determine the time-course of the induction of the vascular protective effect and its removal after stopping intake of red wine polyphenols, as well as the role of oxidative stress and the angiotensin system.</p>

        <p>In mesenteric artery rings with endothelium, acetylcholine-induced NO-mediated relaxations (determined in the presence of indomethacin, and charybdotoxin plus apamin to prevent the formation of vasoactive prostanoids and EDHF, respectively) were slightly but significantly reduced in mature-adult (25-week old) and middle-aged (46-week old) rats compared to young (16-week old) rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032039-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). In addition, acetylcholine-induced EDHF-mediated relaxations (determined in the presence of indomethacin and L-NA to prevent the formation of vasoactive prostanoids and NO, respectively) were reduced significantly to some extent in mature-adult rats and markedly blunted in middle-aged rats in comparison to young rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032039-g001">Figure 1b</xref>). In contrast, relaxations in mesenteric artery rings without endothelium to the exogenous donor of NO, sodium nitroprusside (EC<sub>50</sub> were 3.0±0.5 nM, 1.8±0.9 nM, 2.5±0.9 nM for 16, 25 and 46-week old rats, respectively; n = 5–6) and the ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channel opener, levcromakalim (EC<sub>50</sub> were 118.3±35.4 nM, 274.2±95.2 nM, 154.9±52.7 nM for 16-, 25- and 46 week-old rats, respectively; n = 5–6) were similar in the three groups of age.</p>

        <title>Persistent protective effect of the RWPs treatment on NO- and EDHF-mediated relaxations in middle-aged rats</title>
        <p>In order to determine whether the protective effect of a 14-day treatment of middle-aged rats with RWPs (100 mg/kg/day) on the endothelial function persists after stopping their intake, rats were treated with RWPs for 14 days followed by a 7- or 14-day intake of solvent and then the reactivity of the mesenteric artery was determined. Intake of RWPs for either 21 or 28 days was associated with a slight but significant improvement of the acetylcholine-induced NO-mediated relaxation and a marked improvement of the EDHF-mediated relaxation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032039-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The protective effect of the 14-day RWPs treatment on the NO component was also observed one but not two weeks after stopping the intake of RWPs whereas that on the EDHF component persisted thereafter for two weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032039-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, these data indicate that the protective effect of the RWPs treatment on the endothelial function is a sustained event, which persists, at least, two weeks after stopping their intake.</p>

        <p>In order to determine the nature and source of ROS, mesenteric artery sections from middle-aged rats were treated with different inhibitors before DHE staining. The DHE fluorescence signal in mesenteric artery sections of 46-week old rats was markedly reduced by membrane-permeant analogues of superoxide dismutase (MnTMPyP) and catalase (PEG-catalase) indicating the involvement of both superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032039-g005">Figure 5b</xref>). In addition, the increased DHE fluorescence signal was also markedly reduced by apocynin (a NADPH oxidase inhibitor), L-NA (an endothelial NO synthase inhibitor), sulfaphenazol (a cytochrome P450 inhibitor), indomethacin (a cyclooxygenase inhibitor) and by a combination of inhibitors of the mitochondrial respiration chain (KCN, myxothiazol, and rotenone) indicating the involvement of NADPH oxidase, uncoupled eNOS, cytochrome P450, cyclooxygenases and the mitochondrial respiration chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032039-g005">Figure 5b</xref>). In addition, the level of oxidative stress in the mesenteric artery was also assessed by nitrotyrosine staining, an indicator of the formation of peroxynitrites. As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032039-g005">Figure 5a</xref>, an increased signal was observed in the mesenteric artery of middle-aged rats compared to young rats, an effect which was prevented by the RWPs treatment for either 2 or 4 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032039-g005">Figure 5a</xref>). Moreover, the level of mitochondrial oxidative stress was assessed using the redox-sensitive dye MitoSOX.

        <p>Since the characterization of the enzymatic sources of ROS in the mesenteric artery of middle-aged rats has indicated the involvement of NADPH oxidase and cyclooxygenases, their expression level was determined by immunohistochemical staining.

In contrast, the COX-1 signal was similar in all groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032039-g005">Figure 5a</xref>), and that of COX-2 was barely detectable (data not shown).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The major findings of the present study indicate that established aging-related blunted endothelium-dependent NO- and EDHF-mediated relaxations are improved by oral intake of RWPs; such an effect is observed already 7 days after intake of RWPs and is maintained when the RWPs intake period is extended up to 28 days. Moreover, the beneficial effect of a 14-day intake of RWPs on EDHF and NO components is still observed 7 and/or 14 days after stopping intake of RWPs indicating that the protective effect of RWPs on aging-related endothelial dysfunction is a sustained event. The present findings further indicate that aging is associated with an increased vascular formation of ROS, in particular superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide, which appears to involve several sources including NADPH oxidase, uncoupled eNOS, cytochrome P450, cyclooxygenases and the mitochondrial respiration chain. Vascular aging is also associated with an increased activation of the angiotensin system as indicated by enhanced immunohistochemical staining of angiotensin II and AT1 receptors in the arterial wall. Since angiotensin II is a strong activator of vascular oxidative stress via AT1 receptor and an inducer of endothelial dysfunction, it is likely that the protective effect of the RWPs treatment on aging-related endothelial dysfunction is due, at least in part, to its ability to normalize the expression of angiotensin II and AT1 receptors in the mesenteric arterial wall of middle-aged rats.</p>
      <p>The study of the endothelial function in the mesenteric artery as a function of aging has indicated a major impairment of the EDHF component and also, to some extent, the NO component. Aging-related blunted NO-mediated relaxations have also been observed in the second and the third branch of the superior mesenteric artery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Matz1">[8]</xref>, the aorta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-vanderLoo1">[14]</xref>, the carotid artery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Hongo1">[6]</xref>, the coronary arterioles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Csiszar1">[25]</xref> and the perfused kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Long1">[26]</xref> in the rat. In aging, an impairment of EDHF-mediated relaxations has been observed in the superior mesenteric artery and the perfused kidney of rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Goto1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-DalRos2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Long1">[26]</xref>, and the human gastroepiploic distal artery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-UrakamiHarasawa1">[27]</xref>. Although the aging-related endothelial dysfunction has been consistently observed, great variations in the extent of the impairment of the NO and/or the EDHF components have been reported and have been attributed to the use of different rat strains, arterial types and the difference of age of the old rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Kung1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Hongo1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Matz1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Goto1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Kansui1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Goto2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Long1">[26]</xref>. In addition, we have observed a pronounced impairment of the NO component in the rat mesenteric artery of 40-week old Wistar rats in a previous study whereas only a small impairment was observed in the mesenteric artery of 46-week old Wistar rats in the present study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-DalRos2">[23]</xref>. Although surprising such a difference may be due to the fact that the former rats were from our inbred strain whereas the latter ones were bought from a commercial supplier.</p>
      <p>The present findings indicate that intake of RWPs (100 mg/kg/day) improved both NO- and EDHF-mediated relaxations in the mesenteric artery of middle-aged rats and that this effect is observed already after a 7-day treatment period and persisted up to a 28-day treatment period. The dose of 100 mg/kg/day RWPs corresponds to a human equivalent dose of ∼1000 mg/day <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-ReaganShaw1">[28]</xref>. Our previous study has also indicated that chronic intake of low doses of RWPs (25 or 75 mg/kg/day) by 16 week-old young rats for 24 weeks is associated with improved NO and EDHF-mediated relaxations in the rat mesenteric artery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-DalRos2">[23]</xref>. Thus, RWPs appear to be able to retard the development of an endothelial dysfunction and to improve an established endothelial dysfunction affecting both NO and EDHF related to aging. Since the improvement of the NO component was still observed one week after stopping intake of RWPs and that of the EDHF component persisted up to 2 weeks in middle-aged rats, the beneficial effect of RWPs on the endothelial function appears to be a long lasting event, most likely, due to their ability to accumulate into tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Kawai1">[29]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The aging-related impairment of the EDHF component seems to be mostly due to a reduced expression of SK<sub>Ca</sub> and IK<sub>Ca</sub> channels, which mediate EDHF-dependent hyperpolarization and relaxation in the rat mesenteric artery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Edwards1">[3]</xref>. A reduced expression level of SK<sub>Ca</sub> and IK<sub>Ca</sub> associated to blunted EDHF-mediated relaxations has also been observed in the rat mesenteric artery following angiotensin II-induced hypertension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Hilgers1">[30]</xref> or common bile duct ligation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-DalRos3">[24]</xref>, and in the rat cavernous tissue following streptozotocin-induced diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Zhu1">[31]</xref>. The present findings suggest that the beneficial effect of the RWPs treatment on the EDHF component might be due, at least in part, to their ability to restore the expression of SK<sub>Ca</sub> and IK<sub>Ca</sub> to a level similar to that observed in young adults. The RWPs treatment also increased the reduced eNOS fluorescence signal in the mesenteric artery of middle-aged rats; such an effect might contribute to explain the improved NO-mediated relaxation. Lower levels of eNOS expression in old blood vessels have also been observed previously in some studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Csiszar1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Wu1">[32]</xref> whereas others reported an increased eNOS expression level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Matz1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-vanderLoo1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-DalRos2">[23]</xref>. Such a heterogeneous effect might be related to the use of different types of arteries, the difference of age of the old rats, and possibly also to the fact that aged rats were from different suppliers.</p>
      <p>Several studies have indicated that vascular oxidative stress plays a major role in aging-related endothelial dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-vanderLoo1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Csiszar1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Oudot1">[33]</xref>. Indeed, an increased level of superoxide anions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-vanderLoo1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Csiszar1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Oudot1">[33]</xref>, and also hydrogen peroxide as shown in the present study, is observed in the aged arterial wall. Moreover, several sources of reactive oxygen species have been involved and, in particular, NADPH oxidase in the rat aorta and mesenteric artery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Oudot1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Briones1">[34]</xref>, xanthine oxidase in the rat aorta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Newaz1">[35]</xref>, cyclooxygenase-2 in pig pial arteries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Armstead1">[36]</xref>, and uncoupled endothelial NO synthase in the mouse mesenteric artery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Yang1">[37]</xref>. The present findings suggest that, besides NADPH oxidase, cyclooxygenases, and uncoupled endothelial NO synthase, cytochrome P450 monoxygenases and the mitochondrial respiration chain contribute also to the increased oxidative stress in the mesenteric artery of middle-aged rats. Superoxide anions are known to reduce the bioavailability of NO both by reacting with NO to form peroxynitrite and by oxidizing tetrahydrobiopterin, an essential co-factor of NO synthase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Chen1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Schmidt1">[39]</xref>. Moreover, the beneficial effect of the RWPs treatment on aging-related endothelial dysfunction appears to involve their ability to prevent the excessive oxidative stress in the aged arterial wall. The antioxidant effect may due to their ability to directly interact with superoxide anions and other reactive oxygen species such as hydroxy and peroxy radicals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Frankel1">[40]</xref>. It may also be due to their ability to prevent the aging-related upregulation of the NADPH oxidase subunits nox1 and p22phox, and to improve the mitochondrial formation of ROS as shown in the present study. Previous studies have also shown that RWPs prevent the expression of NADPH oxidase in the aorta subsequently to the infusion of a hypertensive dose of angiotensin II to rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Sarr1">[18]</xref>. Moreover, tea polyphenols prevented the expression of NADPH oxidase and up-regulated that of catalase in vascular cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Negishi1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Ying1">[42]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although the mechanism underlying the aging-related oxidative stress-mediated endothelial dysfunction remains to be determined, several lines of evidence support a role for the angiotensin system. Indeed, angiotensin II is a potent inducer of endothelial dysfunction and vascular oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-DalRos1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Rajagopalan1">[43]</xref>. Moreover, treatment of rats with either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an AT1 receptor antagonist effectively ameliorated endothelial dysfunction, both the NO component and the EDHF component, in aged blood vessels, in part, by decreasing vascular oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Atkinson1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Goto1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Kansui1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Mukai1">[44]</xref>. Moreover, in old AT1-receptor deficient mice, endothelium-dependent relaxations in the basilar artery were normal whereas those in wild-type mice were reduced by about 50% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Modrick1">[45]</xref>. The present findings also support a role for the angiotensin system in the aging-related endothelial dysfunction since aging was associated with an increased expression level of angiotensin II and AT1 receptors. In addition, aging was also associated with reduced expression of AT2 receptors, which have been shown to stimulate the endothelial formation of NO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Lemarie1">[46]</xref>. Although the source of angiotensin II remains to be clarified, it does not seem to involve the angiotensin-converting enzyme since its expression level appears to be down-regulated in the mesenteric artery of middle-aged rats. The possibility that the local angiotensin system contributes to the increased expression level of angiotensin II in aged blood vessels still remains to be studied. Such a possibility might involve chymases, which have been shown to mediate the high glucose-induced formation of angiotensin II in rat vascular smooth muscle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Lavrentyev1">[47]</xref>. The present findings indicate that the intake of RWPs is able to normalize the expression level of angiotensin II, AT1 receptors, AT2 receptors and angiotensin-converting enzyme in the mesenteric artery of aged rats to a level similar to that observed in young rats. In addition, intake of RWPs by rats starting at week 16 until week 40 prevented also the expression of AT1 receptors in the mesenteric artery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-DalRos2">[23]</xref>. The increased formation of angiotensin II in aged blood vessels most likely contributes, besides oxidative stress, to the down-regulation of SK<sub>Ca</sub> and IK<sub>Ca</sub> since a reduced expression level of both channels is observed in the rat mesenteric artery during angiotensin II-induced hypertension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Hilgers1">[30]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, aging is associated with the development of an endothelial dysfunction in the rat mesenteric artery, which affects markedly the EDHF component and also, to some extent, the NO component. Intake of RWPs in the drinking water improves the established aging-related endothelial dysfunction most likely by normalizing the local activation of the angiotensin system and preventing the oxidative stress-mediated impairment of both the NO and the EDHF components.</p>

        <p>The main superior mesenteric artery was cleaned of connective tissue and cut into rings (2–3 mm in length). This type of blood vessel has been selected due to the fact that endothelium-dependent relaxations involve both NO and EDHF as in human coronary arteries, which are the major site for the development of cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Nakashima1">[48]</xref>. In some preparations, the endothelium was removed by rubbing the intimal surface of rings with a pair of forceps. Rings were suspended in organ baths containing oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) Krebs bicarbonate solution (mM: NaCl 119, KCl 4.7, KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.18, MgSO<sub>4</sub> 1.18, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.25, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 25 and d-glucose 11, pH 7.4, 37°C) for the determination of changes in isometric tension. The rings were stretched step by step until an optimal resting tension of 1 g was reached and then allowed to equilibrate for at least 60 min. After the equilibration period, the rings were exposed to Krebs bicarbonate solution containing a high concentration of potassium (80 mM) until reproducible contractile responses were obtained. After washing with Krebs bicarbonate solution, the rings were precontracted with phenylephrine (PE, 1 µM) to about 80% of the maximal contraction by high K<sup>+</sup> solution before addition of acetylcholine (ACh, 1 µM) to check the presence of a functional endothelium. After washout and a further 30-min equilibration period, rings were again contracted with PE before the application of increasing concentrations of either ACh, sodium nitroprusside (an exogenous NO donor) or levcromakalim (an ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channel opener) to construct concentration-response curves. Sodium nitroprusside- and levcromakalim-induced relaxations were examined in endothelium-denuded rings of mesenteric artery. In some experiments, rings were exposed to an inhibitor for 30 min before contraction with PE. The NO-mediated component of relaxation was determined in the presence of indomethacin (10 µM) and charybdotoxin (CTX, 100 nM) plus apamin (APA, 100 nM) to inhibit the participation of prostanoids and EDHF, respectively. The EDHF-mediated component of relaxation was determined in the presence of indomethacin (10 µM) and N<sup>ω</sup>-nitro-L-arginine (L-NA, 300 µM) to inhibit the formation of prostanoids and NO, respectively. Relaxations were expressed as percentage of the contraction induced by PE.</p>

        <title>Immunohistochemical determination of target proteins in the mesenteric arterial wall</title>
        <p>Segments of the main mesenteric artery were removed, embedded in OCT compound (Tissue-Tek, Sakura Finetek) and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen arteries were cryosectionned at 14 µm. Sections were air-dried for 15 min and stored at −80°C until use. Sections were first fixed with paraformaldehyde at 4%, washed and treated with 10% milk or 5% goat serum in PBS containing 0.1% Triton ×100 for 1 h at room temperature to block non-specific binding. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4°C with an antibody directed against either eNOS (1/100), calcium-dependent potassium channels (SK<sub>Ca</sub>, IK<sub>Ca</sub>, 1/200), angiotensin II (1/500), AT1 receptor (1/400), AT2 receptor (1/400), angiotensin-converting enzyme (1/200), nitrotyrosine (1/200), nox1 (1/200), p22phox (1/200), cyclooxygenase-1 or -2 (1/200), and nitrotyrosine (1/100)<monospace>.</monospace> Sections were then washed with PBS, incubated with the secondary antibody (Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or Alexa 637-conjugated goat anti-rabbit) diluted (1/400) in the same buffer for 2 h at room temperature in the dark, and washed before being mounted in Vectashield (mounting medium for fluorescence, Vector Laboratories, Inc. Burlingame, CA 94010) and cover-slipped. For negative controls, primary antibodies were omitted. The samples were observed using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica SP2 UV DM IRBE) with 40× magnification lens. Quantification of proteins levels was performed using Image J 1,4 2q software (National Institutes of Health, USA).</p>

        <title>Determination of vascular and mitochondrial ROS formation</title>
        <p>The redox-sensitive fluorescent dye dihydroethidine was used to evaluate <italic>in situ</italic> formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following the method previously described by Sarr <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032039-Sarr1">[18]</xref>. Mesenteric arterial rings (3 to 4 mm length) were embedded in OCT compound (Tissue-Tek), and frozen in a nitrogen bath for cryostat sections. Dihydroethidine (2.5 µM, Sigma) was applied onto 25 µm unfixed cryosections of mesenteric arteries for 30 min at 37°C in a light-protected humidified chamber to determine the <italic>in situ</italic> ROS formation. To determine the nature and the source of ROS, sections were incubated with either MnTMPyP (membrane-permeant superoxide dismutase mimetic, 100 µM), polyethylene glycol-catalase (membrane-permeant catalase, 500 UI/ml), L-NA (NO synthase inhibitor, 300 µM), apocynin (NADPH oxidase inhibitor, 300 µM), sulfaphenazol (cytochrome P450 inhibitor, 100 µM), indomethacin (cyclooxygenase inhibitor, 10 µM) or inhibitors of the mitochondrial respiration chain (myxothiazol, 0.5 µM+rotenone, 1 µM+KCN, 1 µM) for 30 min at 37°C before addition of dihydroethidine. MitoSox (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), a mitochondrion-specific hydroethidine-derivative fluorescent dye, was used to assess mitochondrial ROS <italic>in situ</italic>. Briefly, 14 µm unfixed cryosections of mesenteric arteries were incubated with MitoSox (5 µM at 37°C for 60 min) in a light-protected humidified chamber. Sections were then washed three times, mounted in Vectashield and cover-slipped. Images were obtained with a Leica SP2 UV DM IRBE laser scanning confocal microscope. Quantification of staining levels was performed using Image J 1,42q software.</p>
