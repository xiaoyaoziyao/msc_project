<title>Aim</title>
<p>The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)<italic>alpha</italic> and PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> by Bezafibrate (BZ) could attenuate hepatic and white adipose tissue (WAT) abnormalities in male offspring from diet-induced obese dams.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>C57BL/6 female mice were fed a standard chow (SC; 10% lipids) diet or a high-fat (HF; 49% lipids) diet for 8 weeks before mating and during gestation and lactation periods. Male offspring received SC diet at weaning and were subdivided into four groups: SC, SC/BZ, HF and HF/BZ. Treatment with BZ (100 mg/Kg diet) started at 12 weeks of age and was maintained for three weeks.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>The HF diet resulted in an overweight phenotype and an increase in oral glucose intolerance and fasting glucose of dams. The HF offspring showed increased body mass, higher levels of plasmatic and hepatic triglycerides, higher levels of pro-inflammatory and lower levels of anti-inflammatory adipokines, impairment of glucose metabolism, abnormal fat pad mass distribution, higher number of larger adipocytes, hepatic steatosis, higher expression of lipogenic proteins concomitant to decreased expression of PPAR<italic>alpha</italic> and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-1) in liver, and diminished expression of PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> and adiponectin in WAT. Treatment with BZ ameliorated the hepatic and WAT abnormalities generated by diet-induced maternal obesity, with improvements observed in the structural, biochemical and molecular characteristics of the animals' livers and epididymal fat.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Diet-induced maternal obesity lead to alterations in metabolism, hepatic lipotoxicity and adverse liver and WAT remodeling in the offspring. Targeting PPAR with Bezafibrate has beneficial effects reducing the alterations, mainly through reduction of WAT inflammatory state through PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> activation and enhanced hepatic <italic>beta</italic>-oxidation due to increased PPAR<italic>alpha</italic>/PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> ratio in liver.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Obesity and comorbidities (metabolic syndrome, MS, leading to type 2 diabetes mellitus, DM2, cardiovascular disease, CVD, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, NAFLD) is due not only to environmental factors but also to maternal nutrition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Howie1">[1]</xref>. According to the Developmental Overnutrition Hypothesis, maternal overnutrition leads to permanent alterations in appetite control, neuroendocrine behavior and/or energetic metabolism in offspring during development, leading to obesity in adulthood even in the absence of excessive energy intake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Drake1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Gregorio1">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>WAT is able to express and secrete several cytokines called adipokines, such as leptin, adiponectin and resistin, and has a role in the secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-<italic>alpha</italic>, interleukin (IL)-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Gustafson1">[4]</xref>. Obesity and its outcomes are closely linked to an increase in both visceral WAT and adipocyte size, highly affecting the function of this organ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-CattaPreta1">[5]</xref>. Visceral fat accumulation is a cornerstone for the development of obesity-related pathologies, such as NAFLD, in contrast with subcutaneous WAT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Fox1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Pou1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>NAFLD is the hepatic component of MS and is associated with obesity, insulin resistance (IR) and DM2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Eckel1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Aguila1">[9]</xref>. As the condition progresses, NAFLD evolves to non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) because of continuous inflammation and the peroxidation of lipids. NASH can progress to cirrhosis through hepatic fibrosis and advance to hepatocarcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Brunt1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Festi1">[11]</xref>. In addition, maternal diet during gestation and lactation can induce IR and NAFLD in offspring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Gregorio1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-SouzaMello1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are a family of transcription factors (TFs) existing in three isoforms: PPAR<italic>alpha</italic>, PPAR<italic>beta</italic> and PPAR<italic>gamma</italic>. They are closely linked to carbohydrate, protein, and lipid metabolism as well as to cellular proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Christodoulides1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Takahashi1">[14]</xref>. BZ is often used in clinical practice as a hypolipidemic drug. It was reported as a pan-PPAR agonist activating all three isoforms, but it preferentially activates PPAR<italic>alpha</italic> and PPAR<italic>beta</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Peters1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Tenenbaum1">[16]</xref>. BZ has been demonstrated to prevent DM2 both in patients with CVD and in patients having undergone heart attack <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Tenenbaum2">[17]</xref>. Furthermore, it has been shown to result in improvement of NASH in an animal model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Nagasawa1">[18]</xref>. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to evaluate whether Bezafibrate could attenuate alterations in the livers and WAT of male mice offspring from diet-induced obese dams.</p>

<title>Animals and diet</title>
<p>This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication number 85-23, revised 1996). The protocol was approved by Ethics Committee for Animal Experimentation of the State University of Rio de Janeiro (Protocol Number CEUA/012/2011). All efforts were made to minimize suffering.</p>
<p>Animals were maintained under controlled conditions (20±2°C, humidity 60±10% and 12 h/12 h dark/light cycle) and had free access to food and water. Four-week-old females were randomly divided into two nutritional groups (n = 10), standard-chow (SC; 10% of energy from lipids) or high-fat diet (HF; 49% of energy from lipids), and were fed these diets for 8 weeks. Food intake of dams was measured by Compulse v 2.7.13 (Harvard/Panlab, Barcelona, Spain) two weeks before mating, and body mass (BM) was measured weekly. At 12 weeks old, females were mated with breeding males, and during gestation and lactation, the females continued receiving the same diets. Dams received experimental diets during 8 weeks pre-mating in order to assure that they were overweighed at the time of conception. At weaning, male offspring were subdivided into four groups (n = 10), to include BZ treatment: SC, SC/BZ, HF, and HF/BZ (according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064258-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Treatment with BZ started at 12 weeks of age and was maintained for three weeks. Food intake of offspring was measured by Compulse two weeks before sacrifice, and body mass (BM) was measured weekly. Offspring from HF and SC dams were weaned onto the same diet, SC diet. Therefore, metabolic abnormalities observed in HF offspring could be attributed to diet-induced maternal obesity as animals received balanced diet at post-weaning period. All diets were supplemented with purified nutrients by PragSolucoes (Jau, Sao Paulo, Brazil) and were in accordance with the American Institute of Nutrition's recommendations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0064258-t001">Table 1</xref>). BZ (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, Mo., USA) was added to the diets at the dose of 100 mg/kg, which is a murine dose that can be compared to the clinical human dose of 10 mg/kg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-ReaganShaw1">[19]</xref>.</p>

<title>Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)</title>
<p>OGTT was performed at one week before mating in dams, and at the end of treatment in offspring. Mice were fasted for 6 h before glucose administration. Glucose (1 g/kg) was given orally at time 0; tail blood was collected at fasting (i.e., baseline) and then at 15, 30, 60 and 120 min after glucose loading for glucose determination (Glucometer Accu-Chek, Roche, SP, Brazil). The area under the curve (AUC; millimolar per minute) was calculated. The values of glucose concentration at time 0 were used to determine the fasting glycemia.</p>

<title>Sacrifice and tissue extraction</title>
<p>Before sacrifice, animals were deprived of food for 6 h and then deeply anaesthetized (150 mg/kg of sodium pentobarbital, intraperitoneally). Blood samples were rapidly obtained by cardiac puncture, and plasma was separated by centrifugation (120× g for 20 min) at room temperature and stored individually at −20°C until assay. Both the liver and the fat pads (inguinal, retroperitoneal and epididymal fat pads) were carefully dissected, weighed and prepared for analysis. Portions of the liver and the epididymal fat pad were kept in a freshly prepared fixative solution (formaldehyde 4% w/v, 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.2) during 48 h and prepared to microscopy. Additional portions of the liver and epididymal fat pad were rapidly frozen for molecular analysis by immunoblotting and RT-qPCR. Remaining liver was prepared for biochemical analysis, and the adiposity index calculated and determined as the ratio between the sum of the masses of all fat pads divided by the total body mass, represented as a percentage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-BarbosadaSilva1">[20]</xref>.</p>

The homogenate was centrifuged at 2000 g, and 5 µl of the supernatant was used to measure TAG with a kit and an automated spectrophotometer (Bioclin System II, Quibasa Ltda., Belo Horizonte, Brazil) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-CattaPreta2">[23]</xref>.</p>

<title>Immunoblotting</title>
<p>For liver and WAT analyses, total proteins were extracted in homogenizing buffer with protease inhibitors. Next, the homogenates were centrifuged at 4°C, and the supernatants were collected. Equal quantities of total protein were resuspended in SDS-containing sample buffer, heated for 5 min at 100°C and separated by SDS/PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electroblotted onto a polyvinyldifluoride transfer membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J., USA). The efficiency of the transfer was visualized by Ponceau solution staining. The membrane was blocked by incubation with non-fat dry milk. Antibodies against sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), PPAR<italic>alpha</italic>, PPAR<italic>gamma</italic>, adiponectin, glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and <italic>beta</italic>-actin were purchased from Santa Cruz. Hepatic and WAT homogenates were incubated with various polyclonal antibodies (as specified in the results section). <italic>Beta</italic>-actin served as a loading control for proteins.</p>
<p>All protein expression was detected using an ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) detection system (Amersham Bioscience). Signals were visualized by autoradiography and determined by quantitative analysis of digital images of gels using ImageJ software, version 1.44 (NIH, imagej.nih.gov/ij, USA). The integral absorbance values were measured.</p>

<title>Liver RT-qPCR</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from approximately 50 mg of liver tissue using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA). RNA amount was determined using Nanovue (GE Life Sciences) spectroscopy, and 1 µg of RNA was treated with DNAse I (Invitrogen). Synthesis of the first strand cDNA was performed using Oligo (dT) primers for mRNA and Superscript III reverse-transcriptase (both Invitrogen). Quantitative real time PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed using a Biorad CFX96 cycler and the SYBR Green mix (Invitrogen). Primers for qPCR were designed using the Primer3 online software and are indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0064258-t002">Table 2</xref>. Endogenous control TBP (TATA Box binding-protein) was used to normalize the expression of the selected genes. Efficiencies of RT-qPCR for the target gene and the endogenous control were approximately equal, and were calculated through dilution series of cDNA. Real Time PCR reactions were conducted as follows: after a pre-denaturation and polymerase-activation program (4 min at 95°C), forty-four cycles, each one consisting of 95°C for 10 s and 60°C for 15 s were followed by a melting curve program (60 to 95°C with heating rate of 0.1°C/s). Negative controls consisted of wells in which cDNA was substituted for deionized water. The relative expression ratio (RQ) of mRNA was calculated by the equation 2<sup>−ΔΔCt</sup>, in which −ΔCT expresses the difference between number of cycles (CT) of the target genes and the endogenous control.</p>

<p>The presence of liver steatosis was confirmed in the HF group, and its improvement was shown in the HF/BZ group using stereological quantification.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Diet-induced obesity in dams during pre-mating, gestation and lactation periods produced offspring with noticeable BM gain, high levels of plasma and hepatic TGs, high levels of pro-inflammatory and low levels of anti-inflammatory adipokines, impairment of glucose metabolism, abnormal fat pad mass distribution, higher numbers of larger adipocytes, hepatic steatosis, high mRNA expression of lipogenic proteins and its target genes concomitant to decreased expression of PPAR<italic>alpha</italic> and CPT-1 in liver, and diminished expression of PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> and adiponectin in WAT. All these findings could be accounted for by diet-induced maternal obesity once all offspring received a balanced diet at weaning instead of the same diet as their mothers.</p>
<p>Treatment with BZ ameliorated the hepatic defects generated by maternal obesity as well as WAT remodeling, with improvement in the structural, biochemical and molecular characteristics of the animals' livers and epididymal WAT. These benefits can be attributed to drug administration and the negative energy balance observed in treated animals since such improvements were not exhibited by animals exposed to diet-induced maternal obesity without being treated.</p>
<p>HF offspring had hyperphagia, an expected behavior accounted for by hypotalamic modifications owing to excessive maternal energy intake, leading to obesity in adulthood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Samuelsson1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Sullivan1">[26]</xref>. BZ yielded negative energetic balance with decreased food intake in both treated offspring groups and this observation agrees with the reduced body mass observed in treated offspring compared to their counterparts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-FernandesSantos1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>Diet-induced maternal obesity triggers increased non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), triglycerides, glucose and inflammatory cytokine influx to the fetus, which provoke dyslipidemia and glucose intolerance in the HF offspring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Gregorio1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Sullivan1">[26]</xref>. Moreover, the HF offspring also showed higher levels of plasma insulin and leptin than the SC offspring. Increased adiposity index correlates with elevated circulating levels of leptin, which in the pancreas act as a regulator of insulin secretion in a so called “adipose-insular axis”. Under normal physiological conditions, insulin stimulates adipogenesis and leptin production, whereas leptin inhibits the production of insulin by pancreatic beta cells. However, as the individual put on weight, adipose tissue stores increase and leptin reaches supraphysiological levels and loses its capacity to suppress insulin production. As a result, hyperleptinemia is followed by hyperinsulinemia, which leads to hyperglycemia in the long term <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Vickers1">[28]</xref>. Furthermore, it is widely known that normal levels of insulin inhibit G6Pase and PEPCK gene transcription and overexpression of these enzymes is a consequence of IR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-DeSouza1">[29]</xref>. In this study, it was demonstrated that the HF offspring presented an elevated expression of both enzymes that characterizes IR. On the other hand, treatment with BZ reduced the expression of theses enzymes in both treated groups, pointing the effects of BZ on improvement of insulin sensibility.</p>
<p>Activation of PPAR<italic>alpha</italic> by BZ is widely known as an important step to produce its hypolipidemic effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Teramoto1">[30]</xref>. Reducing adiposity index and modifying WAT's secretion profile, BZ yields normalization of leptin levels and restoration of adequate insulin levels. This explanation agrees with glucose metabolism improvement observed in the drug-treated offspring from diet-induced obese dams.</p>
<p>The HF offspring's WAT showed elevated numbers of larger adipocytes in comparison with the SC offspring, complying with expansion of visceral WAT and hypertrophy of adipocytes. Thus, these animals also showed altered metabolism of WAT, showing increased release of pro-inflammatory adipokines such as IL-6, resistin and TNF-<italic>alpha</italic> and decreased adiponectin plasma levels as observed in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-CattaPreta1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Kwon1">[31]</xref>. Treatment with BZ has beneficial effects attenuating the pro-inflammatory adipokine profile in the HF/BZ offspring. Several works have demonstrated that activation of the PPAR isoforms could change the obesity-induced inflammatory state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Nagasawa1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Lee1">[32]</xref>. PPAR<italic>alpha</italic> activation serves as a negative regulator of the inflammatory process by antagonizing the activity of tissue factor pathways linked to inflammation such as the nuclear factor (NF)-<italic>kappa</italic>B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Kleemann1">[33]</xref>.</p>
<p>PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> activation in WAT is responsible for decreased production of adipokines that cause IR, such as TNF<italic>alpha</italic> and resistin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Steppan1">[34]</xref>. Additionally, PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> activation causes apoptosis of mature and large adipocytes and increases the population of small adipocytes, which are more insulin sensitive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Okuno1">[35]</xref>. These findings are in accordance with results found here in drug-treated offspring such as increased expression of PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> in WAT, the increase in the number of adipocytes per area and in the population of small adipocytes, as well as decreased adipocyte diameter, indicating an improvement of morphology and consequently metabolism of this tissue. These data indicate that BZ is a potent drug that can be used to reverse the WAT inflammatory state through PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> activation. Besides, PPAR<italic>alpha</italic> also has an important role in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation in adipocytes even with lower PPAR<italic>alpha</italic> mRNA expression level in adipocytes than in the liver. Furthermore, activation of this TF also leads to adipocytes differentiation, suggesting that PPAR<italic>alpha</italic>-specific adipogenic pathways exist, although the effect of PPAR<italic>alpha</italic> seems to be partially shared with that of PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Goto1">[36]</xref>. Our results show that both drug-treated groups presented an elevation in the expression of PPAR<italic>alpha</italic> in WAT. Interestingly, there is no difference between the SC offspring and the HF offspring, but it is important to consider and highlight that the HF offspring were weaned onto a balanced diet.</p>
<p>Adiponectin down-regulation in obesity is a key factor in the development of NAFLD because it is closely linked to IR and diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Nagasawa1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-BarbosadaSilva1">[20]</xref>. Likewise plasmatic levels, WAT expression of adiponectin was lower in the HF offspring than in the SC offspring. Both conditions were reversed by treatment with BZ. Furthermore, adiponectin is a direct target of regulation by PPAR<italic>gamma</italic>, whose expression was also increased in WAT from our treated animals, corroborating our results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Berg1">[37]</xref>. When treated with Pioglitazone, a PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> agonist, 3T3-L1 adipocytes presented enhanced insulin sensitivity through an upregulation of adiponectin receptor 2 (AdipoR2) and adiponectin, a novel pathway that might be addressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Kudoh1">[38]</xref>.</p>
<p>The high hepatic TG levels found in the HF offspring was alleviated by treatment in HF/BZ offspring. These data correlate with hepatic steatosis, confirming the effects of diet-induced maternal obesity in the development of NAFLD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Gregorio1">[3]</xref>. Moreover, higher level of hepatocyte binucleation in the HF offspring than in the SC offspring indicates an unsuccessful attempt to recover from liver damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-SouzaMello1">[12]</xref>. Targeting PPARs with BZ reduced hepatic steatosis as well as binucleation rate, leading to improvement in hepatic structure.</p>
<p>PPAR<italic>alpha</italic> activation by fibrates in rodents induces hepatic peroxisomal proliferation and hepatomegaly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Hays1">[39]</xref>. In fact, the dose administered caused an increase in liver mass in both treated groups; however, this effect is lost in humans, even when fibrates maintain PPAR<italic>alpha</italic> activation. It has been proposed that PPAR<italic>alpha</italic> is more highly expressed in the hepatic tissue in rodents than in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Berger1">[40]</xref>. However, the role of PPAR<italic>alpha</italic> as the master regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism is well conserved between these species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Rakhshandehroo1">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>TG accumulation in the liver is a result of increased hepatic fatty acid synthesis and/or decreased <italic>beta</italic>-oxidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Desvergne1">[42]</xref>. PPARs target differently hepatic <italic>beta</italic>-oxidation and lipogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Desvergne1">[42]</xref> and in order to gain insight into molecular mechanism involved into these processes, evaluation of the expression of some proteins as well as mRNA expression are relevant. PPAR<italic>alpha</italic> target genes encode enzymes involved with mitochondrial <italic>beta</italic>-oxidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Tenenbaum3">[43]</xref>, by which PPAR<italic>alpha</italic> has a role in energy homeostasis, contributing greatly to energy production via oxidative phosphorylation generating ATP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Desvergne1">[42]</xref>. Our findings showed that both drug-treated groups exhibited high levels of PPAR<italic>alpha</italic> expression and that conversely, the HF offspring showed lower levels of PPAR<italic>alpha</italic> expression after exposure to diet-induced maternal obesity. The expression of PPAR<italic>alpha</italic> correlates inversely with hepatic steatosis degree. CPT-1, a target gene of PPAR<italic>alpha</italic>, is the mitochondrial gateway for fatty acid entry into the mitochondrial matrix, being the master regulator of the hepatic mitochondrial <italic>beta</italic>-oxidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Desvergne1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Lee2">[44]</xref>, and it was reported that patients with NAFLD presents a decreased expression of CPT-1 gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Serviddio1">[45]</xref>. Our findings showed that BZ could restore the expression of CPT-1 in both treated groups, ameliorating the hepatic steatosis caused by maternal diet-induced obesity.</p>
<p>Although PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> is expressed at low concentrations in hepatic tissue, patients with NAFLD/NASH exhibit significantly high levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Pettinelli1">[46]</xref>. Concomitantly, SREBP-1c is also found in high levels in patients with NAFLD, acting with PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> to favor lipogenesis and accumulation of triglycerides in hepatic tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Gregorio1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Chen1">[47]</xref>. According to our data, diet-induced maternal obesity led to an increase in both PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> and SREBP-1c in HF offspring, which justifies the steatosis found in this group. However, treatment with BZ decreased PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> expression in the liver of the HF/BZ offspring in comparison to the untreated HF offspring, reducing hepatic lipogenesis.</p>
<p>Fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36, a PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> target gene, is involved with long chain fatty acid (LCFAs) transport into mitochondria, correlating with oxidative capacity of the liver as long as CPT-1 is also present <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Lee2">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Campbell1">[48]</xref>. Although (FAT)/CD36 does not play a significant role in fatty acid uptake in liver, it makes possible the initial metabolization of LCFA, consisting of shortening its chain to enable the fatty acid to enter the mitochondria through CPT-1 action (maximum of 20 carbons in the molecule) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Campbell1">[48]</xref>. Although HF group presented enhanced expression of (FAT)/CD36 mRNA, those animals also had lower levels of CPT-1 mRNA. Hence, the acetyl-coA resulting from the shortening of LCFA that cannot enter <italic>beta</italic>-oxidation pathway and might be deviated to lipogenesis and/or ketone bodies formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Desvergne1">[42]</xref>. Besides, excessive fatty acids could be stored as lipid droplets. Conversely, the increased mRNA levels of CD36 in treated groups reinforce the activation of the three PPARs isoforms by BZ as PPAR<italic>beta</italic> activation increases the capacity of PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> to induce CD36 transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Vosper1">[49]</xref>. A previous work showed that Bezafibrate (Pan-PPAR agonist) overcome Troglitazone (total PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> agonist) potential to induce CD36 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Cabrero1">[50]</xref>. In the present study, interplay between (FAT)/CD36 and CPT-1, both higher expressed in treated groups, guarantees the maximum oxidative activity within hepatic mitochondria, enhancing fatty acid metabolization and, thus, reducing hepatic steatosis.</p>
<p>The reduced PPAR<italic>alpha</italic>/SREBP-1c ratio observed in the untreated HF offspring indicates higher SREBP-1c activation with lower PPAR<italic>alpha</italic> expression, agreeing with a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Pettinelli2">[51]</xref> that showed higher SREBP-1c/PPAR<italic>alpha</italic> ratio in obese patients. Although BZ did not modify SREBP-1c expression levels in the HF group, the activation of PPAR<italic>alpha</italic> in the treated groups is more significant than SREBP-1c activation, favoring <italic>beta</italic>-oxidation. Similarly, the PPAR<italic>alpha</italic>/PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> ratio was significantly decreased in the offspring from diet-induced obese dams and increased in the treated offspring.</p>
<p>The literature emphasizes that both PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> and SREBP-1c are essential to trigger hepatic lipogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Pettinelli2">[51]</xref>. However, SREBP-1c seems to be an auxiliary of PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Brown1">[52]</xref>, which emerges as the master regulator of hepatic lipogenesis. In this way, SREBP-1c deletion in mice results in 50% less fatty acid synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Liang1">[53]</xref>, whereas mice deficient in liver-specific PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> are completely protected against steatosis development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Gavrilova1">[54]</xref>. In the present study, treatment with BZ did not modify SREBP-1c expression in the HF/BZ offspring when compared to the HF offspring. Despite unchanged expression of SREBP-1c mRNA after treatment with BZ, levels of PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> mRNA were considerably reduced, being crucial to the lower hepatic triglycerides and liver steatosis found in this treated group.</p>
<p>Additionally, the relative abundance of PPAR<italic>alpha</italic> in normal liver depicted by and increased PPAR<italic>alpha</italic>/PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> ratio in treated groups, causes this receptor to act as a regulator of fatty acid catabolism, minimizing the need to store these lipids in hepatocytes. Therefore, PPAR<italic>alpha</italic> could protect the liver against PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> lipogenic activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064258-Way1">[55]</xref>.</p>
<p>All of these findings support the conclusion that BZ can ameliorate hepatic metabolic abnormalities because it causes an increase in <italic>beta</italic>-oxidation via PPAR<italic>alpha</italic> activation and rise in the target gene CPT-1 in association with a decrease in PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> expression and no change in SREBP-1c expression.</p>
<p>The observation that increased PPAR<italic>alpha</italic>/PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> ratio counters hepatic lipogenesis, even with a lack of effect upon SREBP-1c expression, creates new perspectives aiming to unravel pathways by which PPAR<italic>alpha</italic> can protect the liver against lipogenesis induced by PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> overexpression as well as the precise mechanisms that underlie SREBP-1c and PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> interaction in the development of NAFLD.</p>
<p>The present study has certain limitations. The major aim of this study was to verify the efficiency of BZ to reverse the alterations caused by maternal diet-induced obesity in offspring's liver and WAT. Therefore, we examined the activation of PPAR<italic>alpha</italic> and PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> through BZ as well as proteins related to <italic>beta</italic>-oxidation and lipogenesis and metabolic parameters. Further studies are necessary to clarify separate actions of PPAR<italic>alpha</italic> and PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> in both organs as a <italic>pair-feeding</italic> group would enrich the discussion about BM loss and the role of PPARs in this context.</p>
<p>In conclusion, diet-induced maternal obesity lead to alterations in metabolism, hepatic lipotoxicity and adverse liver and adipose tissue remodeling caused in the offspring. Targeting PPAR by BZ has beneficial effects reducing the alterations, mainly through reduction of WAT inflammatory state through PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> activation and enhanced hepatic beta-oxidation due to increased PPAR<italic>alpha</italic>/PPAR<italic>gamma</italic> ratio in liver, resulting in higher expression of target genes involved with this pathway. The relevance of these observations stem from the fact that the effects of maternal obesity are not restricted to the first generation and might compromise future generations, leading to a continuation in increasing rates of obesity and DM2 worldwide.</p>
