        <p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) includes various hepatic pathologies ranging from hepatic steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis and cirrhosis. Estrogen provides a protective effect on the development of NAFLD in women. Therefore, postmenopausal women have a higher risk of developing NAFLD. Hepatic steatosis is an early stage of fatty liver disease. Steatosis can develop to the aggressive stages (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, fibrosis and cirrhosis). Currently, there is no specific drug to prevent/treat these liver diseases. In this study, we found that white button mushroom (WBM), <italic>Agaricus Bisporus</italic>, has protective effects against liver steatosis in ovariectomized (OVX) mice (a model of postmenopausal women). OVX mice were fed a high fat diet supplemented with WBM powder. We found that dietary WBM intake significantly lowered liver weight and hepatic injury markers in OVX mice. Pathological examination of liver tissue showed less fat accumulation in the livers of mice on WBM diet; moreover, these animals had improved glucose clearance ability. Microarray analysis revealed that genes related to the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, particularly the genes for fatty acid synthetase (<italic>Fas</italic>) and fatty acid elongase 6 (<italic>Elovl6</italic>), were down-regulated in the liver of mushroom-fed mice. <italic>In vitro</italic> mechanistic studies using the HepG2 cell line showed that down-regulation of the expression of <italic>FAS</italic> and <italic>ELOVL6</italic> by WBM extract was through inhibition of Liver X receptor (LXR) signaling and its downstream transcriptional factor <italic>SREBP1c</italic>. These results suggest that WBM is protective against hepatic steatosis and NAFLD in OVX mice as a model for postmenopausal women.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease in adults in developed countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Postic1">[1]</xref>. It is characterized by excessive hepatic lipid accumulation and is not related to alcohol use. NAFLD includes various hepatic pathologies ranging from hepatic steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis and cirrhosis. NAFLD is associated with metabolic syndrome, which has been characterized by obesity, type 2 diabetes, arterial hypertension, and hypertriglyceridemia in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Postic1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Sung1">[2]</xref>. Also, cirrhosis is a risk factor for the development of portal hypertension, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Postic1">[1]</xref>. It has been suggested that estrogen provides a protective effect on the development of NAFLD in women <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Suzuki1">[3]</xref>. Therefore, postmenopausal women have a higher risk of developing NAFLD due to a lower level of circulating estrogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Suzuki1">[3]</xref>. Due to an increased average life span, present generations of women can expect to spend at least a third of their lives in the postmenopausal state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Rogers1">[4]</xref>. Dietary and lifestyle guidelines to reduce overall body weight may help avoid NAFLD, however, there are no specific drugs to treat this liver disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Pasumarthy1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Mushroom has been reported to have many bioactive compounds (mycochemicals) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Borchers1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Sullivan1">[7]</xref>. It has been reported that components of various species of mushrooms have a positive impact on human health through effects on the immune system, lipid levels in blood and liver, and tumor growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Borchers1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Jeong1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Nagao1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Chen1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Luk1">[11]</xref>. It is reported that several species of mushroom, including white button mushroom (WBM) (<italic>Agaricus bisporus),</italic> oyster mushroom <italic>(Pleurotus Ostreatus)</italic> and Shiitake (Lentinus edodes), reduce the cholesterol level in serum and/or liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Jeong1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Fukushima1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Bobek1">[13]</xref>. Furthermore, recently mukitake mushroom (<italic>Panellus serotinus</italic>) was reported to alleviate nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in <italic>db/db</italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Nagao1">[9]</xref>. However, the exact mechanisms to prevent NAFLD and its active components have not been identified yet. WBM constitutes 90% of the total mushrooms consumed in the US. Nevertheless, information is limited on health benefits of WBM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Borchers1">[6]</xref>. Previous data in our laboratory showed that WBM had a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of the estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, aromatase-overexpressing breast cancer cell line, MCF-7aro. This effect was through the inhibition of aromatase, the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of estrogen from androgen. In addition, WBM intake inhibited MCF-7aro tumor growth in nude mice. Conjugated linoleic acid was identified as an active component with anti-aromatase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Chen1">[10]</xref>. Based on our preclinical data, a clinical trial of WBM is currently underway in postmenopausal, ER-positive breast cancer survivors to determine whether clinically detectable estrogen suppression can be achieved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Palomares1">[14]</xref>. Although mukitake mushroom was reported to improve NAFLD, due to the observed anti-aromatase effect of WBM, there were clinical concerns that the resulting decrease in estrogen in women could exacerbate NAFLD in postmenopausal women. However, in a recent preclinical study we found that ovariectomized (OVX) mice fed a high fat diet with WBM powder (HFD+WBM) had relatively normal livers in terms of the size and appearance compared to mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) only. These observations, taken together with previous reports that show positive impacts of WBM intake on human health, led us to hypothesize that WBM may improve liver steatosis in postmenopausal women. To support our hypothesis, we also examined the effect of WBM on liver steatosis in the OVX mouse model and fatty acid metabolism in human hepatoma HepG2 cell line. The objective of the study was to gain insight into how dietary supplementation of WBM can prevent and/or ameliorate NAFLD in postmenopausal women.</p>

        <p>WBM were freeze-dried to steady moisture content, and then milled through a fine mesh. Microbiological and other analytical measurements were performed on pooled samples/batches to assure the quality of the WBM powder for research. The control HFD (45% (wt/wt) fat diet) and the HFD modified to contain freeze-dried WBM powder were produced and purchased from Research Diets, Inc (New Brunswick, NJ) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0026654-t001">Table 1</xref>). For a proof-of-concept study to provide definitive data, the diet was composed of 120 g of WBM powder/kg of HFD, a similar dose as used previously to evaluate the effect of Mukitake mushroom diet for NAFLD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Nagao1">[9]</xref>. Moreover, this therapeutic dose of WBM was shown to suppress estrogen-dependent and aromatase-positive breast cancer growth in our laboratory, using a nude mice model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Chen1">[10]</xref>.</p>

        <p>All animal research procedures were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) at City of Hope for assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care, and were in accordance with NIH guidelines. Breeding stock strain C57Bl/6J was obtained from Jackson Labs. All animals were housed at the City of Hope Animal Resources Center in ventilated cage racks, had free access to water and were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle. All institutional guidelines for animal care and use were followed. The protocol for this study was approved by IACUC (protocol number: 08047).</p>
        <p>To create a mouse model of postmenopausal women, seven-week old, female C57B1/6J mice were ovariectomized (OVX, n = 16). These OVX mice only produce estrogen from extragonadal sites and are used extensively as a model of postmenopausal women <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Rogers1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-HoeghAndersen1">[15]</xref>. Control mice (sham, n = 16) were subjected to sham operation survival surgery. The sham mice were subjected to the same general surgical procedure as OVX mice, except the removal of the ovaries. Mice were then divided into two dietary groups, with eight mice per group: HFD or HFD+WBM. The diets were started one week after surgery and continued for 3 months. The pair feeding design was used to control food intake. Food was weighed daily, and the control group given the same amount of food (by weight) one day later as the WBM group to ensure identical caloric intake between groups. At the conclusion of the experiment, mice were fasted for 4 hours before sacrifice. Blood of the mice was collected by cardiac puncture. After mice were euthanized, liver samples were collected.</p>

Synthesis and labeling of complementaryRNA (cRNA) targets, hybridization of GeneChips, and signal detection were carried out by the Microarray Core Facility at City of Hope. Briefly, The Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) was used for microarray gene expression profiles. The microarray was carried out using Ambion's WT Expression kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and Affymetrix's GeneChip Terminal labeling system. Briefly, 100 ng of total RNA was used to start the first strand cDNA synthesis using an engineered random primer plus polyT7 promoter. After the 2<sup>nd</sup> strand cDNA synthesis, the antisense cRNA (in vitro transcription) was carried using T7 RNA polymerase. Then, 10 µg of cRNA was used to start the 2<sup>nd</sup> cycle of cDNA synthesis using random primers plus dUTP and dNTP mix. The single-strand cDNA was fragmented and then end-labeled with biotinylated nucleotides in the presence of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) using Affymetrix WT Terminal Labeling kit.

        <p>Raw intensity measurements of all probe sets were corrected for background, normalized and converted into transcript-level expression measurements by using the IterPlier method in Affymetrix Power Tools (version 1.8.6). Quality assessment and statistical analysis of gene expression data were performed using the R/Bioconductor packages. To ensure the high quality of the microarray process, a set of quality assessment steps implemented in Bioconductor package Array Tools (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ArrayTools.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ArrayTools.html</ext-link>) were applied to the data. ArryTools was then used to identify the genes differentially expressed between OVX and OVX+WBM samples. Genes with significantly differentially expression were selected by use of cutoffs of p-value of 0.05 and 2-fold change in the level of expression. The genes showing altered expression were categorized and further investigated by enrichment analysis on the basis of their cellular components, biological processes, molecular functions, and canonical pathways using the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA)(Version 9.0)(Ingenuity) software.

The microarray analysis results were validated by real time PCR using RNA extracted from all treatment groups (sham, sham+WBM, OVX and OVX+WBM).

Results showed that addition of WBM to the HFD significantly decreased <italic>Fas</italic> and <italic>Elovl6</italic> expressions in the livers of OVX mice (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05), which is in agreement with the results of our microarray analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026654-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

To evaluate the direct effects of WBM extract on LXR activation, an LXR-luciferase reporter assay was performed.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The results of this study suggest that WBM has a protective effect against liver steatosis in the OVX mice, as a model for postmenopausal women. The protective effect observed in our mouse model with regard to liver steatosis was found to be mediated though the suppression of fatty acid biosynthesis, as indicated by our microarray data. In addition, WBM diet improved insulin resistance observed in OVX mice fed with HFD. Our finding is important since several papers have reported that mushroom may have anti-atherogenic effects through modulation of lipid profiles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Fukushima1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Hossain1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Cheng1">[18]</xref>. Although WBM is the most common edible mushroom in the USA, to our knowledge, this is the first study to show WBM has a protective effect against liver steatosis in the mouse model of postmenopausal women.</p>
      <p>NAFLD is a disease more frequent in postmenopausal women than premenopausal women <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-GutierrezGrobe1">[19]</xref>. Aromatase knockout mice, which are deficient in estrogen pathway, develop hepatic steatosis. Moreover, hepatic steatosis was diminished in animals treated with E2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Nemoto1">[20]</xref>. Patients with a mutation of the aromatase gene showed liver steatohepatitis, and estrogen treatment resulted in the improvement of liver steatohepatitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Maffei1">[21]</xref>. These reports confirm that estrogen has an important protective role against the development of NAFLD. Tamoxifen is an antiestrogen used widely in the treatment and chemoprevention of breast cancer. Hepatic steatosis and non-alchoholic steatohepatitis have been reported in patients treated with tamoxifen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Jordan1">[22]</xref>. Therefore, fat accumulation in liver is an important clinical concern in postmenopausal women, especially those have anti-estrogenic therapy. OVX mouse is the established model for postmenopausal women. Studies in rodents showed that OVX promotes obesity and its metabolic complication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Rogers1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-HoeghAndersen1">[15]</xref>. As a model of postmenopausal women, our studies using OVX mice confirm a high fat diet promotes liver steatosis, and a WBM-containing diet can alleviate liver steatosis. The serum transaminase (ALT) level was measured, as a sensitive method used in the detection of liver statosis in clinical diagnosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Postic1">[1]</xref>; it is also linked to liver fat content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Andersson1">[23]</xref>. Our results showed that serum ALT levels were significantly lowered in OVX mice fed with WBM, to a similar level as in sham mice. It is worthwhile to note that the WBM did not change mouse body weight, but did have an impact on liver steatosis. This suggests that WBM affects liver function specifically. Several rodent models have shown that decreasing hepatic triglyceride pools correlates with improved insulin sensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Postic1">[1]</xref>. Also, several lines of evidence suggest that lipid metabolites in the lipogenesis pathway in liver are determinants for the development of insulin resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Postic1">[1]</xref>. Thus, we performed glucose resistance tests to evaluate glucose clearance ability in OVX mice fed with WBM diet. Our data showed that a WBM diet could improve steatosis-associated insulin resistance in the OVX mice.</p>
      <p>Our group previously reported that WBM extract inhibited breast cancer cell growth <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> through inhibition of the aromatase enzyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Chen1">[10]</xref>. Our studies have revealed that the chemicals that suppress fatty acid biosynthesis in liver are different from those that inhibit aromatase activity. Furthermore, the WBM extract does not have any estrogen-like activity, indicating that the protective mechanism of WBM against liver steatosis is not estrogen-mediated. Uterus weights were not changed in both sham treated and OVX mice fed with WBM diet compared to those fed with HFD only diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026654-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). These results suggest that WBM did not significantly change circulating estrogen levels in both sham treated and OVX mice. Based on our current data, WBM may have a beneficial effect on the liver in postmenopausal women even at low estrogen conditions, particularly those women who are under anti-estrogen therapy.</p>
      <p>Microarray analysis revealed that multiple enzymes involved in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway were significantly down regulated in the liver of OVX mice fed with a diet containing WBM. <italic>Fas</italic> and <italic>Elovl6</italic> were most down regulated by WBM treatment. FAS plays an important role in the synthesis of fatty acids via <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis. FAS catalyzes the last step in the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Postic1">[1]</xref>. ELOVL6 is a rate-limiting enzyme for the elongation of saturated and monounsaturated long chain fatty acids. ELOVL6 is expressed in the liver and its mRNA levels are up-regulated in obese animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Miyazaki1">[24]</xref>. Thus, researchers have evaluated the therapeutic potential of ELOVL6 inhibitors for metabolic disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Shimamura1">[25]</xref>. HepG2 is a human liver-derived hepatoma cell line, and many liver-specific functions are maintained in this cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Gibbons1">[26]</xref>. Since the expression of FAS and ELOVL6 was decreased after WBM extract treatment <italic>in vitro</italic> in the HepG2 cells, the active components in WBM are probably not metabolites of biological conversion in an intact animal. Moreover, multiple enzymes in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway are down-regulated by WBM extract, suggesting common mechanisms may exist to regulate multiple enzymes. LXR has been reported to control genes that encode proteins involved in <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis, including <italic>FAS</italic> and <italic>ELOVL6</italic>. Moreover SREBP1c is regulated through LXR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Postic1">[1]</xref>. Oral administration of the synthetic LXR agonist, T0901317, to C57BL/6 mice resulted in increased hepatic triglyceride levels, leading to liver steatosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Grefhorst1">[27]</xref>. Our results showed that WBM extract down-regulated T0901317-induced LXR receptor activity in the HepG2 cells, suggesting that WBM extract mainly modulates LXR function in liver.</p>
      <p>We also evaluated the effects of several types of mushrooms <italic>in vitro</italic> using the HepG2 cells. All of the mushroom extracts showed a dose-dependent inhibition of the expression of <italic>FAS</italic> and <italic>ELOVL6</italic>. Although significant efforts have been made, we cannot yet identify the phytochemicals that are responsible for the “anti-liver steatosis” effect of mushrooms. Our previous report showed that CLA is an active component with anti-aromatase activity (to reduce estrogen) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Chen1">[10]</xref>. The CLA-containing fractions did not show strong inhibition of <italic>ELOVL6</italic> and <italic>FAS</italic> gene expression in HepG2 cells. Moreover, treatment with CLA did not decrease liver weight and accumulation of fat in the livers of OVX mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Kanaya1">[28]</xref>. These results suggest that CLA is not the active component in the inhibition of the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway in liver. Phytosterols, such as oxysterols, have been found to be ligands of LXR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Edwards1">[29]</xref>. Ergosterol peroxide is an oxysterol that can be produced by a hydrogen peroxide-dependent enzymatic oxidation of ergosterol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Sgarbi1">[30]</xref>. Ergosterol is an important sterol in WBM and is shown to be a vitamin D2 precursor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-Shao1">[31]</xref>. However, ergosterol was not able to inhibit the expression of <italic>ELOVL6</italic> and <italic>FAS</italic> in HepG2 cells in our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies (data not shown), suggesting that the active chemical(s) may be another sterol or oxidized sterol.</p>
      <p>In order to determine whether our results have a potential application to women's health, the human equivalent of doses used in this study needs to be determined. The average WBM intake in mouse studies is approximately 260 mg/day (average food intake 2.2g/day, WBM diet 120 g powder/kg diet). The human equivalent dose (based on body surface area) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026654-ReaganShaw1">[32]</xref> is equal to 42 g WBM powder for a 60 kg person. It is important to point out that this would be a therapeutic dose to achieve the development of NAFLD. This is a proof-of-concept study; therefore, the liver protective effect could be achieved probably with lower levels of WBM for women consuming a regular diet. Moreover, drug discovery from natural products has been one of the main approaches to develop new drugs. We are continuing our efforts in the functional characterization of active components in WBM.</p>
      <p>In summary, NAFLD is a widespread problem associated with many metabolic disorders that has become increasingly prevalent in our society. Postmenopausal women have the highest risk of developing NAFLD, compared to premenopausal women and men. The incidence would be even higher for those postmenopausal women under anti-estrogen therapy and with a high BMI. The pathogenesis of NAFLD is complicated and involves multiple pathways. Single protein target drugs are not successful in the treatment of NAFLD, and there is currently no generally accepted therapeutic intervention for NAFLD. To date, the only effective treatment of NAFLD is a general lifestyle change, including diet, weight reduction and exercise. Our results showed that WBM intake may be a viable dietary choice to prevent liver steatosis, which is an early reversible stage of NAFLD in postmenopausal women. WBM is widely available and inexpensive. If this effect could be demonstrated in humans, postmenopausal women would have a natural option for avoiding liver steatosis and its associated conditions. This prevention of early stage of the disease leads to reduce the risk of NAFLD. Furthermore, at the same time, WBM would suppress aromatase to decrease risk of breast cancer.</p>
