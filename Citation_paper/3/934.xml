      <abstract>
        <p>Nicotine enhances synaptic transmission and facilitates long-term memory. Now it is known that bi-directional glia-neuron interactions play important roles in the physiology of the brain. However, the involvement of glial cells in the effects of nicotine has not been considered until now. In particular, the gliotransmitter D-serine, an endogenous co-agonist of NMDA receptors, enables different types of synaptic plasticity and memory in the hippocampus. Here, we report that hippocampal long-term synaptic plasticity induced by nicotine was annulled by an enzyme that degrades endogenous D-serine, or by an NMDA receptor antagonist that acts at the D-serine binding site. Accordingly, both effects of nicotine: the enhancement of synaptic transmission and facilitation of long-term memory were eliminated by impairing glial cells with fluoroacetate, and were restored with exogenous D-serine. Together, these results show that glial D-serine is essential for the long-term effects of nicotine on synaptic plasticity and memory, and they highlight the roles of glial cells as key participants in brain functions.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The role of astrocytes in the central nervous system has been redefined, and they are now accepted as the third element in the synapses, alongside the pre- and postsynaptic neurons, astrocytes sense neuronal activity and respond with Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations which, in turn, can induce the release of gliotransmitters such as ATP, glutamate, and D-serine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-BenAchour1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Perea1">[2]</xref>. For instance, astrocytes surround a substantial portion of synapses which are largely glutamatergic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Magistretti1">[3]</xref>. In the hippocampus almost 60% of synapses have an apposed astrocytic process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Ventura1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Bushong1">[5]</xref>. The release of the gliotransmitter D-serine, an endogenous co-agonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Mothet1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Oliet1">[7]</xref>, has been implicated in different types of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity including long-term potentiation and depression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Fossat1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Henneberger1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Takata1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Zhang1">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, nicotine is considered to be the main addictive substance of tobacco, and it affects several brain functions due to its affinity for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Albuquerque1">[12]</xref>. Nicotine has effects on mnemonic functions; for example, nicotine improves long-term spatial memory, as measured in the Morris Water Maze <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Rangani1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Socci1">[14]</xref> and procedural learning, evaluated in the one-trial step-through inhibitory-avoidance task <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Rezayof1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Sansone1">[16]</xref>. Administration of nicotine also enhances cognitive functions in pathological conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Rangani1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Jones1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Newhouse1">[18]</xref>, and it reverses memory deficits caused by a lesion of the cholinergic system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Decker1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Kenney1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Levin1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Placzek1">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The effect of nicotine on hippocampal synaptic plasticity has been widely documented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Kenney1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Placzek1">[22]</xref> and is known to involve the activation and desensitization of nAChRs present on interneurons and pyramidal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Jia1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-LeMagueresse1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Matsuyama1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Nakauchi1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Yamazaki1">[27]</xref>. Furthermore, the fact that hippocampal astrocytes express nAChRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Gahring1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-HernandezMorales1">[29]</xref> and respond to nAChR agonists by increasing their intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Sharma1">[30]</xref>, raises the possibility that astrocytes could also be mediating nicotine effects in the hippocampus. Although there is no evidence of causality between long-term synaptic plasticity and memory, glial cells are critical for some types of memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Zhang1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-BenMenachemZidon1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Newman1">[32]</xref>. Thus, glial cells could also mediate nicotine facilitation of long-term memory and the enhancement of synaptic transmission. In the present work, we show that glial cells, very likely through the release of D-serine, are essential for nicotine potentiation of synaptic transmission and nicotine facilitation of long-term memory.</p>

        <p>A concentric bipolar platinum electrode (25 µm diameter; FHC Inc., Bowdoin ME, USA) was placed in the <italic>stratum radiatum</italic> of the CA1 hippocampal region to stimulate Schaffer collaterals. Evoked field potentials (EFP) were recorded in the <italic>stratum radiatum</italic> using glass electrodes filled with 2 M NaCl and with a resistance of 1–2 MΩ. When required, the paired-pulse protocol was applied to induce synaptic responses. The test stimulus duration was 150 µs with an interpulse interval of 60 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049998-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The stimulus intensity was adjusted in each experiment to elicit 60–70% of the maximum response. A paired-pulse was delivered every 15 s. The paired-pulse ratio (PPR) was defined as the quotient between the slope of the second response (P2) and the slope of the first response (P1), i.e., P2/P1. This parameter was used to evaluate changes in the probability of neurotransmitter release from Schaffer collaterals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Zucker1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Zucker2">[34]</xref><monospace>. </monospace>Each point on the time curse graphs corresponds to the mean of 20 stimuli (5 min of recording). To induce long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission, in the presence of 50 µM picrotoxin (an antagonist of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors) we applied two, 1-s trains of high-frequency stimulation (HFS, 100 Hz) with a 5-s inter-train interval. The EFP were recorded with an Axopatch-200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, CA) and filtered at 5 KHz. Data were acquired and stored for offline analysis with Digidata 1200, Clampfit 9.0 (Axon Instruments, CA) and Sigma plot 9.0 software.</p>

Stainless steel guide cannulae (23-gauge) were bilaterally implanted into the dorsal hippocampus (AP = −4.0, L ±2.6, V = −2.5); the nose bar was set at −3.3 mm from the interaural line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Paxinos1">[35]</xref>. The cannulae were affixed to the skull using two screws and dental acrylic, and a stylet was inserted in each cannula and retained there at all times except during the injections. The rats were allowed seven days to recover from surgical procedures before the initiation of training.</p>

          <title>Training and memory tests</title>
          <p>The rats were trained in a one-trial step-through inhibitory-avoidance task. The training and retention testing were carried out in an apparatus with two distinct compartments, separated by a guillotine door. The safe compartment (30×30×30 cm) had walls and lid of red-colored acrylic with a floor of stainless steel bars (6 mm in diameter, separated by 9 mm). This compartment was illuminated by a 10-Watt light bulb located in the center of its lid. The other, shock compartment had front and back walls and floor made of stainless steel with end walls and lid made of red-colored acrylic. The compartment was 30 cm long and 25 cm deep. The walls and floor were shaped as a trough, 20 cm wide at the top and 8 cm wide at the bottom. In the middle of the floor, a 1.5-cm slot separated the two stainless steel plates that made up the walls and floor. When in this compartment, the rats were in contact with both plates that can be electrified and, thereby, deliver aversive stimulation consistently to every subject. A square-pulse stimulator (Grass S-48), in series with a constant current unit (Grass CCU-1A), generated the electric shock. The duration of shock and the measurement of latencies to cross from one compartment to the other were accomplished with automated equipment. The conditioning box was located inside a dark, sound-proof room provided with background masking noise.</p>
          <p>Rats were placed in the safe compartment; 10 s later the guillotine door was opened, and latency to enter was recorded (training latency). When the rat was completely inside the dark compartment the door was closed and a foot-shock (0.7 mA) was delivered. After 5 s, the door was opened, allowing the animal to escape into the first compartment (escape latency). After 30 s in the safe compartment the animal was put back in its home cage. Forty-eight hours later, during the retention test (long-term memory), the same procedure was followed except that the foot-shock was not delivered. The test was terminated either when the rat entered the dark compartment or after 600 s without entry, and a score of 600 was assigned to the retention latency.</p>

        <p>For electrophysiological experiments, the drugs were diluted in ACSF and applied in the superfusion bath. In all experiments, 30 min of stable baseline was recorded before each drug administration. Depending on the purpose of each experiment, slices were incubated with D-(–)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5, 50 µM), D-serine (20 µM), 5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid (DCKA, 200 nM), nicotine (1 µM), fluoroacetate (FAC, 5 mM), mecamylamine (50 µM), or D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO, 0.1 U/ml). The DAAO enzyme was dialyzed for 8–10 h at 4°C against 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate pH 8–8.5 containing 10 µM flavin adenine dinucleotide and stored at −20°C until use. For the behavioral tests, the drugs were diluted in 0.9% NaCl and administrated at different times before training: FAC (5, 10, 20, or 40 mM at 40 min), D-serine (100 µM at 40 min) and AP5 (50 mM at 20 min) in the CA1 hippocampal region, or nicotine (1 ml/kg at 15 min with doses of 0.2, 0.4, or 0.6 mg/kg) subcutaneously.

        <p>In each of the electrophysiological experiments, data were obtained from 5 to 11 slices. For the time course plots, the results are shown as means ± S.E.M. of the EFP slope, relative to baseline (the mean of the first 30 min of recording). The early and late effects correspond to the mean measured from 10 to 20 and 50 to 60 min, respectively, after electrical stimulation, nicotine, or FAC administration. These two components were compared to the baseline EFP slope (control) using the repeated-measures one-way ANOVA. Due to changes produced by FAC, when nicotine or HFS was preceded by FAC, the synaptic responses previous to nicotine or HFS were used as another group to compare. To determine if there were significant differences between measurements, the <italic>post hoc</italic> Fisher test was used. When only two groups were compared a Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was used. If the measurements were done in the same slices, then paired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was utilized.</p>
        <p>In the behavioral experiments, only the rats in which the cannulae were located in the CA1 hippocampal region were included in the analyses. The final sample size for each group was between 6 and 11 rats. Because the measurement of retention was truncated at 600 s, nonparametric statistics were used. Independent Kruskal-Wallis analyses of variance were computed to compare training, escape, and retention latencies among groups. When appropriate, the Mann-Whitney U test was used to make comparisons between any two groups.</p>

        <title>Glial Cells Are Required for Long-term Nicotine Effects in Synaptic Transmission</title>
        <p>It is well known that nicotine modulates synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Kenney1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-He1">[36]</xref>. Thus, the effects of nicotine on synaptic transmission were evaluated by measuring the EFP slope and the PPR produced in the CA1 hippocampal region by stimulating Schaffer collaterals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049998-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>
        <p>First, we applied a brief administration (7 min) of a low concentration of nicotine (1 µM), close to the brain nicotine concentration after smoke one cigarette: 520–770 nM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Rose1">[37]</xref>. Thus, nicotine by itself increased the EFP slope of P1 in hippocampal slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049998-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Maximal potentiation was observed 15 min after nicotine administration (204±45% relative to baseline). Later, the responses of synaptic transmission diminished but remained above baseline after 60 min of nicotine administration (135±19% relative to baseline; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049998-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>
        <p>The statistical analysis (ANOVA) of the early and late effects of nicotine showed a significant treatment effect (F<sub>2,20</sub> = 8.36; p = 0.002). The Fisher test indicated that both early and late components (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref>) were significantly different from the control (p&lt;0.001, p = 0.03, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049998-g001">Fig. 1H</xref>). The analysis of the PPR showed a significant effect of nicotine (F<sub>3,30</sub> = 4.327; p = 0.012). The Fisher test indicated a decrease of the PPR during the nicotine administration with respect to the control (p = 0.007; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049998-g001">Fig. 1C, right panel</xref>), without an effect on the early and late components (p = 0.74, p = 0.78, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049998-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). The role of nAChRs was revealed when slices were preincubated with mecamylamine, a non-selective nAChR antagonist; in this condition, nicotine did not modify the EFP slope (F<sub>2,10</sub> = 0.33, p = 0.72; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049998-g001">Fig. 1D, H</xref>).</p>
        <p>The involvement of NMDA receptors in nicotine potentiation of synaptic transmission is controversial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Yamazaki1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-He1">[36]</xref>. To determine if these receptors were participating, nicotine was applied in the continuous presence of an antagonist of the NMDA receptors, AP5. In this condition, a small enhancement of the early component was observed when nicotine was administrated, without affecting the responses of the late component (p = 0.028 p = 0.22, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049998-g001">Fig. 1E, H</xref>). Additionally, once established the nicotine potentiation of synaptic transmission (late component), AP5 was applied and the EFP slope returned to the baseline (p = 0.495 with respect to baseline; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049998-g001">Fig. 1F, H</xref>), indicating that nicotine induced a NMDA receptor-dependent long-lasting synaptic plasticity. The administration of AP5 alone to hippocampal slices did not affect the EFP slope with respect to the control (paired <italic>t</italic>-test, p = 0.89; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0049998.s001">Fig. S1A, C</xref>).</p>
        <p>Because hippocampal astrocytes express functional nAChRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-HernandezMorales1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Sharma1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Shen1">[38]</xref> we asked whether glial cells were mediating long-term enhancement of synaptic transmission by nicotine. To determine the role of glial cells in this synaptic plasticity, we studied the effects of FAC, a selective inhibitor of glial cell metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Fonnum1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Waniewski1">[40]</xref>. Perfusion of the hippocampal slices with FAC led to an increase in the EFP slope relative to baseline (late, 150±17%; paired <italic>t</italic>-test, p = 0.02; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0049998.s001">Fig. S1B, C</xref>). To determine whether this increase was also mediated by NMDA receptors, AP5 was applied after the onset of FAC administration. Under this condition FAC still increased the EFP slope (paired <italic>t</italic>-test, p = 0.02; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0049998.s001">Fig. S1B, C</xref>), which suggest that the effect of FAC was not dependent on NMDA receptors.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, when nicotine was administrated in the presence of FAC, a significant reduction of the synaptic responses was observed in the early component (p = 0.048), without any effect on the late component (p = 0. 326) Because FAC administration increased synaptic transmission, a depotentiation of the responses rather than a depression would better describe this effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-OMara1">[41]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Glial D-serine Is Necessary for the Long-term Effects of Nicotine on Synaptic Transmission</title>
        <p>Because NMDA receptors are required for the enhancement of synaptic transmission by nicotine, and the gliotransmitter D-serine is involved in synaptic plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Oliet1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Takata1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Zhang1">[11]</xref>, we hypothesized that D-serine could also mediate the long-term effects of nicotine on synaptic transmission. To address this point, D-serine and DCKA (an agonist and an antagonist of the NMDA receptors, respectively, both acting at the glycine-binding site) were administered. The application of these drugs by themselves did not induce changes in synaptic transmission with respect to their controls (paired <italic>t</italic>-test, D-serine: p = 0.95; DCKA: p = 0.47; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0049998.s002">Fig. S2A</xref>–C). In the presence of D-serine, nicotine potentiated synaptic transmission (F<sub>2,16</sub> = 8.14, p = 0.004) of both the early and late components (p = 0.001 and 0.01, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049998-g002">Fig. 2A, E</xref>), and the maximal potentiation was similar to that with nicotine alone (paired <italic>t</italic>-test p = 0.28). Interestingly, in the presence of DCKA, nicotine potentiation of synaptic transmission was not observed. Moreover, after nicotine administration, a significant depression (F<sub>2,8</sub> = 14.24, p = 0.002) of synaptic responses was observed in the late component (early p = 0.24; late p≤0.008; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049998-g002">Fig. 2B, E</xref>).</p>

        <p>When hippocampal slices were superfused before (60 min), during, and after nicotine application with DAAO, an enzyme that specifically degrades endogenous D-serine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Zhang1">[11]</xref>, nicotine again failed to potentiate synaptic transmission (F<sub>2,12</sub> = 0.35, p = 0.5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049998-g002">Fig. 2C, E</xref>). Together, these results strongly suggest that endogenous D-serine is provided by glial cells and that it is required for the long-lasting enhancement of synaptic transmission by nicotine. If this is true, exogenous D-serine in the presence of FAC should restore nicotine effects. Indeed, when nicotine was administrated in the presence of FAC and D-serine, a significant effect on EFP was found (F<sub>3,21</sub> = 7.195, p = 0.002). The <italic>post hoc</italic> analyses showed a significant increase in the early and late components (p = 0.027, p≤0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049998-g002">Fig. 2D, E</xref>).</p>

Thus, we tested whether FAC and exogenous D-serine affected long-term potentiation induced by high-frequency electrical stimulation (HFS). Accordingly, the EFP slope in hippocampal slices immediately increased after HFS and was sustained for at least 60 min (p = 0.003, paired <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0049998.s003">Fig. S3A</xref>, B).

The HFS alone or in the presence of FAC, or FAC plus D-serine did not change the PPR (<italic>t</italic>-test, p = 0.76, 0.67, and 0.193, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0049998.s003">Fig. S3C</xref>).</p>

        <p>The fact that there were no significant differences in training latencies among the groups indicates that nicotine and the other drugs that were administered in the remaining experiments of this study did not interfere with the motor and perceptual mechanisms necessary for performance during training. Furthermore, the lack of differences in escape latencies argues against deficiencies in sensitivity to the foot-shock. Therefore, changes in the retention performance in the various experiments can be attributed to the differential effects of the treatments.</p>

The <italic>post hoc</italic> U test indicated that the nicotine group had higher retention scores than the other groups (p values ranging between 0.05 and 0.005); on the other hand, the AP5 and AP5+nicotine groups had significantly lower latencies than the other groups (p values ranging between 0.03 and 0.0003); lastly, the AP5 and AP5+nicotine groups did not differ significantly from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049998-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>
        <p>Taken together, these results show that NMDA receptors are required both for the formation of normal memory and for the facilitatory effect of nicotine on memory.

Consequently, to explore if glial cells are implicated in memory formation, the effects of FAC (an inhibitor of glial cell metabolism) were analyzed.

        <title>Glial D-serine is Necessary for Long-term Memory Facilitated by Nicotine</title>
        <p>Because glial D-serine mediates nicotine potentiation of synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049998-g002">Fig. 2B–D</xref>) and because NMDA receptors are also required for facilitation of long-term memory by nicotine (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049998-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>), it might be that the gliotransmitter D-serine is also involved in long-term memory facilitated by nicotine. To examine this possibility, we tested the effects of nicotine, D-serine, or the combined administration of FAC+nicotine, or FAC+D-serine+nicotine on the inhibitory-avoidance task. From the retention scores, a highly significant treatment effect became evident (H <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Ventura1">[4]</xref> = 21.71, p = 0.001). When compared with the control group, nicotine (0.4 mg/kg) produced a highly significant improvement of memory (p = 0.03; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049998-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). When FAC (10 mM) was infused bilaterally into the CA1 region of hippocampus before nicotine, it produced not only a complete blockade of the nicotine effects, but also an amnesic state (p = 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049998-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). By itself, D-serine (100 µM) did not modify retention of the task. To determine if the gliotransmitter D-serine was also mediating the facilitatory effects of nicotine on long-term memory, FAC was bilaterally co-administrated with D-serine in the CA1 hippocampal region prior to nicotine administration. As expected, the blocking effects of FAC on nicotine facilitation of long-term memory were completely abolished by adding D-serine (p = 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049998-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). These results clearly indicate that glial D-serine is involved in the facilitating effect of nicotine on long-term memory. The endogenous D-serine is sufficient for memory formation because exogenous D-serine has no effect on retention. Thus, to facilitate memory, the activation of both nAChRs by nicotine and NMDA receptors, possibly by D-serine released from glial cells, is required.</p>

Besides the relevant role of neurons, here we showed that the impairment of glial function with FAC is enough to completely block nicotine effects on synaptic transmission and memory. In the hippocampus, several types of synaptic plasticity depend on the availability of the D-serine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Henneberger1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Zhang1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Yang1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Mothet2">[52]</xref>, and the nicotine potentiation of synaptic transmission depends of NMDA receptor activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Yamazaki1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Kanematsu1">[53]</xref> and present work; therefore, it seemed very likely that D-serine was involved in nicotine effects. The results presented here indicate that astrocytes, probably through the release of D-serine, govern the NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity induced by nicotine. This is based on our finding that exogenous D-serine completely restored the effects of nicotine on synaptic plasticity that had been blocked with FAC which is congruent with previous reports where FAC decreases the level of D-serine but not of glycine in the prefrontal cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Fossat1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Kanematsu1">[53]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Although D-serine and the synthesizing enzyme (serine racemase) have been found in neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Miya1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Rosenberg1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Williams1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Wolosker1">[57]</xref>, neuronal D-serine was not able to maintain nicotine effects when glial cells were arrested with FAC, which reinforces the idea that astrocytes are the main source of this D-amino acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Oliet1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Mothet2">[52]</xref>. We also demonstrated that nicotine did not facilitate synaptic transmission when DAAO was added. This result corroborates the requirement for D-serine and also, because DAAO does not degrade glycine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Zhang1">[11]</xref>, it excludes any significant role for endogenous glycine in mediating the nicotine effects.</p>
        <p>It has been reported that, depending on the source of the enzyme, the DAAO might have impurities or low activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Mothet1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Shleper1">[58]</xref>. In our experimental conditions the basal synaptic transmission was not modified in the presence of DAAO for 90 min.

In this sense, although endogenous glutamate is available to potentiate synaptic activity by nicotine, the depletion of endogenous D-serine by DAAO avoids the activation of NMDA receptors, and then nicotine potentiation of synaptic transmission. Moreover, two other approaches were directed toward the D-serine pathway to eliminate their actions: <bold>a</bold>) the impairment of the release of D-serine by FAC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Fossat1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Kanematsu1">[53]</xref> <bold>b</bold>) the antagonism of the D-serine binding site at NMDA receptors by DCKA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Henneberger1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Yang1">[44]</xref>, reinforcing that D-serine is involving in the enhancement of synaptic transmission by nicotine.</p>
        <p>FAC has been widely used to impair glial functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Fossat1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Zhang1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Ikeda1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Muir1">[61]</xref>. Some of the consequences of using FAC are the reduction of ATP concentrations in glial but not neuronal elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Keyser1">[62]</xref>, and inhibition of the stimulated efflux of glutamine, ATP, adenosine, and glutamate from glial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Heinrich1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Uwechue1">[64]</xref>. Thus, several authors refer a reduction in synaptic transmission by FAC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-BergJohnsen1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Bonansco1">[66]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Canals1">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Larrosa1">[68]</xref>. However, it has also been reported that FAC does not affect the spontaneous postsynaptic potentials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Bacci1">[69]</xref>, and that FAC increases glutamatergic transmission mediated by AMPA receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Henneberger1">[9]</xref> but not by NMDA receptors (present work). This potentiation of synaptic transmission induced by FAC might be explained by a reduction of the capability of astrocytes to reuptake glutamate from the synaptic cleft <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Swanson1">[70]</xref> and/or by a decrease of the inhibitory synaptic transmission mediated by astrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Kang1">[71]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Glial cells express nAChRs and responds to different agonists as acetylcholine, choline and nicotine, resulting in increases of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Sharma1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Shen1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Delbro1">[72]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Oikawa1">[73]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-VelezFort1">[74]</xref> that is required for the exocytosis of D-serine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Mothet3">[75]</xref>. On the other hand, FAC is able to reduce the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in astrocytes induced by activation of G-protein-coupled receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Gibbs1">[76]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Greenwood1">[77]</xref>. Thus, it is possible that nicotine is acting directly on astrocytes to induce the release of D-serine and then, when FAC is administrated, a reduction of the nicotine-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases in glial cells with the subsequent decrease in the level of this gliotransmitter would affect the NMDA receptor function that is required for the long-term enhancement of synaptic transmission by nicotine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Yamazaki1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Yamazaki2">[78]</xref> as well as on the plasticity induced by HFS.</p>
        <p>Most of the changes in synaptic transmission in the CA1 hippocampal region require the activation of NMDA receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Citri1">[79]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Malenka1">[80]</xref>. These receptors serve as coincidence detectors of presynaptic and postsynaptic activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Malenka2">[81]</xref> because they require, besides the presence of glutamate and the co-agonist, a membrane depolarization to remove the Mg<sup>2+</sup> blocking from their ion channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Mayer1">[82]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In the present work we observed a decrease of the PPR during the administration of nicotine, suggesting an increase of glutamate release from Schaffer collaterals. This could be explained by activation of presynaptic nAChRs at early times; nevertheless, another option is that nicotine would induce the release of glutamate from the astrocytes that in turn would activate presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors that increase glutamate release from Schaffer collaterals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Bonansco1">[66]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Perea2">[83]</xref>. However, 15 min after nicotine administration, the effect of nicotine on the glutamate release may have been washed out, and only postsynaptic effects mediated by NMDA receptors remained and were maintained for at least 60 min. In this context, a possible scenario would be that, in the presence of nicotine, several effects would participate in concert: a disinhibition of GABAergic interneurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Yamazaki1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-RosatoSiri1">[84]</xref>, an increase in the excitability of the postsynaptic neuron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Albuquerque1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Szabo1">[85]</xref>, an increase of glutamate release by nAChR activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Jia1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-LeMagueresse1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Nakauchi1">[26]</xref>, and the release from astrocytes of D-serine (present work) to enhance NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic transmission. A partial view of all these events is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049998-g006">Figure 6</xref>.

        <p>Additionally, it has been shown that astrocytes modulate the CA3-CA1 synapses through the release of several gliotransmitters (besides D-serine) like ATP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Gibbs1">[76]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Fellin1">[86]</xref> and glutamate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Bonansco1">[66]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Perea2">[83]</xref>. In the present work the role of D-serine in the long-lasting effects of nicotine was analyzed. However, further experiments will be necessary to evaluate the roles of other gliotransmitters mediating nicotine effects in synaptic transmission, plasticity and behavior; particularly, the role of astrocytic glutamate in the presynaptic effect of nicotine.</p>
        <p>Although the links between cellular and molecular mechanisms of long-term synaptic plasticity with cognitive processes are not completely understood, there is a consensus that they represent the basic fundaments for learning and memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Lynch1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Bliss1">[87]</xref>. In fact, long-term potentiation is induced during learning and memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Whitlock1">[43]</xref>. Furthermore, the long-term potentiation induced by HFS and the inhibitory-avoidance task produce the same cellular responses in the hippocampus: an increase in the field potentials, as well as phosphorylation of the AMPA and NMDA receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Whitlock1">[43]</xref>. Accordingly with the results of HFS, FAC produced a lower retention score (amnesia). Because FAC impaired astrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Fossat1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Henneberger1">[9]</xref>, and D-serine completely restore the amnesia produced by FAC, the amnesia could be explained by the lack of glial D-serine.</p>
        <p>The administration of nicotine facilitated long-term memory. For instance, it has been shown a facilitation of retention of inhibitory avoidance by pre- and post-training administration of nicotine into the dorsal hippocampus; the facilitation was also seen when nicotine was infused before testing for long-term memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-MartiBarros1">[88]</xref>, we show that nicotine effects on memory depend on the presence of D-serine (presumably released from glial cells) and the consequent activation of NMDA receptors, possibly following a similar sequence of cellular and molecular events previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Whitlock1">[43]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Cholinergic signaling involving muscarinic and/or nicotinic acetylcholine receptors participates in hippocampal synaptic transmission as well as in learning and memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Kenney1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Levin2">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-MartiBarros1">[88]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-FernandezdeSevilla1">[89]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049998-Hasselmo1">[90]</xref>.

In this sense, a possible role of D-serine was not considered. Nevertheless, it cannot be excluded that astrocytes may use different mechanisms to modulate synaptic plasticity induced in physiological conditions by acetylcholine, or by nicotine during smoking.
