        <p>In June 2007, a previously undescribed monkey known locally as “lesula” was found in the forests of the middle Lomami Basin in central Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). We describe this new species as <italic>Cercopithecus lomamiensis</italic> sp. nov., and provide data on its distribution, morphology, genetics, ecology and behavior. <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> is restricted to the lowland rain forests of central DRC between the middle Lomami and the upper Tshuapa Rivers. Morphological and molecular data confirm that <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> is distinct from its nearest congener, <italic>C. hamlyni</italic>, from which it is separated geographically by both the Congo (Lualaba) and the Lomami Rivers. <italic>C. lomamiensis,</italic> like <italic>C. hamlyni,</italic> is semi-terrestrial with a diet containing terrestrial herbaceous vegetation. The discovery of <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> highlights the biogeographic significance and importance for conservation of central Congo’s interfluvial TL2 region, defined from the upper Tshuapa River through the Lomami Basin to the Congo (Lualaba) River. The TL2 region has been found to contain a high diversity of anthropoid primates including three forms, in addition to <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic>, that are endemic to the area. We recommend the common name, lesula, for this new species, as it is the vernacular name used over most of its known range.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Discoveries of new African primate species are rare but significant events that clarify taxonomic and evolutionary relationships and highlight important regions of biodiversity for conservation. Here we report the scientific discovery of a new primate species, <italic>Cercopithecus lomamiensis</italic>, sp. nov., found during field surveys in a remote area of the middle Lomami Basin in central Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044271-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> represents only the second new species of African monkey to be discovered in the past 28 years. The new species is a member of the tribe Cercopithecini, commonly referred to as guenons, which represents the most speciose clade of extant African primates. Guenons are endemic to sub-Saharan Africa and occupy a range of habitats from wooded savannas to closed forest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044271-Butynski1">[1]</xref>. The highest diversity of guenons occurs in closed forests in Central and West Africa where species utilize different canopy levels, including the forest floor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044271-Thomas1">[2]</xref>, and exhibit considerable dietary flexibility, exploiting a diversity of leaf-, insect- and fruit-eating rainforest niches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044271-Chapman1">[3]</xref>. Geographical and behavioral barriers have been potentially important in guenon speciation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044271-Colyn1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044271-Kingdon1">[5]</xref>, and the distribution and relationship of species in related clades provides insight into the biogeographic history of Central African faunas and the evolution of key behavioral and ecological traits.</p>

Outside of DRC, <italic>C. hamlyni</italic> occurs only at Nyungwe Forest National Park, Rwanda. The TL2 region extends from the upper Tshuapa River, across the Lomami River to the Lualaba River.

      <p>In this paper, we describe and name the new guenon species and discuss its relationship with its nearest congener and sister species, <italic>Cercopithecus hamlyni</italic>. This discovery adds a new species to the previously monotypic and poorly known <italic>hamlyni</italic> species group, and expands our understanding of this unique, semi-terrestrial lineage within the guenon radiation. It furthermore highlights the biogeographic significance and importance for conservation of the eastern interfluvial region of the Congo River’s central basin, known as the TL2 landscape, from the upper Tshuapa through the Lomami River Basin to the Congo (Lualaba) River (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044271-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). This previously little surveyed forest region is shown to have high taxonomic richness and endemism of anthropoid primates and represents an important area for conservation of Central African forest faunas.</p>

        <title>1. Ethics Statement</title>
        <p>The Congolese Wildlife Authority (Institut Congolais pour la Conservation de la Nature, ICCN) issued permits to the TL2 (Tshuapa, Lomami, and Lualaba) Project for all sites where biological samples and field observations were made. The ICCN is the governmental authority that has jurisdiction over the wildlife of this territory. Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) approval was not required for the noninvasive behavioral observations and biological samples of wild monkeys used in this study. IACUC protocols were followed for the collection of one skin snip specimen from a captive monkey. For the specimens collected from hunted animals, we obtained approval from the hunters to use these samples and no animal was hunted for the purpose of research. We acquired specimens only opportunistically in villages outside of the forest and we did not request samples from all lesula available to avoid targeting this species. When we encountered captive monkeys in villages, we photographed them with permission from the owner. We advised owners on the monkeys’ care and discouraged owners to acquire wild animals as captives. All the necessary exportation and importation permits were acquired by CITES, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services.</p>

        <title>2. Specimens Examined</title>
        <p>Seven specimens of <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> and eight specimens of <italic>C. hamlyni</italic> were used for analyses and descriptions of <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> and <italic>C. hamlyni</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044271.s005">Tables S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044271.s006">S2</xref>). Specimens collected in the field included freshly killed animals acquired from local hunters, animals killed by predators (including kills by leopards, <italic>Panthera pardus</italic>, or crowned eagles, <italic>Stephanoaetus coronatus</italic>) and one skin snip from a monkey captured locally and kept as a captive in a village near the species’ range. We used GPS to record locations where specimens were recovered in the field; when exact location of specimen origin was not possible (e.g., location based on hunter reporting), locations were estimated to the nearest settlement or geographic feature. We took information on the provenance, history and care of all captive animals seen. We took photographs of all specimens and captives, and recorded standard field measurements (total length, tail length, length of hind foot, length of ear pinnae, and body mass) wherever possible. Duplicates of tissue samples were stored in RNA<italic>later</italic> (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and 95% ethanol and stored in the field in cool, dark locations until transferred to the laboratory.</p>
        <p>All <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> skin and skeletal specimens are housed in the Yale Peabody Museum (YPM), New Haven, CT. Adult <italic>C. hamlyni</italic> specimens were examined at the YPM and the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), New York, NY. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044271.s005">Table S1</xref> for details on the specimens examined.</p>

      <sec id="s2c">
        <title>3. Morphology</title>

In addition to standard caliper measurements, we used 3-D geometric morphometric techniques to compare cranial shape of <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> and <italic>C. hamlyni</italic>. The 23 landmarks chosen to capture the overall shape of the cranium are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044271.s009">Table S5</xref> and include Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 landmarks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044271-Slice1">[6]</xref>; these landmarks included those used by Fleagle <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044271-Fleagle1">[7]</xref> in their larger study of primate cranial diversity, and additional cranial landmarks deemed to be repeatable and informative.</p>
        <p>We digitized the landmarks on each cranium using a Microscribe G2X digitizer (Immersion Corp). The individual crania were immobilized in a bed of Play-Doh, and the landmarks were digitized in two sets–one superior view and one inferior view. All bilateral landmarks were digitized on the right side of the cranium. As reference points, five landmarks were digitized in both views. Subsequently, the two sets of landmarks were combined using the program DVLR v. 0.4.9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044271-Raaum1">[8]</xref> to obtain a single set of 23 three-dimensional coordinates for each cranium. We imported the landmark data into the software package Morphologika <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044271-OHiggins1">[9]</xref>, and performed a Procrustes superimposition analysis on the entire sample of <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> (n = 3) and <italic>C. hamlyni</italic> (n = 7) crania. We then used a principal components analysis (PCA) of the Procrustes superimposition to identify the major axes of cranial shape among all of the crania.

          <p>We used a phylogenetic analysis in a comparative context to address the question of species vs subspecies status for the <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> individuals. If the divergence date calculated between the <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> lineage and its sister lineage is equal to, or greater than, estimates calculated between recognized species within other cercopithecin species groups, it provides a strong argument for equivalent species-level status of the <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> lineage. The TSPY and X-datasets were not combined for these analyses. X- and Y-loci differ in significant parameters, including effective population size and mode of inheritance, and are therefore known to follow unique evolutionary trajectories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044271-Avise1">[17]</xref>. Moreover, earlier studies have shown that while the X-locus surveyed here is evolving in a clock-like fashion in cercopithecins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044271-Tosi1">[11]</xref>, the TSPY gene is not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044271-Tosi3">[18]</xref>.</p>
          <p>The novel TSPY and Xq13.3 homolog sequences of <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> and <italic>C. hamlyni</italic> were each added to datasets consisting of sequences of other cercopithecids taken from GenBank (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044271.s006">Table S2</xref>). Both datasets were aligned with ClustalW2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044271-Larkin1">[19]</xref> and checked by eye. Novel sequences developed in this study were archived in GenBank (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044271.s006">Table S2</xref>). Alignments for each gene are provided in Matrix S1 and S2 as fully executable Nexus files. Appropriate models of molecular evolution were inferred using hierarchical likelihood ratio tests implemented in MODELTEST 3.6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044271-Posada1">[20]</xref>. The HKY + G model with an alpha value of 0.7748 was inferred for TSPY; TrN + G with an alpha value of 0.9416 was estimated for Xq13.3 homolog.</p>
          <p>Maximum likelihood analyses using the appropriate models of molecular evolution were conducted first using PAUP* 4.0b10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044271-Swofford1">[21]</xref> and then GARLI 0.951 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044271-Zwickl1">[22]</xref>, with 50 and 500 bootstrap replicates, respectively. <italic>Trachypithecus cristatus</italic> was used as the outgroup for the TSPY analysis, and <italic>T. obscurus</italic> for Xq13.3 homolog. GARLI allows much more rapid estimation of likelihood values and was therefore used to generate higher numbers of bootstrap replicates.

Vocalization surveys were conducted at a total of 117 survey posts distributed systematically in six, 30 km×30 km blocks that had been previously selected for intensive large mammal inventories (18–22 vocalization surveys per block).

Listening posts were always ≥200 m from survey bivouac camps. Observers arrived at listening posts before first light and remained quiet and concealed during the survey. Observers recorded the species, time, compass direction, and relative distance of the calls for all primates heard between 06∶00–06∶30 in one of three distance categories: <italic>proximate</italic>: callers or their movements seen from the listening post; <italic>far</italic>: callers not visible but calls had high clarity and amplitude; and <italic>remote</italic>: all other discernible calls.

          <p>We collected data on <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> behavior on a pre-established path grid that totaled 64 km in the Losekola Study Area. We collected data over four sampling periods lasting from 10 days to three weeks from March 2008 to April 2010. Surveys were conducted in an area of diverse mature upland forest types bisected by small streams with no recent history of human settlement and little previous incidence of hunting. The Losekola Study Area was protected from all hunting since January 2008.</p>
          <p>During survey periods, data were collected daily, from 6∶30 to 14∶00 by two experienced observers moving along the area’s permanent transect grid. Observers recorded the time and GPS waypoint for all primate groups encountered (seen and heard, or heard but not seen). For groups that were seen, we estimated the perpendicular distance from the estimated center of each to the transect line, counted the number of animals seen by species, and estimated the number of additional animals that could not be counted accurately. For groups that were heard but not seen, we recorded the occurrence of species based on vocalizations.</p>
          <p>For each encounter with <italic>C. lomamiensis,</italic> observers noted the canopy position (vegetation stratum) and behavior of each visible animal when it was first detected. Stratum height position was recorded as: ground  = 0 m; understory  =  &gt;0 m and &lt;3 m; mid-story  = 3–20 m; canopy  =  &gt;20 m. Behavior was recorded as stationary, including grooming and resting; feeding, including both ingesting and searching for food; slow movement, defined as movement where foraging was not detected; and rapid movement or flight. Animals still visible after 3 minutes were scanned a second time for position and behavior.</p>

        <title>1. Discovery</title>
        <p>The scientific discovery of <italic>Cercopithecus lomamiensis</italic> was made in June 2007 when field teams saw a captive juvenile female of an unknown species at the residence of the primary school director in the town of Opala (S 0.50721°, E 24.22713°). The school director identified the animal as a “lesula” a vernacular name we had not recorded before, and said that it is well known by local hunters. He reported that he acquired the infant about two months earlier from a family member who had killed its mother in the forest near Yawende, south of Opala and west of the Lomami River (S 0.99772°, E 24.29810°). We took photographs of the animal and made arrangements for its care. We observed and photographed this animal regularly over the next 18 months.</p>
        <p>Subsequent searches in Opala and in the Yawende area turned up other male and female captive juvenile lesula; all were photographed and some monitored for several months afterwards. Our first observation of the species in the wild was in the Obenge area (S 1.38461°, E 25.03749°) in December 2007 where the species is well known by local hunters.</p>

          <title>Description</title>
          <p>A medium sized, long-limbed monkey with a slender body. Naked facial skin, eyelids, and ear pinnae vary from pale pinkish gray to tannish brown. Buff diadem and vertical cream nose stripe are variably present. Chin, throat, and upper ventrum are yellowish buff, contrasting with black lower ventrum and abdomen. Skin and pelage on shoulder and forelimb are black. Hair over the entire dorsum is banded buff or amber with black. Typically, the base of the hair grades from white to gray to black and then exhibits 3–4 bands of buff/amber as one moves up the hair distally/dorsally. Anterior 2/3 of the dorsum, including head and mane, is buff, grading into amber over posterior third of dorsum and onto base of tail. Distinctively, there is a prominent amber median stripe on the distal half to one-third of the dorsum. The amber banding is restricted to the medial portion of the posterior third to half of the dorsum (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044271-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Laterally there is buff banding similar to the buff banding on the proximal half to two-thirds of the dorsum. The proximal half of the thigh is characterized by silvery-gray hairs, slightly lighter than color 86 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044271-Smithe1">[10]</xref>, while the rest of the leg (underside and distal half) is covered with black hairs. Proximal end of tail is amber, darkening distally and becoming completely black at its tip.</p>
          <p>Juveniles have a pale blond pelage overall, lightest on the throat and upper ventrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044271-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Vertical nose stripe is absent or reduced. The amber dorsal patch appears on the lower dorsum and base of the tail within the first three months. Dorsal and limb pelage darken progressively. One female followed from an estimated age of 3 months acquired adult pelage and full adult body size by about 15 months of age.</p>

          <p>Similarities in cranial, skin and pelage traits between <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> and <italic>C. hamlyni.</italic></p>
          <p>The cranium of <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> is similar to that of <italic>C. hamlyni</italic> in possessing a distinctive nasal profile (adult males, in particular) that distinguishes crania in this clade from other <italic>Cercopithecus</italic> species. On the basicranium, <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> and <italic>C. hamlyni</italic> both seem to exhibit distinctive and well-excavated fossae anterior to the foramen magnum (for longus capitis).</p>
          <p>The variably prominent white to cream colored vertical nose strip shared by <italic>C. hamlyni</italic> and <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> is found in no other <italic>Cercopithecus</italic> species. The pelage of both species includes hairs that are gray at the base with light and dark band pairs moving distally. The limbs of both species, including the back of the thighs and perianal region, are black with admixture of gray/silvery hairs. Males and females of both <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> and <italic>C. hamlyni</italic> have a prominent facial mane of elongated hairs on the cheeks and crown, a feature unique to these two species.</p>
          <p>The blue perineum, buttocks and scrotum displayed by adult males are comparable in size and coloration in <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> and <italic>C. hamlyni</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044271-g007">Fig. 7</xref>), and are more extensive than genital patches in any other <italic>Cercopithecus</italic>. It is comparable in extent to the buttocks and genital patch displayed in adult male mandrills (<italic>Mandrillus sphinx)</italic>.</p>
          <p>In both species, the juvenile is pale, uniformly colored and differs markedly from adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044271-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). The nose stripe is variably present in juveniles of both species, and is often absent or indistinct.</p>

        <title>Differences in Cranial, Skin and Pelage Traits between <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> and <italic>C. hamlyni</italic></title>
        <p>Overall, the olive-maned <italic>C. hamlyni</italic> is darker, more somber and less vividly marked than <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> whose grizzled blond mane, prominent amber dorsal patch, and buff upper ventrum contrast with black legs and lower ventrum. The crown hairs of <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> are generally not offset by a contrasting diadem as is often seen in <italic>C. hamlyni</italic>. The pale facial skin and ear pinnae of <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> are distinguished from the dark facial skin and pinnae of <italic>C. hamlyni.</italic> The nose stripe is typically a yellowish/cream color and often indistinct in <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> rather than the clear white of <italic>C. hamlyni.</italic> Typically, there are 3–4 bands on the dorsum hairs of <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> and 4–5 bands on the hairs of <italic>C. hamlyni</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044271-Groves1">[28]</xref>. The gray/silver hairs on the thighs of <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> do not extend as far distally as in <italic>C. hamlyni</italic>. The tail of <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> is amber at its base, black over most of its length and lacks a terminal tail tuft. The tail of <italic>C. hamlyni</italic> is gray from the base to over 3/4 of its length and is only black at its tufted terminal tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044271-g004">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
        <p>The juvenile pelage of <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> is distinctively paler and blonder than that of <italic>C. hamlyni</italic>. Juvenile <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> have pale facial skin in contrast to the darker facial skin of <italic>C. hamlyni</italic>, and they show the beginnings of the amber dorsal patch even when immature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044271-g006">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>
        <p>The cranium of <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> is most obviously distinguished from <italic>C. hamlyni</italic> by its significantly larger orbits, greater degree of occipital flexion, narrower interorbital breadth, and narrower calvarium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044271-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044271.s008">Table S4</xref>). <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> has significantly larger incisors, upper and lower M2s, and upper M3s than <italic>C. hamlyni</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044271.s008">Table S4</xref>). In addition, a distinct bump or prominence is typically present at or around nasion in <italic>C. hamlyni</italic>, but is absent in the type specimen of <italic>C. lomamiensis.</italic></p>

        <title>4. Vocalizations</title>
        <p>The dawn boom chorus is the most conspicuous vocalization of both <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> and <italic>C. hamlyni</italic> and the only call regularly heard in free-ranging animals. We consistently heard booms of <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> around dawn and very little during the remainder of the day. We heard occasional booms by <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> at night, most often shortly after dark. Though we did not identify the sex of callers, they were almost certainly male; several other <italic>Cercopithecus</italic> species (e.g., <italic>C. campbelli</italic>, <italic>C. neglectus</italic>, <italic>C. mitis</italic>, <italic>C. wolfi</italic>) make similar boom calls utilizing a laryngeal air sac that is substantially larger in males and in no species do females produce such a call <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044271-Gautier1">[29]</xref>. We collected 49 useable recordings of ‘descending booms’ by <italic>C. hamlyni</italic> (n = 43) and <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> (n = 6). No other call types were recorded. Exemplars of booms by <italic>C. hamlyni</italic> and <italic>C. lomamiensis,</italic> filtered for calls of birds and insects and other ambient sounds are provided in Audio S1 and S2.</p>
        <p>The booms of <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> and <italic>C. hamlyni</italic> are low frequency, tonal calls clearly distinguished from booms in other <italic>Cercopithecus</italic> species by their longer duration and descending frequency from beginning to end. In both species, booms were given in bouts of 2–3 calls and different animals often called in overlapping sequences, suggesting contagion or potentially antiphonal calling. The booms of both species consist of a single dominant frequency band with no discernible harmonic overtones or formants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044271-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). Booms have a mean starting frequency of 215 Hz in <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> and 205 Hz in <italic>C. hamlyni</italic> and a mean end frequency of 199 Hz in <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> and 188 Hz in <italic>C. hamlyni</italic>. Call duration averaged 0.35 sec in <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> and 0.37 sec in <italic>C. hamlyni</italic>.</p>
        <p>The calls differed significantly (Welch Two Sample t-test, n = 49, p&lt;0.05) on two of 16 measured acoustic parameters: High frequency and 3<sup>rd</sup> Quartile Frequency Differences. Three other parameters (End Frequency, Start Frequency, and 1<sup>st</sup> Quartile Frequency) were nearly significant (range: p = 0.054–0.065) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044271.s012">Table S8</xref>).</p>

        <title>5. Ecology</title>
        <p>We found <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> in mature upland evergreen humid forests, including mixed forests and forests dominated by <italic>Gilbertiodendron dewevrei</italic>. We recorded <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> less often in regenerating forests around settlements. We never recorded <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> in seasonally inundated forests or in the gallery forests in the savannas south of the main forest block.</p>
        <p><italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> is shy and was the least frequently seen of all primates recorded on large mammal surveys (19 observations of <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> out of a total of 223 visual observations of primate groups). Vocalization surveys indicate that <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> is more abundant than visual sightings on transects would suggest. We recorded <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> boom calls at 34 of 70 dawn listening posts surveyed within the species’ known range between the Lomami and upper Tshuapa Rivers. We surveyed an additional 47 listening posts outside the known range, east of the Lomami River and west of the Tshuapa River and recorded no <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> vocalizations.</p>
        <p>Multiple individuals were recorded calling at 27 of 34 (79.4%) sites where <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> vocalizations were heard. Of the 27 posts with multiple animals calling, two vocalizing individuals were recorded at 17 posts; three vocalizing individuals were recorded at 4 posts; 4 vocalizing individuals at 5 posts; and 5 vocalizing individuals were recorded at one post. When multiple animals vocalized, it was not possible to determine if the animals belonged to different groups or were members of a single dispersed group. Of 78 calling individuals, five callers were classed as proximate. Two proximate vocalizing animals were seen on the ground; three others were detected by moving vegetation, either on the ground or in the understory. All other vocalizing animals were classed as far or remote.</p>
        <p>We found no evidence for seasonal variation in calling rates; however, we found marked differences in the occurrence of calling in different portions of the species known range. We recorded vocalizations at 11 of 40 (27.5%) listening points in the southern third of the range. In contrast, vocalizing animals were recorded at 16 of 19 listening points in the region of the Losekola Study Area and at 8 of 11 listening points in the northern portion of the species range. These latter two locations are in the Tutu River basin, a tributary of the Lomami River. These apparent differences in occurrence of <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> may be due to habitat differences in the areas surveyed. The southern range has lower rainfall with a pronounced dry season and a higher frequency of savanna ecotone, where lesula were never recorded. Closed evergreen forests dominate the northern range of <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic>, including the Tutu River basin.</p>

        <p>We observed 48 individual <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> during 19 encounters (1–5 individuals per encounter), with only a single animal seen in 8 of the encounters. In 11 encounters, <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> were seen associated with other primate species (<italic>C. mona wolfi</italic>, <italic>C. ascanius katangae</italic>, <italic>Procolobus badius tholloni</italic>). Of the 48 animals seen, 17 (35%) were on the ground when first encountered.</p>
        <p>Fourteen animals fled at or subsequent to encounter. Nine animals fled on the ground including three individuals that descended to the ground from the understory or middle level stratum to flee. Of the five animals fleeing in the strata above ground, only one climbed from the ground to flee. One animal first seen in the canopy fled laterally to a second canopy and then became stationary. In the other three observations, animals located above the ground fled in the same stratum in which they were first encountered.</p>
        <p>Animals were recorded feeding or foraging on eight first encounters totaling 26 individuals. In five observations of feeding (20 animals total) <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> were associated with other primate species; in three encounters (6 animals total) <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> were in a monospecific group or only a single animal was seen. Eleven of the 26 individuals observed feeding were feeding on the ground. In two encounters of multi-species associations, we observed <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> feeding on the ground on food parts dropped by primates foraging above them in the middle story and canopy. We observed <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> feed on leaf petioles, ripe and unripe fruit parts, flower buds, and the meristems of two species of terrestrial herbaceous Marantaceae.</p>
        <p>We made one exceptional observation of an apparent attack by a crowned eagle (<italic>Stephanoaetus coronatus</italic>) on a lesula. One of our survey leaders saw an eagle fly off at close range in mid story. We approached the site and saw a <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> alive but wounded lying in a tree crotch. We watched the site for 37 minutes but the eagle did not return. At that point, the monkey, a subadult female, died and fell out of the tree and the animal was collected (specimen YPM 14192).</p>

        <p>Morphological and genetic analyses support the species designation of <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> and place it with <italic>C. hamlyni</italic> in a lineage divergent from related clades of <italic>Cercopithecus</italic>. Phenotypic and behavioral traits that are shared by <italic>C. hamlyni</italic> and <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> and that are found in no other <italic>Cercopithecus</italic> species include a distinctive skull shape, prominent facial mane of elongated hairs on the cheeks and crown found in both sexes, variably white to cream colored vertical nose stripe, large bright blue patch complete with a blue scrotum on the perineum and buttocks in adult males, and dawn boom chorus. A pale, uniformly colored juvenile pelage differing markedly from adults is found in both <italic>C. hamlyni</italic> and <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> and is shared with <italic>C. neglectus.</italic> Among forest living guenons, <italic>C. hamlyni</italic> and <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> share semi-terrestrial locomotion with the <italic>lhoesti</italic> species group (<italic>Allochrocebus lhoesti, A. preussi</italic>, and <italic>A. solatus</italic>) and <italic>C. neglectus</italic>. <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> also shares a similar diet with the <italic>lhoesti</italic> group in which terrestrial herbaceous vegetation is an important component.</p>
        <p>Both <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> and <italic>C. hamlyni</italic> are shy, quiet, and generally occur in small groups, though larger, possibly temporary associations have been reported for <italic>C. hamlyni</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044271-Hart1">[31]</xref>. The range of both species is primarily in lowland evergreen tropical forest, although <italic>C. hamlyni</italic> has a larger geographic distribution, occurs across a larger range of altitudes, and utilizes a wider range of habitats, including a variety of montane formations. A similar pattern of speciation in which related species with disjunct ranges and marked genetic and morphological differentiation share common ecological and behavioral traits is seen in the <italic>A. lhoesti</italic> species group. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0044271-t001">Table 1</xref> provides a summary comparison of distribution, behavior and ecology of <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> and <italic>C. hamlyni</italic>.</p>

        <title>2. Biogeography of the <italic>C. hamlyni–C. lomamiensis</italic> Clade</title>
        <p>Speciation in African primates has been linked to Pleistocene forest refugia, riverine barriers, and transitional environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044271-Colyn2">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044271-Harcourt1">[36]</xref>. Pleistocene forest refugia were probably not responsible for the divergence of the <italic>C. hamlyni–C. lomamiensis</italic> clade given the estimated molecular divergence dates near the Pliocene<italic>–</italic>Pleistocene boundary. Instead, biogeographic barriers likely played a role in speciation in the group. <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> and <italic>C. hamlyni</italic> are separated by two major rivers, the Congo (Lualaba) and the Lomami. Both arise south of the equatorial forest zone and are significant barriers to dispersal of forest faunas. The absence of any member of this clade in the Lomami<italic>–</italic>Lualaba interfluve may reflect inability of these primates to survive in the environments prevalent in much of this region. Particularly in the southern interfluve area, seasonally inundated forests are interspersed with sterile short grass savannas underlain by podzolic soils with a high water table <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044271-Sys1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044271-Young1">[38]</xref>. Other forest taxa, notably okapi (<italic>Okapia johnstoni</italic>) and red colobus (<italic>Procolobus rufomitratus</italic>) with populations east of the Lualaba and west of the Lomami are also absent from these areas of the interfluve region.</p>

        <title>3. Conservation</title>
        <p><italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> is not uncommon over its range of at least 17,000 km<sup>2</sup>. The species likely remained unknown because the TL2 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044271-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), which includes the lesula’s range, was not well explored biologically until recently. The discovery of <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> has established the importance of the TL2 region for conservation. Surveys have confirmed and extended preliminary information on the occurrence of a number of forest taxa in the region, notably anthropoid primates. The TL2 region has 11 species or distinctive subspecies of anthropoid primates. Four taxa are endemic to the TL2 region: the lesula, Lomami River red colobus (<italic>Procolobus badius parmentieri</italic>), Lomami River blue monkey (<italic>Cercopithecus mitis heymansi</italic>), and Kasuku River Wolf’s monkey (<italic>Cercopithecus wolfi elegans</italic>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0044271-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>

        <p>At present, TL2 remains remote from human expansion, and there is no logging or mining. Hunting is the immediate threat to the faunas of TL2. We provide a provisional IUCN Red List Assessment of Vulnerable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044271-IUCN1">[39]</xref> for <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> based on the inferred population decline from uncontrolled bushmeat hunting. This has expanded into the species’ range over the last decade driven by the urban bushmeat markets of Kindu and Kisangani <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044271-Hart2">[40]</xref>. For species with restricted ranges and reliance on primary forest, such as <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic>, uncontrolled hunting can lead to catastrophic declines over a short period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044271-Struhsaker1">[41]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The conservation of <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic> urgently requires controls on hunting along with the creation of a protected area. A core zone of 9000 km<sup>2</sup> in the TL2 region is proposed as the Lomami National Park (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044271-Hart3">[42]</xref> for documentation of the gazettement process). The proposed protected area, along with the existing Réserve Naturelle de Sankuru, will cover most of the known range of <italic>C. lomamiensis</italic>. While the establishment of the new protected area is a necessary first step, active protection and monitoring are required to ensure the conservation of the lesula and other unique biodiversity of the eastern rim of Congo’s central basin.</p>
