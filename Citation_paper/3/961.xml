        <p>Replication of retroviral and host genomes requires ribonucleotide reductase to convert rNTPs to dNTPs, which are then used as substrates for DNA synthesis. Inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase by hydroxyurea (HU) has been previously used to treat cancers as well as HIV. However, the use of HU as an antiretroviral is limited by its associated toxicities such as myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity. In this study, we examined the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, gemcitabine, both in cell culture and in C57Bl/6 mice infected with LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus (LP-BM5 MuLV, a murine AIDS model). Gemcitabine decreased infectivity of MuLV in cell culture with an EC50 in the low nanomolar range with no detectable cytotoxicity. Similarly, gemcitabine significantly decreased disease progression in mice infected with LP-BM5. Specifically, gemcitabine treatment decreased spleen size, plasma IgM, and provirus levels compared to LP-BM5 MuLV infected, untreated mice. Gemcitabine efficacy was observed at doses as low as 1 mg/kg/day in the absence of toxicity. Higher doses of gemcitabine (3 mg/kg/day and higher) were associated with toxicity as determined by a loss in body mass. In summary, our findings demonstrate that gemcitabine has antiretroviral activity ex vivo and in vivo in the LP-BM5 MuLV model. These observations together with a recent ex vivo study with HIV-1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015840-Clouser1">[1]</xref>, suggest that gemcitabine has broad antiretroviral activity and could be particularly useful in vivo when used in combination drug therapy.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Retroviruses are a significant source of morbidity and mortality worldwide. For example, there are 33 million people infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) whereas the retrovirus, xenotropic murine leukemia virus like-virus (XMRV), has recently been proposed to be linked to prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015840-Lombardi1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015840-Urisman1">[3]</xref>. Although there are a number of drugs available for HIV-1 chemotherapy, the efficacy of these treatments is limited by the emergence of drug resistance, cost of treatment, and off-target effects. These limitations necessitate the development of new drugs and novel drug targets for HIV as well as other retroviruses. Similarly, if XMRV is shown to be the etiological agent of either prostate cancer and/or CFS, the development of new drugs could reduce morbidity and mortality.</p>
      <p>Current anti-retroviral drugs target viral proteins that are necessary for viral replication and production. Under suboptimal therapy, the combination of both the high rates of replication and mutation leads to the emergence of drug resistance. Although drugs that target host proteins could delay or prevent the emergence of drug resistance, there are significant side effects associated with inhibiting host proteins. While cellular deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) are necessary for host cell function, even small changes in dNTP pools appear to affect viral replication without significant cellular toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015840-Bebenek1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Previous studies have shown that hydroxyurea, which inhibits the cellular enzyme ribonucleotide reductase effectively decreases replication of HIV-1 and was recently shown to also inhibit hepatitis C virus replication as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015840-Lori1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015840-Nozaki1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015840-MayhewCN1">[7]</xref>. Nonetheless, several factors make hydroxyurea undesirable as an antiviral including 1) pharmacokinetics of hydroxyurea vary from person to person making its plasma levels unpredictable and 2) significant toxicities (pancreatitis, hepatotoxicity) are associated with the use of hydroxyurea when used to treat HIV-1 infection. The toxicity of hydroxyurea is further emphasized in the murine AIDS (MAIDS) model in which all animals treated with hydroxyurea died from drug-related toxicities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015840-Mayhew1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Alternatives to hydroxyurea that have a more desirable pharmacokinetic profile and lower toxicity concerns may offer a new and useful treatment for retroviral infections. In fact, other ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors have been shown to be more effective and less toxic in the MAIDS model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015840-Mayhew2">[9]</xref>. However, no follow up studies have been published regarding their potential for clinical use.</p>
      <p>2′,2′-Difluoro-2′-deoxycytidine, commonly referred to as gemcitabine represents a potential alternative to hydroxyurea as it has been shown to have two mechanisms of action including inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015840-Heinemann1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015840-Wong1">[11]</xref>. Gemcitabine is clinically-approved for cancer therapy and its anti-cancer mechanism is attributed to its ability to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase thereby limiting dNTP pools available for DNA synthesis in cancer cells. Since retroviruses may be more sensitive to dNTP pool alterations than cellular polymerases, we hypothesized that gemcitabine would be an alternative to hydroxyurea that could be translated to clinical use for the treatment of retroviral infections when used in combination with current anti-retroviral therapies.</p>
      <p>In a recent study, we identified two clinically-approved drugs, decitabine and gemcitabine, that had potent anti-HIV activity in cell culture. The potency by which gemcitabine inhibited infectivity suggested that it may be useful for the treatment of retroviral infections when used with decitabine or in combination with current antiretroviral therapies.</p>
      <p>In this study, we examined the ability of gemcitabine to inhibit replication of another retrovirus, murine leukemia virus in cell culture. Additionally, we examined the efficacy and toxicity of gemcitabine in vivo using LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus (LP-BM5 MuLV, a murine AIDS model). We chose this animal model as it has been used extensively to screen potential anti-HIV drugs and has been validated with a number of clinically approved anti-HIV drugs such as AZT and PMPA (tenofovir) that have relatively broad antiretroviral activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015840-Dias1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015840-Ohnota1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015840-Rossi1">[14]</xref>. In this study, we show that gemcitabine decreased infectivity of MuLV in cell culture with no detectable cytotoxicity. Similarly, gemcitabine decreased disease progression in the MAIDS model at non-toxic doses although toxicities were detected at doses just three times that of the effective dose. Our findings, along with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015840-Clouser1">[1]</xref>), indicate that gemcitabine has relatively broad antiretroviral activity with minimal toxicity and could be useful for in vivo antiretroviral combination therapy.</p>

        <title>Gemcitabine inhibits MuLV in cell culture</title>
        <p>Before examining the antiviral activity of gemcitabine <italic>in vivo</italic>, we first examined the ability of gemcitabine to inhibit MuLV in cell culture. To do this, a GFP-tagged MuLV was pseudotyped with VSV-G and used to infect target cells that had been pretreated with increasing concentrations of gemcitabine. Flow cytometry was then used to determine the percentage of infected cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015840-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, gemcitabine potently decreased MuLV infectivity in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 in the low nM range. Additionally, there was no toxicity seen at the concentrations of gemcitabine needed to inhibit viral replication when the cells were exposed to gemcitabine for the same time as was used to assess gemcitabine's effect on infectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015840-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

        <p>Proliferation of lymphoid cells in the spleen contributes to the splenomegaly observed in mice infected with LP-BM5 and is an indicator of disease progression and disease severity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015840-Yetter1">[18]</xref>. To determine if gemcitabine decreases splenomegaly, spleens were obtained and weighed at the time of sacrifice. As expected, the ratio of spleen to body weight was significantly increased in infected animals that did not receive treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015840-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Mice treated with 1 or 2 mg/kg/day had an average ratio of spleen to body weight that was significantly lower than the infected, untreated mice. In fact, there was no significant difference in the spleen to body weight ratio between the treated mice and those that were not infected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015840-g002">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>

        <p>Since gemcitabine significantly decreased spleen size in mice infected with LP-BM5, we next examined whether the decrease in spleen size correlated with a decrease in the histopathological changes characteristic of MAIDS. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0015840-t002">Table 2</xref> demonstrates that there were no significant findings in spleen from two of the four uninfected mice. The spleens of the other two uninfected mice were identified as either reactive or as having a score of 1 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for scoring system). Of all other groups, the infected, untreated mice had the most severe lesions as the spleens from all four of the mice in this group received a score of 2 or higher, indicating extensive changes in splenic architecture and significant expansion of lymphoid cells. In general, there was a decrease in splenic lesion score as the dose of administered gemcitabine increased. For example, all spleens from mice receiving the highest dose of gemcitabine were normal, while 5 of the 6 mice in the 3 mg/kg/day treatment group had spleens with no significant findings and 4 of the 6 mice in the 2 mg/kg/day treatment group were within normal limits. Finally, 1 of the 7 mice from the 1 mg/kg/day treatment group had a spleen with normal histology while the other 6 spleens received a score of 1, indicating mild lesions.</p>

        <p>Infection with LP-BM5 destroys the architecture of lymph nodes and alters the composition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015840-Yetter1">[18]</xref>. When detected, the lymph nodes from infected or uninfected mice were examined by histopathology as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> section. Lymph nodes were only detectable in one of the four uninfected mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0015840-t003">Table 3</xref>). These lymph nodes were scored as a 1, indicating an enlargement of the lymph nodes with diffuse sheets of medium to large lymphoid cells while maintaining corticomedullary architecture. Consistent with the spleen data, the size and lesions of the lymph nodes was greatest in mice that were infected but not treated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0015840-t003">Table 3</xref>). Additionally, lymph nodes became more difficult to detect as the dose of gemcitabine increased, indicating that gemcitabine decreased the extent of lymph node enlargement. Consistent with this, the pathology of lymph nodes from mice treated with the higher doses of gemcitabine had lower scores indicating less severe lesions. For example, 6 of the 7 mice treated with 1 mg/kg/day of gemcitabine received a score of 1, whereas all of the lymph nodes from mice treated with either 2 or 3 mg/kg/day received scores that were consistent with a decrease in disease progression when compared to the untreated but infected mice or mice treated with 1 mg/kg/day of gemcitabine.</p>

        <title>Effect of gemcitabine on plasma IgM levels</title>
        <p>Soon after infection with LP-BM5, mice demonstrate a significant increase in plasma IgM levels that peak approximately 8–9 weeks post-infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015840-Pattengale1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015840-Yetter1">[18]</xref>.

To examine the effect of gemcitabine on IgM levels, plasma was isolated from whole blood collected from mice at the time of sacrifice. As expected, infected but untreated animals demonstrated a significant increase in IgM levels compared to the uninfected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015840-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). In contrast, treatment with 1 or 2 mg/kg/day of gemcitabine significantly decreased IgM levels compared to the untreated animals.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the absence of a cure or vaccine for HIV-1 infection, the identification of novel drug targets and the development of new drugs is the best approach to address the emergence of resistance as well as the complications associated with current therapies. Drugs that target cellular proteins are less likely to be susceptible to the emergence of drug resistance compared to the current anti-HIV therapies which target viral proteins. However, drugs that target cellular proteins are likely to be associated with an increase in toxicity which may limit their clinical use. For example, hydroxyurea has been used alone and in combination with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) to decrease viral loads in HIV-1 infected individuals. The side effects associated with hydroxyurea has significantly curtailed its clinical use. Less toxic alternatives to hydroxyurea would offer important alternatives for the treatment of HIV-1 as well as other retroviral infections.</p>
      <p>A recent study demonstrated that two clinically approved drugs, decitabine and gemcitabine have potent anti-HIV activity in cell culture when used alone or in combination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015840-Clouser1">[1]</xref>. Importantly, based on gemcitabine's potency and lack of toxicity, the data suggest that gemcitabine may be a clinically relevant alternative to hydroxyurea for the treatment of retroviral infections.</p>
      <p>In this study, we examined the antiretroviral activity of gemcitabine in vivo and ex vivo using the LP-BM5 MuLV model (a murine AIDS model). Murine AIDS is caused by a combination of three murine leukemia viruses including BM5-eco, BM5def, and mink cell focus inducing virus (MCF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015840-Chattopadhyay1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015840-Chattopadhyay2">[21]</xref>. BM5def is a retrovirus that is unable to replicate due to deletion of most of the pol gene. However, its intact gag gene is thought to be responsible for MAIDS pathogenesis. Although LP-BM5 is not a perfect model for AIDS pathogenesis, it is well characterized, safe, inexpensive, and has been validated with a number of clinically approved anti-HIV-1 drugs and has been useful for identifying drugs with broad antiretroviral activity (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015840-Dias1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our studies found that gemcitabine decreased replication of MuLV in cell culture as well as in vivo using the MAIDS model. In fact, all measures of MAIDS-associated pathogenesis including splenomegaly, histopathology of spleen and lymph nodes and levels of IgM and provirus indicated reduced viral replication. The reduction of provirus by gemcitabine further supported the gemcitabine-mediated reduction in viral replication. There are at least two mechanisms that could account for the decrease in disease progression. First, gemcitabine could decrease dNTP levels enough to decrease proliferation of infected cells. Second, gemcitabine could alter dNTP levels such that viral replication is inhibited without inhibition of cellular proliferation. These mechanisms are likely to be dose dependent with low gemcitabine doses preferentially inhibiting viral replication and higher doses inhibiting both viral replication and cell proliferation. In support of this, 2 mg/kg/day of gemcitabine caused a significant reduction in IgM levels compared to the uninfected animals. This is likely due to gemcitabine-mediated decrease in B cell proliferation. In contrast, IgM levels from mice treated with 1 mg/kg/day had levels comparable to the uninfected animals which suggest there was not a significant reduction in B cell numbers compared to the uninfected mice. The cell culture data also supported this assertion as the decrease in replication was not associated with a significant loss of cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015840-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). These data indicate that gemcitabine's antiviral activity is distinct from its activity used to treat human cancers. Furthermore, doses of gemcitabine used clinically in cancer treatment are significantly higher than those used in our study. For example, gemcitabine's anti-cancer activity is achieved with a dosing regimen that includes 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> given once every week for seven weeks, followed by one week without drug and additional rounds of treatment as needed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015840-Sakamoto1">[22]</xref>. In our study, an antiviral effect was seen in animals at doses as low as 1 mg/kg which correlates to 3 mg/m<sup>2</sup> when using the BSA method to convert the mouse dose to the human equivalent dose (mouse dose multiplied by mouse km of 3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015840-ReaganShaw1">[23]</xref>. Although the metabolism of gemcitabine in mice is likely different compared to humans, the significant difference in dosing further supports that the antiviral activity seen here is not due to inhibition of cell proliferation.</p>
      <p>Toxicity of gemcitabine was significant at higher doses. In fact, all mice treated with 3 and 4 mg/kg/day lost 15% or greater of their body weight during the study and as a result were prematurely euthanized. However, the 1 mg/kg/day dose of gemcitabine decreased disease pathology with no detectable toxicity. Specifically, all of these animals gained body weight similar to the uninfected animals. Additionally, these animals did not show any signs of hepatotoxicity as detected by histopathological analysis (data not shown). The 2 mg/kg/day dose was also effective at decreasing disease progression. However, some of the mice in this treatment group showed signs of toxicity in the loss of body weight while others in this group appeared to tolerate gemcitabine well. Like the animals treated with 1 mg/kg/day gemcitabine, there was no hepatotoxicity observed in animals treated with 2 mg/kg/day gemcitabine. The extent to which gemcitabine effected the animals in the 2 mg/kg group was not limited to toxicity as the efficacy of gemcitabine's antiviral activity also varied (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015840-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Although it is not clear why the mice could have such different responses to the drug, the affect of this variation could be minimized by increasing the number of animals in each treatment group.</p>
      <p>Although gemcitabine has been used as cancer chemotherapy for many years, it has likely been neglected as an antiviral due to its poor oral bioavailability, which would necessitate drug delivery by injection. However, a prodrug for gemcitabine has been described recently, making gemcitabine a more attractive candidate for use in treatment of retroviral infections, including highly drug-resistant HIV-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015840-Bender1">[24]</xref>. If its bioavailability is improved, gemcitabine could serve as a novel anti-HIV drug for those resistant to the current therapies.</p>
      <p>In summary, the findings of our study indicate that gemcitabine has potent antiretroviral activity in vivo and ex vivo using the LP-BM5 MuLV model. These findings, along with previous ex vivo HIV-1 studies with gemicitabine an decitabine, suggest that gemcitabine has broad antiretroviral activity and could be particularly useful in vivo when used in combination drug therapy.</p>
