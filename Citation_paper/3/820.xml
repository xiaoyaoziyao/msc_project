          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Our current understanding of the composition and stability of the human distal gut microbiota is based largely on studies of infants and adults living in developed countries. In contrast, little is known about the gut microbiota and its variation over time in older children and adolescents, especially in developing countries.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>We compared the diversity, composition, and temporal stability of the fecal microbiota of healthy children, ages 9 to 14 years, living in an urban slum in Bangladesh with that of children of the same age range in an upper-middle class suburban community in the United States. We analyzed &gt;8,000 near full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences and over 845,000 pyrosequencing reads of the 16S rRNA V1–V3 region. The distal gut of Bangladeshi children harbored significantly greater bacterial diversity than that of U.S. children, including novel lineages from several bacterial phyla. Bangladeshi and U.S. children had distinct fecal bacterial community membership and structure; the microbiota of Bangladeshi children was enriched in <italic>Prevotella</italic>, <italic>Butyrivibrio</italic>, and <italic>Oscillospira</italic> and depleted in <italic>Bacteroides</italic> relative to U.S. children (although similar to Bangladeshi adults). Furthermore, community membership and structure in Bangladeshi children was significantly less stable month-to-month than U.S. children.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
          <p>Together, these results suggest that differing environmental or genetic factors may shape the microbiota of healthy children in the two countries. Further investigation is necessary to understand the mechanisms and factors that underlie these differences, and to incorporate these findings into new strategies for the prevention and treatment of childhood and adolescent diseases.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Of the 1.2 billion global adolescent population, 88% live in developing nations where the incidence of environmental enteropathy – a multifaceted, subclinical intestinal disorder encompassing repeated episodes of infectious gastroenteritis, chronic inflammation, and malnutrition – ranges from 50–95% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-UNICEF1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Humphrey1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Campbell1">[3]</xref>. It is thought that the human indigenous gut microbiota may potentially serve a critical role in this disorder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Kau1">[4]</xref>. To date, the human gut microbiota has been characterized in depth using molecular approaches from individuals in only a few low-income areas of the developing world <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Monira1">[5]</xref>. Recent work highlights the importance of geography in explaining the gut microbiota composition of adults and children <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-DeFilippo1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Yatsunenko1">[7]</xref> and underscores the need to select additional geographic settings in an effort to characterize the global extent of human-associated microbial diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Chatterjee1">[8]</xref>. Furthermore, the influence of geography on the temporal stability of the composition of the gut microbiota within healthy individuals has not previously been examined, in part because of the difficulty in obtaining serial samples from a consistently healthy reference population in areas with high rates of environmental enteropathy or other gastrointestinal conditions.</p>
      <p>Long-term monitoring programs such as those at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) present a valuable opportunity to select samples in a retrospective manner from healthy at-risk children without recent disease (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://report.nih.gov/" xlink:type="simple">http://report.nih.gov/</ext-link>; NIH grant 5R01AI043596). The present study compares the taxonomic composition of the distal gut microbiota of relatively healthy children, ages eight to fourteen, living in an urban slum in Bangladesh with that of children of the same age range living in an upper-middle class suburban community in the United States. We used a cultivation-independent, molecular phylogenetic approach, relying on both near full-length and shorter hypervariable region 16S rRNA sequences, to compare the monthly intra-individual dynamics and interpersonal variation of fecal microbial communities in Bangladeshi and U.S. children.</p>

        <title>Sample collection</title>
        <p>Fecal specimens from 6 Bangladeshi children (ages 8–13), 4 Bangladeshi adults (ages 18–41), and 4 U.S. children (ages 10–14 years) were selected for study from a much larger population of subjects and associated specimens. The fecal sampling schedule consisted of 5 consecutive monthly samples from 4 of the Bangladeshi children, 6 consecutive monthly samples from the U.S. children, and 1 sample each from the Bangladeshi adults and the other 2 Bangladeshi children (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053838-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

Bangladeshi child 12 M was stunted with a height-for-age Z-score (HAZ) of −2.42. Due to the constraints of previously-designed studies, the BK and BA participants met different exclusion criteria than the UC and BC participants. BK and BA participants did not have diarrheal illness for 3 months or anti-parasitic medicine for 1 month before the first fecal sample. In contrast, the UC and BC participants reported no diarrheal illness, received no antimicrobial therapy, and had no identified enteric pathogens for 3 months prior to the first fecal sample.</p>

          <p>Since 1999, Haque <italic>et al</italic> have conducted a longitudinal study of susceptibility to amebiasis and enteric infections and have amassed a study cohort in Section 11 of the densely populated Mirpur urban slum of Dhaka, which has ∼50,000 residents. Most of the residents are of Bihari ethnic origin and remain mired in low socioeconomic conditions with an average monthly income per family of &lt;5,000 takas (U.S. $61). 75% of fathers and 85% of mothers have less than five years of education, and rice and bread are the main dietary staples of the daily diet. Unsafe water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene are the main conduits for disease transmission in Mirpur. Only 33% of the households have direct access to water from a municipal supply with the remaining households obtaining water through plastic pipes that illegally siphon municipal water but are often cracked and contaminated and located near latrines and drains. Residents use sanitary latrines or pit latrines that are discharged into sewage flowing openly through the slum.</p>
          <p>A retrospective analysis was conducted on fecal specimens from this existing cohort of ∼420 children ages 8–13. ICDDR,B health care workers visited and interviewed the children and their families at their homes on alternating days to monitor health and stool characteristics (frequency, presence of blood, accompaniment by fever). Patient medical history, socioeconomic characterization, house location, and nutritional status were recorded by the ICDDR,B field team. Episodes of diarrheal illnesses and associated diagnosis and treatments were also recorded for each child. A monthly surveillance non-diarrheal fecal specimen was collected from each child. Field staff instructed caregivers to ask the child to defecate on a plastic sheet and to collect material from the top of a fresh stool pile that had not contacted any other surface. All fecal specimens were stored in stool collection vials and transported on ice to ICDDR,B within 2–4 hours after collection. Fecal samples were stored at −80°C. Stools were screened for bacteria (including enterotoxigenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, enteropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic>, <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic>, <italic>Salmonella</italic> sp., <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic>, <italic>Plesiomonas shigelloides</italic>), viruses (rotavirus, astrovirus, adenovirus), and parasites (<italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic>, <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic>, <italic>Giardia lamblia</italic>, <italic>Trichuris trichiura</italic>, <italic>Ascaris lumbricoides</italic>, <italic>Strongyloides stercoralis</italic>, <italic>Hymenolepis nana</italic>, and hookworm) using standard culture methods, microscopy, and antigen detection tests (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Haque1">[9]</xref> for the complete list of tested agents and detailed methods).

To create a high-quality reference database with broad phylogenetic coverage of and shared similarity with our query sequences, we supplemented the Greengenes near full-length reference database (gg_99_otus_4feb2011_aligned.fasta; 84,566 unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs)) with the 503 near full-length OTU representative sequences from the 3 Bangladeshi children described below (see Methods section “<italic>Amplification, cloning, and sequencing of near full-length 16S rRNA genes</italic>”). To avoid redundancies in the final reference database, we clustered these 503 representative sequences and the Greengenes reference set with UCLUST at a similarity threshold of 97%. The 153 sequences that failed to cluster at this threshold setting were combined with the Greengenes reference sequences to form a combined Greengenes-Bangladesh reference database. This new Greengenes-Bangladesh reference database was aligned against the Greengenes core set alignment and a modified PH Lane mask was applied to trim the sequences to the V1–V3 region and then clustered at a 99% similarity threshold. The most abundant sequence within each OTU was selected as the OTU representative sequence. The resulting final Greengenes-Bangladesh reference database contained 63,774 representative OTUs.

        <title>Analysis of quality-filtered V1–V3 pyrosequencing reads</title>
        <p>For the pyrosequencing data set, an OTU was defined at 97% sequence similarity (in contrast to the 99% OTU definition for near full-length Sanger sequences) because thresholds more stringent than 97% for pyrosequencing reads tend to inflate diversity estimates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Kunin1">[15]</xref>. Pyrosequencing reads within the 97% similarity threshold were identified with UCLUST (800,465 query reads binned into 1,831 reference OTUs). 45,205 query reads that failed to cluster with reference sequences at this similarity threshold were binned into 2,609 new OTUs. The most abundant sequence within each new or reference OTU was chosen as the OTU representative sequence. Because novel sequences were discovered in the Bangladeshi near full-length dataset (as described below), one benefit of using this hybrid reference database and <italic>de novo</italic> clustering approach was that OTU clusters were first seeded with high-quality reference sequences; the <italic>de novo</italic> clustering allowed the binning of novel reads (instead of discarding them). The PyNAST alignment algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Caporaso2">[16]</xref> was used to align OTU representative sequences against the Greengenes core set alignment with a minimum alignment length of 150 and a minimum identity of 75% (35 OTU representative sequences failed to align). The OTU representative sequences were screened for chimeras with the Chimera Slayer algorithm and the BLAST fragments approach in QIIME, and the intersecting set of flagged sequences from both methods (1,848 representative sequences) were excluded from the alignment and downstream analysis. The PH Lane mask was applied to the alignment to retain the conserved regions of the 16S rRNA gene and omit the hypervariable regions for phylogenetic inference. Based on this alignment of OTU representative sequences, a phylogenetic tree was inferred using FastTree software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Price1">[17]</xref>.

        <p>Good's estimator of coverage, the proportion of non-singleton OTUs in the dataset as a measure of overall OTU sampling completion, was used to assess the adequacy of sampling. Microbial diversity was evaluated within samples (α diversity) or between samples (β diversity) using QIIME. Rarefaction, to a subsampling depth (determined by the minimum number of sequences in a sample from a single time point) of 6,596 reads/sample (unless otherwise noted) and 5 iterations, was performed on all samples to standardize the sequencing effort. Alpha diversity was measured with the Chao1 (richness), Phylogenetic Diversity (branch length-based diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Faith1">[20]</xref>), Shannon entropy (OTU-based diversity), and observed species metrics. Alpha diversity means and statistical significance tests were calculated in Excel and error bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM). Beta diversity was evaluated with UniFrac, a community dissimilarity metric based on the fraction of unique branch length observed in pairs of communities in a common phylogenetic tree <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Lozupone1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Hamady1">[22]</xref>. The phylogenetic distance (UniFrac distance) is calculated as the fraction of unshared branch lengths between the pair of communities. Unweighted and weighted UniFrac distance matrices served as inputs for clustering analyses and significance tests aimed at determining which variable explained the greatest amounts of variation in the taxonomic composition of the gut bacterial communities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Lozupone2">[23]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Unweighted UniFrac distances compare microbial communities within a phylogenetic context based on the presence/absence of members, while weighted UniFrac also incorporates relative abundance information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Lozupone2">[23]</xref>. UniFrac-based Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) aids in the exploration of potential factors (such as country or age) that might explain the groupings of similar communities. PCoA, visualized with KiNG software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu/software/king.php" xlink:type="simple">http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu/software/king.php</ext-link>), was used to map the UniFrac distance matrix onto a set of orthogonal axes capturing the greatest amount of variation in all the samples tested. Distances between samples on a PCoA plot reflect the corresponding dissimilarities in their community membership (unweighted UniFrac) or community structure (weighted UniFrac). Samples were hierarchically clustered based on their inter-sample UniFrac distances using Unweighted-Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean (UPGMA), and jackknifing support was provided at each internal node by re-sampling 100 times with replacement at a depth of 6,596 sequences per sample.</p>
        <p>Statistical significance of factors potentially contributing to compositional differences among microbiota samples was tested with PRIMER software using the non-parametric permutation analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) function, analogous to the univariate ANOVA (analysis of variance) test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Clark1">[24]</xref>. The ANOSIM global test statistic, R, generally returns a value between −1 and 1. R approximates 0 if no differences are observed according to sample class (e.g., country of origin), and R = 1 if all samples within a given class are more similar to each other than samples from a different class.

        <title>Microbiota from Bangladeshi children is more diverse than microbiota from U.S. children</title>
        <p>After rarefaction to 6,596 reads per sample, comparisons of the V1–V3 sequences using several alpha diversity metrics revealed significant differences between the two groups of subjects. Overall, the Bangladeshi children exhibited greater diversity, including greater evenness, than the U.S. children, as revealed by the individual rarefaction and rank abundance curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053838-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053838.s002">Figure S1B</xref>) and the Shannon Equitability Index (0.70 ± 0.01 for Bangladeshi children and 0.63 ± 0.01 for U.S. children; P&lt;0.0001, two-tailed t-test with unequal variance; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053838-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Bangladeshi children were characterized by significantly higher levels of phylogenetic diversity (21.2 ± 1.2 in Bangladeshi children versus 13.4 ± 0.6 in U.S. children; P&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053838.s003">Figure S2</xref>), higher Shannon entropy (5.9 ± 0.1 in Bangladeshi children versus 5.0 ± 0.1 in U.S. children; P&lt;0.0001), and a larger number of observed OTUs (≥ 97% similarity; 349 ± 17 in Bangladeshi children versus 249 ± 10 in U.S. children; P&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053838-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053838.s003">Figure S2</xref>). Together, these results suggest that factors associated with habitation within distinct geographical regions may strongly influence the diversity of the gut microbiota in childhood.</p>

(B) Alpha diversity statistics. Phylogenetic Diversity (PD) is the minimum total branch length of the phylogenetic tree that incorporates all OTUs in a sample. The number of observed species was calculated at a similarity threshold of 97%. Shannon Diversity index (H) characterizes species diversity and accounts for abundance and evenness of the species. Shannon equitability index (E<sub>H</sub>) is a measure of evenness. If S is the number of observed species, then E<sub>H</sub> = H/ln (S). Due to the unequal number of measurements in the time series for each child (5 for Bangladeshi children and 6 for U.S. children), all 5 monthly measurements from each of 4 Bangladeshi children and the first 5 monthly measurements from each of 4 U.S. children were averaged. Only samples from the children (BC and UC participants) were included in this alpha diversity analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053838-t001">Table 1</xref>).

        <title>Bangladeshi and U.S. distal gut microbiota are compositionally distinct</title>
        <p>In our study, phylogenetic composition-based sample clustering was associated with subject country of residence. In unweighted UniFrac PCoA, the first principal coordinate (PC1) captured 30% of intersample variance and revealed a sharp distinction between the gut microbiota of Bangladeshi and U.S. children (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053838-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). This difference was significant with a non-parametric permutation analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) test, analogous to the univariate ANOVA (analysis of variance) test, where R = 0.96 (p&lt;0.001). Parallel results were obtained with weighted UniFrac analysis, where PC1 (55%) and PC2 (14%) resolved differences between Bangladeshi and U.S. children (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053838.s004">Figure S3A</xref>), and with Bray-Curtis analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053838.s004">Figure S3B</xref>).

        <p>Looking beyond geography, PC2 (9.8% of variance) and PC3 (7.8% of variance) separated samples based on individual subject, and varying levels of intra-individual clustering of monthly time points occurred in all children (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053838-g002">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053838.s005">Figure S4</xref>). Similar unweighted UniFrac PCoA findings were attained at different OTU thresholds (90%, 95%, and 99%) (data not shown). All children were distinct from each other (ANOSIM pairwise comparisons generated an R&gt;0.5; p&lt;0.05) except Bangladeshi child 9F when compared to Bangladeshi child 12 M or Bangladeshi child 13 M (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053838.s001">Table S1B</xref>). The observation that the three Chinese-American children clustered separately from the only European-American child in the cohort may be due to dietary or genetic factors. Clustering associated with gender (R = 0.07; p&lt;0.05), age, seasonality, collection month, nutrition status, and mother's education level was not observed, although the number of individuals in this study was small and may have precluded the identification of significant differences based on these variables (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053838.s006">Figures S5A and S5B</xref>; additional data not shown). Averaged, unweighted UniFrac distances supported observations from previous studies indicating that inter-individual variation is greater than intra-individual variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053838-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Human1">[38]</xref>. Unweighted and weighted UniFrac analysis revealed a tight clustering pattern between pairs of biological or technical replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053838.s005">Figures S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053838.s006">S5C</xref>). The variation between replicate pairs (measured by unweighted UniFrac distances) was significantly less than intra- or inter-individual variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053838-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest the possibility that the gut microbiota of children in Bangladesh and the United States is distinct, and that children in these two locales show both compositional individuality and temporal stability in their distal gut microbiota. Further studies and additional subjects are necessary to confirm these results.</p>

        <title>Taxonomic differences between microbiota of U.S. and Bangladeshi children</title>
        <p>The vast majority (99.1%) of V1–V3 sequences were assigned to six dominant phyla previously found in the human distal gut: Firmicutes (50.6%), Bacteroidetes (30.0%), Proteobacteria (8.7%), Tenericutes (7.9%), Verrucomicrobia (1.1%), and Actinobacteria (0.9%). A PCoA phylum biplot indicated that Firmicutes were more prevalent in the Bangladeshi children than in the U.S. children and that the opposite was true for Bacteroidetes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053838.s007">Figure S6A</xref>). Firmicutes (46%) and Bacteroidetes (43%) evenly dominated the gut microbiota of the U.S. children with modest representation of Tenericutes (4%), Proteobacteria (4%) and Verrucomicrobia (2%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053838-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, Firmicutes outnumbered Bacteroidetes 60% to 20% in the Bangladeshi children with a similar relative abundance of Proteobacteria (5%) as in the U.S. children and a greater amount of Tenericutes (12%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053838-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Some of these features were also observed in the Bangladeshi adults, namely, a high relative abundance of Firmicutes (50%) and a low abundance of Bacteroidetes (6%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053838-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>

        <p>At the genus level, more pronounced differences were observed between the Bangladeshi and U.S. children. Within the phylum Bacteroidetes, the genus <italic>Prevotella</italic> was the most prevalent genus in Bangladeshi children and adults, while the <italic>Bacteroides</italic> genus was the most prevalent in U.S. children (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053838-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053838.s007">Figure S6B</xref>).

U.S. and Bangladeshi children were both colonized by <italic>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</italic>, a prominent butyrate-producer. <italic>Dialister invisus</italic>, a Gram-negative, obligate anaerobe was highly abundant in U.S. child 10 M (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053838.s007">Figure S6B</xref>). All of the Verrucomicrobia-associated reads found in the U.S. children were classified as <italic>Akkermansia muciniphila</italic> (2%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053838-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). U.S. children 10 M and 13 M were particularly enriched in this species. After <italic>Prevotella</italic> (14%), the most prominent taxa in the Bangladeshi children included the family Ruminococcaceae (11%), the order Clostridiales (10%), and the genera <italic>Butyrivibrio</italic> (8%) and <italic>Oscillospira</italic> (6%) of the Firmicutes phylum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053838-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Other relatively abundant taxa in Bangladeshi children included the putative order RF39 within Tenericutes (7%), the genus <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> within Actinobacteria, and the lineage YS2 related to Cyanobacteria (1%). As with the U.S. and Bangladeshi children, the Ruminococcaceae family (8%) and the putative order RF39 (7%) were prevalent in Bangladeshi adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053838-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Like Bangladeshi children, Bangladeshi adults also featured the putative order YS2 (1%), the order Clostridiales (4%), the genus <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> (2%), and the genus <italic>Butyrivibrio</italic> (4%).</p>
        <p>Eight taxa were shared between Bangladeshi and U.S. children, three taxa were found only in the U.S. children, and thirteen taxa were exclusive to Bangladeshi children (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053838-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

The three taxa that were found only in the U.S. children included Ruminococcaceae-associated <italic>Clostridium</italic>, Erysipelotrichaceae-associated <italic>Clostridium</italic>, and <italic>Holdemania</italic>. The taxa exclusive to the Bangladeshi children were affiliated with the phyla Bacteroidetes (<italic>Prevotella</italic>, unclassified Bacteroidales), Firmicutes (<italic>Sarcina</italic>, <italic>Mitsuokella</italic>, unclassified Clostridiales-FamilyXIII IncertaeSedis, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, <italic>Butyrivibrio</italic>), Tenericutes (<italic>Catenibacterium</italic>, <italic>p-75-a5</italic>, <italic>Bulleidia</italic>), Proteobacteria (<italic>Succinivibrio</italic>, <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>), and Cyanobacteria (unclassified YS2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053838-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

            <p>The G test of independence was used to determine whether genus presence or absence was associated with one group of children or the other. A list of the most significant genera was compiled based on FDR-corrected p-values.

The genera exclusively found in Bangladeshi or U.S. children are outlined in red and blue, respectively. The overlapping area between the two groups represents the genera that are shared by all individuals from both countries. The size of each enclosed area is directly proportional to the number of genera that are found in each group. The genera are colored-coded according to the list of phyla on the right.

        <p>At the level of OTU, re-sampling-based multiple hypothesis testing was used to identify OTUs that significantly differed in relative abundance between the Bangladeshi and U.S. children (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053838-t003">Table 3</xref>). The two OTUs with relative abundances that were significantly higher in U.S. children than in Bangladeshi children were <italic>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</italic> and <italic>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</italic>. The two OTUs that were significantly more abundant in the Bangladeshi children were classified within <italic>Butyrivibrio</italic> and Clostridiales (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053838-t003">Table 3</xref>). That these two OTUs could not be resolved to a finer level of taxonomy (unassigned by the Greengenes database) is indicative of the presence of novel or unclassified species in the Bangladeshi children. This point is further underscored by the observation that 27 of the 185 novel OTUs from the set of near full-length sequences, shared less than 95% sequence similarity with any publicly-available sequence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053838-t004">Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053838-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The availability of near full-length sequences enabled species-level classification of a small proportion of the <italic>Prevotella</italic> OTUs found in the Bangladeshi children (data not shown). Only 216 of the 947 near full-length <italic>Prevotella</italic> sequences were classifiable at the species level (at a 99% similarity threshold) to a publicly-available, named sequence. Of these 216 classified, near full-length <italic>Prevotella</italic> sequences, 90% matched <italic>Prevotella copri</italic> and 7% matched <italic>Prevotella stercorea</italic>, two types of Gram-negative, anaerobic rods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Hayashi1">[39]</xref>.

Overall, these results demonstrated that features shared with Bangladeshi adults – a preponderance of <italic>Prevotella</italic> and <italic>Butyrivibrio</italic>, and a lack of <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, among other taxa – contributed heavily to the compositional differences between Bangladeshi child distal gut microbiota and the microbiota of U.S. children.</p>

        <title>Gut microbiota composition is less stable over time in Bangladeshi versus U.S. children</title>
        <p>Overall, the U.S. children exhibited a higher degree of intra-individual similarity over time, as measured by unweighted UniFrac distance, compared to the Bangladeshi children (0.40 versus 0.53 respectively; p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053838-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Intrapersonal monthly variation correlated inversely with age in the Bangladeshi child cohort, although the small number of children in this study prevents a robust analysis of this issue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053838.s008">Figure S7A</xref>). This age-related correlation was not observed among the U.S. child cohort (p&gt;0.05). At the phylum level, a greater degree of variation in relative abundance was observed between the consecutive monthly samples from the Bangladeshi children compared to the U.S. children (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053838.s009">Figure S8</xref>). Comparing the average unweighted UniFrac distance for only consecutive time points (rather than all time points, as above) between the two groups underscores the greater intra-individual temporal variation in the Bangladeshi children relative to the U.S. children (0.52 versus 0.39 respectively; p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053838.s008">Figure S7B</xref>). Temporal autocorrelation was modeled to ensure that the time interval between samplings did not bias the unweighted UniFrac distances (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053838.s008">Figure S7C</xref>).</p>
        <p>Temporal variability was also observed at the genus level within both the U.S. and Bangladeshi children (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053838-g006">Figure 6</xref>), especially among the most abundant genera. Three of the four U.S. children (U.S. children 12F, 14F, and 13 M) experienced more than 10% change in the relative abundance of their <italic>Bacteroides</italic> population for three out of five monthly transitions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053838.s010">Figure S9A</xref>). The most dramatic shift in the <italic>Bacteroides</italic> population occurred between the second and third months for U.S. child 14F, when the population sharply increased from 24% to 69% (a change of 45%).

The average pairwise weighted UniFrac distance between near full-length and V1–V3 data from the same sample (0.16 ± 0.01) was less than the average distance between either V1–V3 or near full-length data from different samples of the same individual (0.37 ± 0.02 versus 0.38 ± 0.01 respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053838.s011">Figure S10C</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Overall, we found that Bangladeshi children harbor greater bacterial diversity and evenness in the distal gut than U.S. children. Our results are similar to previous observations of higher bacterial diversity in children living in rural Burkina Faso compared to children from urban Italy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-DeFilippo1">[6]</xref>. Our findings also align with those of a 2012 study revealing that Venezuelan Amazonas and rural Malawian adults had higher bacterial diversity compared to U.S. adults living in metropolitan areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Yatsunenko1">[7]</xref>. Notably, a 2011 study demonstrated that healthy Bangladeshi children (ages 2–3 years) had higher microbial diversity relative to malnourished children <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Monira1">[5]</xref>. As an aside, we found that inter-individual variation in the fecal microbiome of these subjects is greater than intra-individual variation, a finding that is supported by a Human Microbiome Project study involving the largest cohort to date (242 individuals) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Human1">[38]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In our study, the differences in the fecal microbiomes of these Bangladeshi and U.S. children reflect a number of potentially important, and interwoven contributing factors, such as socioeconomic status, genetics, dietary habits, sanitary, and other environmental conditions. In an effort to focus exclusively on variation in the distal gut microbiome during states of health, we carefully selected the four Bangladeshi children for our study (9F, 13F, 12 M, and 13 M) according to stringent and consistent criteria, including an absence of diarrhea or confirmed enteric infectious disease for 8 consecutive months in total. Of the existing ICDDR,B cohort of ∼420 children, only six children (including the four we studied) met these criteria. It is possible that our selection of children based on the absence of recent diarrhea and enteric infections is associated with the observed high diversity of their distal gut microbiota; diversity is thought to confer resilience by ensuring functional redundancy and ecosystem stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Yachi1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-McCann1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Kennedy1">[46]</xref>. This explanation is supported by a 2012 study in which a cohort of healthy Bangladeshi children exhibited higher bacterial diversity compared to their siblings recovering from acute diarrheal illness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Monira2">[47]</xref>. Further studies involving more subjects are necessary to understand how the gut microbial diversity of Bangladeshi children with recent intestinal illness would compare to that of healthy children in Bangladesh or the U.S.</p>
      <p>The patterns of diversity in this small subset of Bangladeshi children may be either the result or the cause of the recent absence of diarrheal illness (or be unrelated). With respect to the possibility of a contributing or causal role, the diverse microbiota of these Bangladeshi children may decrease susceptibility to pathogen invasion by preventing access of pathogens to the appropriate target cells or tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Bernet1">[48]</xref>, competing for nutrients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Hooper1">[49]</xref>, secreting antimicrobial peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Lievin1">[50]</xref>, and/or modulating the immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Borruel1">[51]</xref>. Compared to conventional mice, strains of mice with low gut microbiota diversity are more susceptible to <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> colonization and enterocolitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Stecher1">[52]</xref>. Reduced gut microbiota diversity has been implicated in several morbidities such as inflammatory bowel diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Murphy1">[53]</xref> and diarrhea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Mai1">[54]</xref>. In our study, <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> was enriched and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> was exclusively found in Bangladeshi children. Numerous studies have investigated the properties of specific strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria that prevent pathogen invasion through competitive exclusion, production of antimicrobials, and other mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Servin1">[55]</xref>. Stecher <italic>et al.</italic> hypothesize that closely-related species may increase the likelihood of gut colonization by newly-incoming species due to favorable conditions that maximize growth for both the resident and incoming species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Stecher1">[52]</xref>. This concept could potentially enable a more targeted use of probiotics to prevent gastrointestinal infections in Bangladeshi children who live in slum settings.</p>
      <p>Dietary factors may be particularly important in explaining the observed differences in the composition of the distal gut microbiota between the Bangladeshi and U.S. children. The diet of the Bangladeshi children was carbohydrate-rich and heavily dependent on rice, bread, and lentils with rarely any meat. Their U.S. counterparts consumed typical Western diets including animal fat and protein in addition to carbohydrates and vegetables. In a 2009 study of U.S. adult twins (ages 21–32 years) consuming typical Western diets, obese individuals exhibited a higher Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio than lean individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Turnbaugh1">[56]</xref>. Therefore, based on weight assumptions (weight data were not collected in our U.S. cohort), one would predict that the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio in the U.S. children would be higher than the ratio in the Bangladeshi children. However, in our study, the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio was 1∶1 in the U.S. children, and the ratio was 3∶1 in the Bangladeshi children. Perhaps this departure from expected results is attributable to age or geographical differences. Another possibility is that our results support the idea that the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio varies widely across healthy individuals, as was observed in the recent study of the gut microbiota from 242 U.S. adults (ages 18–40 years) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Human1">[38]</xref>. A larger survey of Bangladeshi and U.S. children is necessary to understand the proportions of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in relation to their metabolic pathways. Within the Bacteroidetes phylum, <italic>Prevotella</italic> dominated the gut microbiota of the Bangladeshi children while <italic>Bacteroides</italic> dominated the U.S. microbiota. These results show striking similarities to the findings of a 2010 study comparing the fecal microbiota of children from Burkina Faso who consume diets high in carbohydrates and low in protein with that of children from Italy who consume typical Western diets rich in meat, dairy, and carbohydrates. <italic>Prevotella</italic> were highly abundant in the microbiota of the children living in Burkina Faso, in contrast to the children in Italy whose microbiota was dominated by <italic>Bacteroides</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-DeFilippo1">[6]</xref>. A <italic>Bacteroides</italic>-dominated gut community is significantly associated with long-term diets rich in animal protein and saturated fat, while a <italic>Prevotella</italic>-dominated community is associated with a plant-based diet high in carbohydrates and lacking in meat and dairy products <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Wu1">[57]</xref>. <italic>Parabacteroides</italic> (present in U.S. children 12F, 14F, and 13 M), <italic>Alistipes</italic> (present in all four U.S. children), and other taxa that co-occur with a <italic>Bacteroides</italic>–dominated signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053838-g006">Figure 6</xref>) are particularly adept at fermenting carbohydrates and protein to extract energy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Wu1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Arumugam1">[58]</xref>. Conversely, <italic>Catenibacterium</italic> (present in all 4 Bangladeshi children) and other bacteria that co-occur with a <italic>Prevotella</italic>-dominated gut community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053838-g006">Figure 6</xref>) degrade mucin and simple sugars <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Wu1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Arumugam1">[58]</xref>. Although our study examined only a small number of subjects, our results support an association between diet and gut microbiota. Our findings also underscore the importance of characterizing gut microbiota composition in subjects residing in varied geographical contexts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-DeFilippo1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Yatsunenko1">[7]</xref>. For example, features of diet are shared between residents of Burkina Faso and Bangladesh, whereas other factors (confounded with diet in comparisons to Western populations) such as host genetics, rural versus urban, are not.</p>
      <p>To our knowledge, this study is the first to compare the temporal stability of distal gut microbiota of primary school-age children and adolescents in developing and developed countries. To date, most previous studies have focused on the temporal variation of the microbiota of infants and adults from developed countries. In these previous studies, dramatic perturbations in the gut microbiota observed over multiple time points have corresponded with significant changes in diet or antibiotic usage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Dethlefsen1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Dethlefsen2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053838-Koenig1">[59]</xref>. In our study, consecutive monthly samples from the Bangladeshi children exhibited a greater degree of variation in the relative abundance of phyla compared to the monthly samples from the U.S. children. Since the Bangladeshi and U.S. children were closely monitored and did not receive antimicrobial therapy for 8 or 9 consecutive months, the higher temporal variation observed in the Bangladeshi children is likely not attributed to antibiotic usage. Although diet was not controlled for in either group, in general, Bangladeshi children from low-income families have access to a smaller variety of foods compared to U.S. children from affluent families. Hence, variability in the diet probably does not contribute to the larger degree of temporal variation observed in the gut microbiota of Bangladeshi children. One potential, alternative explanation is that a high level of temporal variation may result from more frequent or intensive exposure to bacteria in the environment due to unhygienic conditions, resulting in subclinical perturbations to their gut microbiota. Additional data are needed to test this hypothesis.</p>
      <p>Although our key observations align with those of recent studies, due to the small sample size and overall design of this study, we view these results as supportive but not definitive evidence for our conclusions. Recruiting subjects and collecting multiple samples from each individual in the setting of this study is a difficult process, but subsequent studies should control for socioeconomic, genetic, and dietary variables. To begin to understand the role of the gut microbiota in relation to these and other factors, adequately-powered studies directly comparing the gut microbiota of different groups of subjects differing by only one or two of these variables are warranted. Moreover, a large-scale, randomized controlled trial involving targeted interventions would provide a better platform for unraveling these interactions. Extending these experiments to relevant animal models would help in examining possible causal relationships.</p>
      <p>In summary, this study expands our knowledge about the distal gut microbiota of primary school-age children and adolescents in developing and developed countries. Healthy Bangladeshi children exhibit stark differences in community structure, greater gut microbial diversity, and higher monthly baseline variation compared to U.S. children, factors that may demand consideration in studies that seek to understand microbiome associations with childhood disease in developing countries. While it is not possible to pinpoint causal relationships underlying the compositional differences between the microbiota of these Bangladeshi and U.S. children, dietary, genetic, and environmental factors are all likely to play a role. These results may help direct the design of future studies and contribute to a much-needed foundation for the future implementation of strategies for manipulating the microbiota of children to enhance and restore health.</p>

P-values were calculated by a two-tailed t-test with unequal variance, and all p-value pairwise comparisons are displayed in the corresponding table. (B) The consecutive monthly intraindividual variation is compared between U.S. and Bangladeshi children. The average distance between month 1 and month 2, month 2 and month 3, and so on, of one subject is compared to the distance between the same consecutive months in another subject. The mean unweighted UniFrac distance is shown ± SEM, and p-values were calculated by a two-tailed t-test with unequal variance. Bangladeshi and U.S. children are in red and blue respectively, and only Bangladeshi children and U.S. children were included in charts A and B. (C) Temporal autocorrelation was modeled and demonstrates that the time interval between samplings did not bias the unweighted UniFrac distances. The slope of the line approaches 0 and the trendline does not fit the data points well (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.001); therefore, there is virtually no correlation between the number of days between sampling and unweighted UniFrac distances.</p>

The blue line represents the observed species richness. The red line represents the range of estimated OTU richness as predicted by the Chao1 non-parametric estimator and indicates that the total OTU richness is much higher than observed with our available near full-length 16S rDNA clone library sampling. The error bars on the Chao1 estimator correspond to the lower and upper bound 95% confidence intervals.
