<p>Spinach (<italic>Spinacia oleracea</italic> L., 2n = 2x = 12) is an economically important vegetable crop worldwide and one of the healthiest vegetables due to its high concentrations of nutrients and minerals. The objective of this research was to conduct genetic diversity and population structure analysis of a collection of world-wide spinach genotypes using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) markers. Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) was used to discover SNPs in spinach genotypes. Three sets of spinach genotypes were used: 1) 268 USDA GRIN spinach germplasm accessions originally collected from 30 countries; 2) 45 commercial spinach F1 hybrids from three countries; and 3) 30 US Arkansas spinach cultivars/breeding lines. The results from this study indicated that there was genetic diversity among the 343 spinach genotypes tested. Furthermore, the genetic background in improved commercial F1 hybrids and in Arkansas cultivars/lines had a different structured populations from the USDA germplasm. In addition, the genetic diversity and population structures were associated with geographic origin and germplasm from the US Arkansas breeding program had a unique genetic background. These data could provide genetic diversity information and the molecular markers for selecting parents in spinach breeding programs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Spinach (<italic>Spinacia oleracea</italic> L.) has become an increasingly important economic vegetable crop worldwide with an estimated annual value of $11.8 billion (Correll et al. 2011; van Deynze 2014) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref002">2</xref>]. The US is the second largest producer of spinach after China with over 550,000 tons of spinach harvested, valued at over $300 million annually (Correll et al. 2011; NASS 2015) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref003">3</xref>]. In addition to its economic importance, spinach is one of the healthiest vegetables in the human diet due to its high concentration of nutrients and health-promoting compounds (Dicoteau 2000; Morelock 2005) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref005">5</xref>]. During the last 15 years, the US spinach industry has seen a dramatic increase in fresh market demand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref003">3</xref>] (NASS 2015). This requires the development of improved cultivars to increase spinach production.</p>
<p>The success of a plant breeding program is largely dependent on the availability of genetically diverse plant germplasm to allow for cultivar improvement. The genetic diversity and population structure of a plant species allows geneticists and plant breeders to use the resources for crop improvement. Such an approach has benefited many crops, for example cucumber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref006">6</xref>] (Ly et al. 2012), maize (Zhang et al. 2016) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref007">7</xref>], rice (Kuwahara et al. 2014) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref008">8</xref>], and soybean (Li et al. 2008) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref009">9</xref>]. Genetic diversity and population structure also have been examined in spinach (Khattak et al. 2007) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref010">10</xref>] examined the genetic diversity of 33 spinach hybrid cultivars, from seven different breeding stations all over the world, using 13 SSR markers and the results showed that the spinach hybrids were grouped into three clusters; the first two of the three clusters consisted of European spinach types, which were well discriminated according to their origin from different breeding stations; the third cluster was a mixture of Asian as well as European types of spinach; and the subclusters in the third group did not reflect differences in morphology, earliness or company origin. Hu et al. (2007) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref011">11</xref>] analyzed the genetic diversity among 38 USDA spinach germplasm accessions and 10 commercial hybrids of spinach using target region amplification polymorphism (TRAP) markers and found the average pair-wise genetic similarity coefficient (Dice) was 57.5% with a range from 23.2 to 85.3% and indicated that the genetic relationships among the accessions examined were not highly associated with the geographic locations in which the germplasm was collected. Eftekhari et al. (2010) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref012">12</xref>] examined genetic diversity among 44 Iranian spinach landraces using 21 morphological characteristics under open field conditions and the materials were clustered into four groups containing 14, 4, 19 and 7 landraces, respectively: the first group included landraces with a similarity in leaf shape and female plant percent; in the second group, included materials with a similar leaf number and shape, pedicle length, growing period and fresh weight; the third group included landraces with spiny seed similar plant fresh weight and growing period; and the forth group included lines with a similar plant dry weight. Kuwahara et al. (2014) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref008">8</xref>] assessed the genetic diversity among 50 spinach germplasm accessions collected from geographically diverse regions of West Asia, East Asia, Japan, Europe and the USA using SSR markers and found the genetic diversity was affected by geographical regions. Wu et al. (2013) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref013">13</xref>] determined the genetic diversity among 110 spinach germplasms accessions collected from different geographical origins and identified two major groups, where group 1 was comprised of spinach which originated in European, America, West Asia, East Asia, and Northern China, whereas group 2 consisted of spinach originated in Southern China and Japan. The results suggested that Northern and Southern Chinese spinach populations may have different origins. Sabaghnia et al. (2014) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref014">14</xref>] examined 54 spinach landraces collected from diverse geographical regions of Iran and divided the landraces into sixteen clusters based on for several qualitative and quantitative trait data. Ebadi-Segheloo et al. (2014) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref015">15</xref>] evaluated 121 spinach landraces, collected from the various spinach growing areas of Iran, using several agro-morphological traits such as leaf area, leaf width, petiole length, petiole diameter, seed yield and 1000-seed weight and identified six clusters with each cluster having some specific unique characteristics. Recently, Xu et al (2017) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref016">16</xref>] analyzed the genetic diversity among 120 cultivated and wild spinach accessions including 107 cultivated <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oleracea</italic> and 13 wild accessions (5 <italic>S</italic>. <italic>tetrandra</italic> and 8 <italic>S</italic>. <italic>turkestanica</italic>) based on the transcriptome sequencing data and found that the 120 spinach accessions were clustered into three major groups: the first group consisted of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>turkestanica</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>tetrandra</italic> accessions; the second group contained cultivars from East Asia, Chinese commercial varieties and two cultivars from Pakistan and Russia; and the third group included cultivars from Central/West Asia, Europe, North America and Africa, as well as the remaining commercial cultivars.</p>
<p>With improved next generation sequencing (NGS), and the decreasing cost of sequencing, it is now feasible to discover millions of single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNPs) for any plant and connect these markers to desirable phenotypic traits. Spinach is a very popular vegetable crop which can greatly benefit from the development of molecular tools to improve commercial cultivars. Until recently, most of the breeding efforts to develop spinach cultivars against biotic and abiotic stresses have relied on conventional breeding approaches. Although this approach has yielded cultivars with improved characteristics, conventional breeding can be time-consuming, labor intensive, and expensive. Alternatively, spinach breeding can be accelerated by the utilization of molecular tools that can reduce the time and cost of screening plants for desired characteristics. Molecular plant breeding has been the foundation for 21st century crop improvement (reviewed by Moose and Mumm, 2008) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref017">17</xref>]. Marker assisted selection (MAS) has been used successfully in selection of specific genes/alleles in crop improvement (Collard et al. 2005; Collard and Mackill 2008; Xu and Crouch 2008) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref020">20</xref>]. DNA sequencing by NGS technologies (van Dijk et al. 2014) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref021">21</xref>] using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) (Elshire et al. 2011) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref022">22</xref>] can be applied to a wide array of organisms, including plants, for genome sequencing and SNP discovery. GBS is one of the genotyping approach using next-generation sequencing platforms that utilizes a simple highly-multiplexed system for constructing reduced representation libraries which reduces sample handling, requires fewer PCR and purification steps, no size fractionation and uses inexpensive barcoding (Elshire et al. 2011) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref022">22</xref>]. GBS is also a rapid and less expensive approach for trait mapping and association, and can be used in molecular breeding and allow plant breeders to conduct genomic selection on any germplasm or species with and without prior knowledge of the genome (Elshire et al., 2011; Sonah et al., 2013) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref023">23</xref>] and GBS have been widely used for SNP discovery in trait mapping and is an inexpensive and fast approach (Elmer et al. 2015; Nimmakayala et al. 2014) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref025">25</xref>]. Thus, using a GBS platform can be powerful approach for genome-wide SNP discovery, genetic diversity analysis, genetic map construction, linkage mapping, genome-wide association, and MAS in spinach. We used GBS for SNP discovery in spinach in this study. The spinach genome Spinach-1.0.3 is available to the public at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/?val=AYZV02" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/?val=AYZV02</ext-link> and also at “The Beta vulgaris Resource” web site with the page at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bvseq.molgen.mpg.de/Genome/Download/Spinach/" xlink:type="simple">http://bvseq.molgen.mpg.de/Genome/Download/Spinach/</ext-link>, representing approximately half of the spinach genome (Dohm et al. 2014; Minoche et al. 2015) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref027">27</xref>].</p>
<p>We used the AYZV02 as the reference of spinach genome sequences for short reads alignment and SNP discovery in each spinach sample in this study. The objective of this research was to conduct genetic diversity and population structure analyses in a collection of world-wide spinach genotypes using SNP markers.</p>

<title>DNA extraction, GBS, and SNP discovery</title>
<p>Genomic DNA was extracted from leaves of spinach plants using the CTAB (hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref028">28</xref>] (Hulbert and Bennetzen 1991). A DNA library was prepared using the restriction enzyme ApeKI following the GBS protocol described by Elshire et al. (2011) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref022">22</xref>] and DNA sequencing was performed using GBS method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref023">23</xref>] (Elshire et al. 2011; Sonah et al. 2013). The 90 bp, double-end sequencing was performed on each spinach genotype (accession/F1 hybrid/cultivar/line) using the GBS protocol by an Illumina HiSeq 2000 machine at the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) in Hong Kong. GBS data alignment, mapping and SNP discovery were done using SOAP family software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://soap.genomics.org.cn/" xlink:type="simple">http://soap.genomics.org.cn/</ext-link>) by the bioinformatics team at BGI. The GBS data provided by BGI averaged 3.26 M with 90 bp, short-read nucleotides for each spinach sample. The short reads of the GBS data were first aligned to the Spinach-1.0.3 spinach genome reference (AYZV02, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/?val=AYZV02" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/?val=AYZV02</ext-link>). The SOAP2 / SOAPsnp were used for SNP calling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref030">30</xref>] (Li, 2009; Luo et al., 2012). Approximately a half-million SNPs were discovered from the GBS data among the 343 spinach genotypes (germplasm accessions/F1 hybrids/lines), as provided by BGI. The spinach genotypes and SNPs were filtered before conducting genetic diversity analyses. If a spinach genotype had &gt;20% missing SNP data and the heterozygous SNP genotype was &gt;30%, the spinach genotype was removed from the panel. The SNP data were filtered to keep for minor allele frequency (MLF) &gt;2%, missing data &lt;7%, and heterozygous genotype &lt;25%.</p>

<title>Population structure and genetic diversity</title>
<p>The model-based program STUCTURE 2.3.4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref031">31</xref>] (Pritchard et al., 2000) was used to assess the population structure of each spinach set based on SNP loci postulated from GBS. In order to identify the number of populations (K) making up the structure of the data, the burn-in period was set at 10,000 with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo iterations and the run length set at 20,000 in an admixture model. The analysis then correlated allele frequencies independently for each run [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref006">6</xref>] (Lv et al., 2012). Ten runs were performed for each simulated value of K, which ranged from 1 to 10. For each simulated K, the statistical value delta K was calculated using the formula described by Evanno et al. (2005) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref032">32</xref>]. The optimal K was determined using Structure Harvester [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref033">33</xref>] (Earl and von Holdt, 2012; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://taylor0.biology.ucla.edu/structureHarvester/" xlink:type="simple">http://taylor0.biology.ucla.edu/structureHarvester/</ext-link>). Each spinach genotype was then assigned to a cluster (Q) based on the probability determined by the software that the genotype belonged in the cluster. The cut-off probability for assignment to a cluster was 0.525 for only two clusters (structure populations), or 0.50 for three or more clusters. Based on the optimum K, a Bar plot with ‘Sort by Q’ was obtained to show the population structure among the spinach genotypes (accessions/hybrids/lines).</p>
<p>Genetic diversity also was assessed, and the phylogeny trees were drawn using MEGA 6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref034">34</xref>] (Tamura et al., 2013) based on the Maximum Likelihood tree method with the following parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref035">35</xref>] (Shi et al. 2016) 2013). Test of Phylogeny: None, Model/Method: General Time Reversible model, Rates among Sites: Gamma distributed with Invariant sites (G + I), Number of Discrete Gamma Categories: 5, Gaps/Missing Data Treatment: Use all sites, ML Heuristic Method: Subtree-Pruning-Regrafting-Extensive (SPR level 5), Initial Tree for ML: Make initial tree automatically (Neighbor Joining), and Branch Swap Filter: Moderate. During the drawing of the phylogeny trees, the population structure and the cluster information were imported to MEGA 6 for combined analysis of genetic diversity. For sub-tree of each Q (cluster), the shape of ‘Node/Subtree Marker’ and the ‘Branch Line’ was drawn with the same color as in the figure of the Bar plot of the population clusters from the STRUCTURE analysis.</p>

The peak delta K was observed at K = 2, indicating the presence of two main population clusters, Q1 and Q2 in the spinach germplasm panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>).

<p>The genetic diversity among germplasm accessions was also assessed using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method in MEGA 6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref034">34</xref>] (Tamura et al., 2013), with phylogenetic trees drawn based on the results. Q1 and Q2 were defined as the two main clusters or populations (see above), with the same colors as the population structure Q1 (red) and Q2 (green) from the STRUCTURE 2.3.4 analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) to draw subtrees of the phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Q1 is denoted with a red color and round shape, and Q2 with a green color and square shape. Two phylogenetic trees were included: (1) without taxon names assigned in order to compare the populations from STRUCTURE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), and (2) the traditional rectangular phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s005">S1 Fig</xref>). The phylogenetic trees from MEGA 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s005">S1 Fig</xref>), were well consistent with the structure populations Q1 and Q2 developing in STRUCTURE 2.3.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>), indicating there were two differentiated genetic populations in the spinach germplasm panel, which was divided distinctly into two clusters.</p>
<p>Besides the two structured populations inferred using the STRUCTURE analysis, the second highest peak of delta K was observed at K = 5 using Structure Harvester, indicating the 268 spinach germplasm accessions may be divided into five clusters (Q1 to Q5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g002">Fig 2B</xref> shows the bar plot drawn in STRUCTURE to visualize the five clustered populations, where Q1 is red; Q2 is green; Q3 is blue; Q4 is yellow; and Q5 is purple. The classification of the germplasm accessions into populations based on the model-based structure developed in STRUCTURE 2.3.4 was shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g002">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s002">S2 Table</xref>. Each spinach accession also was assigned to one of the five populations based on probabilities calculated in STRUCTURE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s002">S2 Table</xref>). A Q value = 0.5 was used to divide the five populations (clusters) and the admixture. In total, 262 out of 268 accessions (97.8%) were assigned to one of the five populations, Q1 to Q5. Q1 to Q5 were consisted of 16 (6.0%), 35 (13.1%), 38 (14.2%), 64 (23.9%), and 109 (40.7%) accessions, respectively. The remaining 6 accessions (2.2%) were categorized as having admixed ancestry between Q1 to Q5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s002">S2 Table</xref>). Based on the five structured populations or clusters Q1 to Q5 among the 268 spinach germplasm accessions, Q1 mainly consisted of Asia accessions with 14 out of 16 accessions having 87.5% of total Q1 accessions; Q2 mainly Europe but not Turkey accessions with 65.7%; Q3 America accessions with 73.7%; Q4 Turkey accessions with 48.4%; and Q5 also Turkey accessions with 45.5%.

<title>Genetic diversity by region (group)</title>
<p>Based on geography in spinach panel, seven regions were generated in this study: ‘America’, ‘Asia’, ‘Europe’, ‘Turkey’, ‘Netherlands Commercial’, ‘America Commercial’ and ‘US Arkansas’. ‘America’ is the group of spinach accessions which were originally collected from United States of America (USA); ‘Asia’ is the group of the spinach accessions which were originally collected from Asia; ‘Europe’ is the group of the spinach accessions which were originally collected from Europe except Turkey; ‘Turkey’ is the group of the spinach accessions which were originally collected from Turkey (*because there were 81 spinach accessions from Turkey consisted of 30.2% of all 268 accessions, we listed Turkey as one group out of the Europe group.); ‘Netherlands Commercial’ is the group of the spinach commercial F1 hybrids which were originally collected from Netherlands; ‘‘America Commercial’ is the group of the spinach commercial F1 hybrids which were originally collected from Unites States of America; and ‘US Arkansas” is the group of the spinach lines which were originally collected from US Arkansas. In this study, we have only two sources of commercial F1 hybrids: one from Netherlands and another from USA.</p>
<p>The genetic diversity among the seven regions were analyzed and phylogenetic tree was drawn using MEGA 6: first computed between group mean distances and a two dimensions of genetic distances among the seven regions was created; and then the phylogenetic tree was drawn using neighbor-joining method. The results showed that (1) two clusters were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g005">Fig 5</xref>): Cluster R-I consisted of all spinach germplasm accessions from Asia, Turkey, Europe, and America. Cluster R-II included all commercial hybrids (Netherlands Commercial and America Commercial) and the Arkansas lines; (2) the spinach accessions from Turkey are closest to those from Asia, then closer to those from Europe, and then to America; and (3) both commercial F1 hybrids were closer to each other, indicating that the commercial F1 hybrids had closer genetic background than those germplasm. But they were merged together with US Arkansas spinach lines, validating that the Arkansas spinach lines have provided genetic resource used in both American and Netherland F1 hybrids as parents.</p>

<title>Genetic diversity by country</title>
<p>There are 11 countries with 6 or more spinach accessions in this study: Afghanistan has 15 accessions, Belgium 9, China 20, Hungary 6, India 6, Iran 15, Japan 6, Macedonia 16, Netherlands 36 (4 germplasm accessions and 32 hybrids), Turkey 81, and United States 81 (46 US germplasm accessions, 5 F1 and 30 breeding lines developed by University of Arkansas) (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188745.t001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188745.t002">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188745.t003">3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s004">S4</xref> Tables). The genetic diversity was analyzed for those spinach genotypes from the 11 countries in this study. In order to distinguish the sources of germplasm, commercial hybrids and Arkansas lines, the spinach genotypes from Netherlands were divided into two groups: Netherlands germplasm (‘Netherlands’) and Netherlands F1, and the spinach from America divided into three groups: America germplasm (‘United.States’), America F1 hybrids (‘US F1’), and Arkansas lines (‘US.AR’). In that way, a total of 14 ‘country groups’ were formed for genetic diversity study. Phylogenetic analysis showed that two larger clusters were produced: Cluster I included the spinach accessions from Arkansas lines (US.AR), commercial F1 hybrids from United States (US F1) and from Netherland (Netherlands F1), Unites States, Netherlands, Macedonia, and Hungary, and Cluster II consisted of the spinach germplasm accessions from Belgium Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan, India, Japan, and China. The cluster I can be further divided into two cluster I-1 and I-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Cluster I-1 included the accessions from US.AR, US F1, Netherland F1, and Unites States. Cluster I-2 had the accessions from Netherlands, Macedonia, and Hungary. The results furtherly indicated that spinach germplasm accessions had geographic effect that all accessions from Asia (Iran, Afghanistan, India, China, and Japan) were merged into cluster II and the accessions from the three European countries (Netherland, Macedonia, and Hungary) merged into cluster I-2. Both commercial F1 hybrids from United States (US F1) and from Netherlands (Netherlands F1) merged together, indicating that the commercial hybrids had closer genetic background than those germplasm. Both commercial F1 hybrids either from United States (US F1) or from Netherlands (Netherlands F1) merged together with Arkansas spinach lines (US.AR), indicating that the spinach germplasm from the University of Arkansas has been used in spinach commercial as parents and the commercial F1 hybrids have inheritable some genetic backgrounds from the Arkansas germplasm.</p>

<title>Genetic diversity in United States</title>
<p>A total of 91 spinach genotypes collected from United States were used for genetic diversity analysis in this study. Eighty-one of the 91 spinach genotypes had clear originally from US, which includes 46 US germplasm accessions, 5 US hybrids, and 30 breeding lines developed by University of Arkansas (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188745.t001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188745.t002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188745.t003">3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s004">S4</xref> Tables). In additions, three F1 hybrids, Alrite F1, Megaton F1, and Summer Focus F1 were from American Takii Company and the original seeds may be developed from America but they may be also developed in Japan. Four hybrids, Denali F1, Hector.F1, Indian Summer F1, and Spinner F1 were from Johnny Selected Seeds and the original seeds may be developed from America. The seven hybrids from American Takii and Johnny Selected Seeds were included in phylogenetic analysis. Besides the 04-103VGRS from AR lines, three its sister lines, 04-103FAY, 04-103FAY_09, and 04-103VGRS_09 were also included in the phylogenetic analysis with a total of 91 spinach genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s009">S5 Fig</xref>). From the phylogenetic tree, all 33 AR lines including the three 04-103VGRS sister-line were merged together as one group. Among which the 04-103VGRS and its three its sister lines were close together (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s009">S5 Fig</xref>); the 12 F1 hybrids were distributed in the two locations of the phylogenetic tree, among which Denali F1, Regal F1, Samish F1, Coho F1, and both Nordic IV F1 were closed together and near AR lines; and Indian Summer F1, Spinner F1, Tyee F1, Olympia F1, and Hector F1 closed together in another group; and most of PIs from US Maryland merged together. These results indicating that (1) Arkansas spinach had specific genetic backgrounds which separated from others; (2) hybrids were different from the germplasm as they merged together with two locations; and (3) there was a partially geographic effect because many spinach accessions were clustered by their origin of States.</p>

<title>Genetic diversity in Arkansas lines</title>
<p>The major contributions of the spinach breeding program at the University of Arkansas have been in the areas of disease resistant cultivars, particularly to white rust, such as ‘Fallgreen’, released in 1987, ‘F380’ released in 1998, and ‘Wintergreen’ released in 2003. These are some of the most highly resistant genotypes to white rust, and have been used widely as germplasm for white rust resistance and as parents by seed companies to develop resistant hybrids. Though the AR spinach germplasm had a relatively narrow genetic background compared to the world-wide spinach germplasm variation, the 30 AR spinach lines can be divided into four groups: AR-I, consisted of 18 lines including 08–116, 08–122, and 97–154; AR-II, comprised four lines, 04-103VGRS, 08-88-212, 08–104, and 08–140; AR-III, having only two lines, 08-03-318 and 08–101; and AR-IV, containing 6 lines including 08–144, 08–150, 08F380, 08–167, and 08–191 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s010">S6 Fig</xref>), indicating that some variation among the Arkansas lines.</p>

<title>Genetic diversity in world-wide spinach genotypes</title>
<p>As described above, a total of 343 spinach genotypes were used in this study, which included three types of spinach resources: 268 USDA GRIN spinach germplasm accessions, 45 spinach F1 hybrids, and 30 US Arkansas spinach lines (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188745.t001">Table 1</xref>). The genetic diversity and population structure have been analyzed for the 268 USDA accessions, the 45 hybrids, and the 30 Arkansas lines, respectively. Based on the three resources, a combined analysis of genetic diversity and population structure were conducted for the 343 spinach genotypes in this study as well.</p>
<p>As we did for the 268 USDA accessions, the population structure of the 343 spinach genotypes was initially inferred using STRUCTURE 2.3.4 (Pritchard et al., 2000). The peak delta K was observed at K = 2, indicating the presence of two main population clusters, Q1, and Q2 in the spinach panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>). The classification of accessions into populations or clusters according to the model-based structure from STRUCTURE 2.3.4 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g007">Fig 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s001">S1 Table</xref>. A Q-value = 0.50 was used to divide the clusters. In total, 335 of 343 germplasm accessions (97.7%) were assigned to one of the two populations or clusters. Q1 and Q2 consisted of 278 (81.0%) and 57 (16.6%) spinach genotypes, respectively, and the remaining 8 accessions (2.3%) were categorized as having admixed ancestry between Q1Q2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188745.t003">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s001">S1 Table</xref>). In the Q2 structured population, 50 out of 57 (87.7%) spinach genotypes were the Arkansas lines (30) and F1 commercial hybrids (20) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188745.t003">Table 3</xref>), and the two populations distinguished the USDA germplasm accessions from the commercial F1 hybrids and Arkansas lines, indicating that the commercial F1 hybrids and Arkansas lines have improved with their genetic backgrounds. Analyses based on each region-typed showed that the germplasm accessions except America mainly went to Q1; America had 13% in Q2 and 4.4% in the mixture Q1Q2; Arkansas went to Q2 with 100%; and hybrids went to both Q1, Q2, and mixture with 42.2%, 44.4%, and 13.3%, respectively, furtherly indicating that Arkansas lines had different genetic background from germplasm accessions; hybrids had both genetic backgrounds; and the majority of American germplasm accessions had more similar genetic background to other germplasm but were closer to the hybrid than others.</p>

<p>The genetic diversity among 343 genotypes was also assessed using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method in MEGA 6 (Tamura et al., 2013), with phylogenetic trees drawn based on the results. Q1 and Q2 were defined as the two main clusters or populations (see above), with the same colors as the population structure Q1 (red) and Q2 (green) from the STRUCTURE 2.3.4 analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g007">Fig 7B</xref>) to draw subtrees of the phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). Q1 is denoted with a red color and round shape, and Q2 with a green color and square shape. Two phylogenetic trees were included: without taxon names assigned in order to compare the populations from STRUCTURE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g007">Fig 7C</xref>), and the traditional rectangular phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s011">S7 Fig</xref>). The phylogenetic trees from MEGA 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g007">Fig 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s011">S7 Fig</xref>), were well consistent with the structure populations Q1 and Q2 developed in STRUCTURE 2.3.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>), indicating that there were two differentiated genetic populations in the 343 spinach genotypes panel, which was divided distinctly into two clusters with exceptions.</p>
<p>Besides the two structured populations inferred using the STRUCTURE analysis, the second highest peak of delta K was observed at K = 4 using Structure Harvester, indicating the 343 spinach genotypes can be also divided into four population clusters (Q1 to Q4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g008">Fig 8B</xref> shows the bar plot drawn in STRUCTURE to visualize the three populations, where Q1 is red; Q2 is green; Q3 is blue; Q4 is yellow, and the admixture of the three populations is represented by black empty squares. The classification of the germplasm accessions into populations according with the model-based structure developed in STRUCTURE 2.3.4 was shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g008">Fig 8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s001">S1 Table</xref>. Each spinach genotype was also assigned to one of the four populations based on probabilities calculated in STRUCTURE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s001">S1 Table</xref>). A Q value = 0.5 was used to divide the three clusters and the admixture. In total, 331 out of 343 accessions (96.5%) were assigned to one of the four populations, Q1 to Q4. Q1 to Q4 consisted of 215, 33, 20, and 63 accessions with 62.7%, 9.6%, 5.8%, and 18.4%, respectively. The remaining 12 accessions (3.5%) were categorized as having admixed ancestry between Q1 to Q4 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188745.t003">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Based on the four structured populations (Q1 to Q4), Q1 consisted of mainly germplasm accessions (97.7%); Q2 included the Arkansas lines (90.9%) and hybrids F1 (9.1%) without any germplasm accession; Q3 was mainly from Asia (90%); and Q4 had mainly F1 (52.4%) and America germplasm (33.3%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188745.t003">Table 3</xref>), indicating that Arkansas lines and hybrids had different genetic background and formed one cluster Q2; Asia accessions had special genetic background different from others; and the commercial hybrids had the genetic backgrounds closer Arkansas lines or America germplasm. For each grouped region, the majority of Asia accessions was Q1 with 67.6% but it had a quarter (24.3%) go to Q3; the America had half to Q1 and half to Q4; almost all Turkey (98.8%) and majority of Europe (93.4%) to Q1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188745.t003">Table 3</xref>), indicating that the spinach population structure was associated with grouped regions and further showed that there was a geographic effect for spinach genetic diversity.</p>

The same approaches and methods were also used to analyze genetic diversity of the four structured populations using MEGA 6.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, three collections of spinach germplasm was used: 268 USDA GRIN spinach germplasm accessions originally collected from 30 countries, 45 commercial spinach F1 hybrids from three countries, and 30 US Arkansas spinach cultivars and breeding lines (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188745.t001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188745.t002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188745.t003">3</xref>, and Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s001">S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s002">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s003">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s004">S4</xref> Tables). The results from this study showed that there was genetic variations among the 343 spinach genotypes examined. The data indicated that the genetic diversity and population structures were associated with geography–region and country; and the US Arkansas spinach cultivars/lines had a unique genetic background.</p>

<title>Genetic variation and population structure</title>
<p>In this study, spinach population structure was examined among 343 world-wide spinach genotypes from three spinach collections using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo iterations in STRUCTURE 2. The structured populations (clusters) were determined by the maximum value of the delta K and also the second greatest value (the second highest peak) of delta K was also used to access the populations. At the same time, the structured populations (clusters) from STRUCTURE 2 were confirmed by the ML method in MEGA 6.</p>
<p>The 268 USDA GRIN spinach germplasm accessions can be divided into two larger structured populations (Q1 and Q2 clusters plus the admixture) or into five structured subpopulations (Q1 to Q5 plus admixture). Based on the two broader structured populations (Q1 and Q2) in the 268 USDA germplasm accessions, Q1 consisted of germplasm mainly from Asia and the Q2 from Europe. The majority of America germplasm belonged to Q2.</p>
<p>Based on the demarcation of the five structured populations (Q to Q5), Asia material largely belonged to Q1; America to Q3; European (excluding Turkey) to Q2; Turkey to Q4 and other material from Europe to Q5, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188745.t002">Table 2</xref> middle). Regardless of the resolution for the 268 spinach germplasm accessions as two or as five structured populations or clusters, the majority of Asia accessions went to a distinct cluster separately from the accessions from America and Europe. In addition, the five structured populations (clusters) can distinguish America from others because 60.9% of Q3 were America and also 73.7% of America was grouped to Q3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188745.t003">Table 3</xref> bottom). We also observed that the majority of Q2 was Europe without any from Turkey, indicating that the Turkey spinach genotypes had different genetic background from other Europe genotypes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188745.t003">Table 3</xref> bottom).</p>
<p>The 45 F1 commercial hybrids could be grouped into two or three structured populations (clusters) (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s007">S3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s008">S4</xref> Figs, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188745.t003">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s003">S3 Table</xref>) and the results showed these F1 hybrids from the various companies had similarity genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s007">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s008">S4</xref> Figs), but each cluster had spinach genotypes from different companies.</p>
<p>There were two broader or four structured populations (clusters) among the 343 world-wide spinach genotypes tested (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g007">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g008">8</xref>, and Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s011">S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s012">S8</xref> Figs, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188745.t003">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Regardless if there were two or four clusters demarcated, the commercial F1 hybrids and the Arkansas lines were grouped into different clusters from the USDA germplasm. Therefore, the genetic backgrounds in commercial F1 hybrids and in Arkansas cultivar/lines have been improved for cultivation and the F1 hybrids and Arkansas lines were merged together and separately from the USDA germplasm, which was also confirmed by the phylogenetic analysis from regions and countries (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g006">6</xref>). The population structure analysis also demarcated the hybrids and Arkansas lines from USDA GRIN germplasm (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188745.t003">Table 3</xref>) where both F1 and Arkansas lines made up 87.7% (50/57) of Q2 if two clusters were demarcated and also made up 100% in Q2 if four clusters (populations) were demarcated.</p>
<p>For USDA spinach germplasm, we did population structure analysis and had phylogenetic trees among around 300 accessions during our association studies for leafminer (<italic>Liriomyza langei</italic>) resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref036">36</xref>], oxalate concentration in leaf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref037">37</xref>], leaf traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref038">38</xref>], and Stemphylium leaf spot (<italic>Stemphylium botryosum</italic> f. sp. <italic>spinacia</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref039">39</xref>] using SNPs from GBS approach and aimed to create the Q-matrix to be used in TASSEL for association analysis. Shi and Mou (2016) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref036">36</xref>] accessed 300 USDA spinach germplasm for their population structure using 783 SNPs from GBS and two structured populations were postulated and used for association analysis of leafminer (<italic>Liriomyza langei</italic>) resistance. Shi et al. (2016) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref037">37</xref>] also had two structured populations among 300 USDA spinach germplasm estimated using 841 SNPs for association study in oxalate concentration. Ma et al. (2016) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref038">38</xref>] postulated five structured populations among 323 USDA spinach germplasm accessions using 4077 SNPs and the five structured populations were used for association analysis of leaf traits, surface texture (smooth, savoy or semisavoy), petiole color (different shades of green vs. purple) and edge shape (serrate vs. entire) in spinach. Shi et al. (2016) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref039">39</xref>] accessed 273 USDA spinach germplasm accessions using 787 SNPs and both two and five structured populations were estimated and used for association analysis for Stemphylium leaf spot (<italic>Stemphylium botryosum</italic> f. sp. <italic>spinacia</italic>) resistance in spinach. In previous studies, both two and five structured populations in USDA germplasm accessions were postulated and used in association studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref039">39</xref>], similar to the results in this research. In additions, the population structure and phylogeny analysis were also conducted by regions and country in current research.</p>
<p>Currently, there are around 400 spinach germplasm accessions available in USDA GRIN and we plan to do whole genome resequencing (WGR) with 6X coverage of the spinach genome in the 400 accessions. Besides the AYZV02, the new released spinach genome LZYP01 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/LZYP01" xlink:type="simple">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/LZYP01</ext-link>) with 88% genome coverage, and newest one in Allen van Deynze’s lab in UC Davis with six assembly genomes (six chromosomes) completely genome sequences (unpublished, personal communication) when publicly available will be used as reference for SNP call in our future research. Our current results in this article were good enough for the genetic diversity analysis of spinach using the SNP set and it is valuable to be published. This current version of our article has been the first one to examine genetic diversity in a USDA worldwide spinach germplasm collection with more than 200 accessions using a large set of molecular markers in spinach. Similar research for spinach genetic diversity was reported by Xu et al (2017) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref016">16</xref>] among 120 cultivated and wild spinach accessions. However, only 51 spinach accessions were included from USDA GRIN. Among the 51 accessions, 25 accessions were crossed both reports in Xu et al (2017) and our current one. A total of 268 USDA germplasm accessions were included in our study with more spinach origin regions.</p>

<title>Genetic diversity by geography–region and country</title>
<p>Spinach genetic diversity was associated with geographic origin–region and country, but there were some exceptions. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the three regions, ‘Asia’, ‘Europe’, and ‘America’ in this study, the spinach lines from Europe were more similar to those from Asia than from America (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The phylogenetic analysis based on the 12 countries where 6 or more spinach accessions were available, indicated that the materials from all five Asia countries (Afghanistan, China, India, Iran, and Japan) merged together into the same cluster; three Europe countries (Hungary, Macedonia, and Netherlands) merged together to form a single cluster; and the America material belonged to another cluster which was similar to the F1 hybrids and AR lines; but there was materials from Turkey and Belgium that represented exceptions and belonged to the Asia cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g006">Fig 6</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on individual spinach lines, most of material from China, Japan, India, and Afghanistan merged together; most of Turkish lines grouped together; and most of lines from America merged together (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s005">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s006">S2</xref> Figs). Wu et al. (2013) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref013">13</xref>] also reported that there was a geographic effect existing in spinach genotypes based on 110 spinach germplasm accessions collected from different geographical origins in European, America, West Asia, East Asia, Northern China, Southern China and Japan and concluded that Northern and Southern Chinese spinach populations may have different origins from others. Xu et al (2017) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref016">16</xref>] also reported there was geographic origin effect among the 120 spinach accessions tested and founded the cultivars from East Asia and Chinese commercial varieties cultivars different from those from Central/West Asia, Europe, North America and Africa. However, Hu et al. (2007) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref011">11</xref>] indicated that the genetic relationships were not highly associated with the geographic locations based on 38 germplasm accessions and 10 commercial hybrids of spinach. The phylogenetic analysis based on 268 USDA GRIN spinach germplasm accessions in this study indicated that the spinach genetic diversity was associated with geographic origin–region and country.</p>

<title>Special background existed in Arkansas spinach cultivars/lines</title>
<p>The spinach breeding program at the University of Arkansas has a long history, having been initiated over 40 years ago, and was one of the first public sector spinach breeding programs in the United States. The major breeding contributions have been in the areas of disease resistant cultivars, particularly to white rust, such as ‘Fallgreen’ released in 1987 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref040">40</xref>] (Goode et al., 1988), ‘F380’ released in 1998 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref041">41</xref>] (Morelock et al. 2005, Morelock and Correll 2008), ‘Wintergreen’ released in 2003, and F415 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188745.ref005">5</xref>] (Morelock et al. 2005). These are some of the most highly resistant genotypes to white rust, and have been widely used as germplasm for white rust resistance and as inbred parents by seed companies to develop resistant hybrids.</p>
<p>All 30 Arkansas lines merged together in the phylogenetic trees of all 343 spinach genotypes tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s011">S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188745.s012">S8</xref> Figs) regardless there were two or four structured populations demarcated. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, the Arkansan lines F1 commercial hybrids were similar to the Arkansas lines. Based on region and country, the Arkansas lines were closer to America commercial F1 hybrids and then Netherlands F1 hybrids (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188745.g006">6</xref>). From these results, we can concluded that the Arkansas lines had uniform and unique genetic background likely as a result of selection for white rust resistance. It also confirms that the Arkansas spinach breeding lines have been widely used as germplasm for white rust resistance and as inbred parents by seed companies to develop resistant hybrids. However, the selection process also has contributed to the Arkansas spinach lines having a relatively narrow genetic background. Thus it would be valuable for the Arkansas spinach breeding program to introduce spinach genotypes with different genetic background to develop broader genetic diversity and select for a wider range of desirable traits.</p>
