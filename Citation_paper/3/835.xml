        <p>The microbiota in the human gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is highly exposed to antibiotics, and may be an important reservoir of resistant strains and transferable resistance genes. Maternal GIT strains can be transmitted to the offspring, and resistances could be acquired from birth. This is a case study using a metagenomic approach to determine the diversity of microorganisms conferring tetracycline resistance (Tc<sup>r</sup>) in the guts of a healthy mother-infant pair one month after childbirth, and to investigate the potential for horizontal transfer and maternal transmission of Tc<sup>r</sup> genes. Fecal fosmid libraries were functionally screened for Tc<sup>r</sup>, and further PCR-screened for specific Tc<sup>r</sup> genes. Tc<sup>r</sup> fosmid inserts were sequenced at both ends to establish bacterial diversity. Mother and infant libraries contained Tc<sup>r</sup>, although encoded by different genes and organisms. Tc<sup>r</sup> organisms in the mother consisted mainly of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, and the main gene detected was <italic>tet</italic>(O), although <italic>tet</italic>(W) and <italic>tet</italic>(X) were also found. Identical Tc<sup>r</sup> gene sequences were present in different bacterial families and even phyla, which may indicate horizontal transfer within the maternal GIT. In the infant library, Tc<sup>r</sup> was present exclusively in streptococci carrying <italic>tet</italic>(M), <italic>tet</italic>(L) and <italic>erm</italic>(T) within a novel composite transposon, Tn<italic>6079</italic>. This transposon belongs to a family of broad host range conjugative elements, implying a potential for the joint spread of tetracycline and erythromycin resistance within the infant's gut. In addition, although not found in the infant metagenomic library, <italic>tet</italic>(O) and <italic>tet</italic>(W) could be detected in the uncloned DNA purified from the infant fecal sample. This is the first study to reveal the diversity of Tc<sup>r</sup> bacteria in the human gut, to detect a likely transmission of antibiotic resistance from mother to infant GITs and to indicate the possible occurrence of gene transfers among distantly related bacteria coinhabiting the GIT of the same individual.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The human gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is host to a very dense microbiota, harboring 10<sup>13</sup>–10<sup>14</sup> bacterial cells in adults and a broad diversity of bacterial species, of which a large proportion are not yet cultured. This microbiota is often exposed to a variety of antibiotics, both directly and indirectly, due to their routine use in clinical settings and in farm animals. Therefore, its many other fundamental roles in health notwithstanding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Schumann1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Turnbaugh1">[5]</xref>, the GIT microbiota may serve as an important reservoir of antibiotic resistant strains that could act as opportunistic pathogens or as donors of resistance genes to other bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Salyers1">[6]</xref>. In infants, infections due to antibiotic resistant strains are on the rise and represent a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Although the infant's gut is thought to be mostly germ-free at birth, it rapidly enters an extensive and complex process of colonization by a variety of microbes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Favier1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Palmer1">[8]</xref>, and recent studies have firmly established that strains from the mother's GIT can be transmitted to the infant and persist during the first weeks of life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Vaishampayan1">[9]</xref>. Consequently, antibiotic resistances could be vertically transmitted from the maternal GIT and bear on infant health from a very early age.</p>
      <p>Tetracyclines are one of the most widely used groups of antibiotics worldwide and tetracycline resistance (Tc<sup>r</sup>) is extremely common among bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Roberts1">[10]</xref>. Presently, 43 distinct Tc<sup>r</sup> genes are known and they are usually associated with large mobile genetic elements (MGE) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://faculty.washington.edu/marilynr/" xlink:type="simple">http://faculty.washington.edu/marilynr/</ext-link>). The most common forms are the active efflux of tetracycline from the cell and the synthesis of ribosomal protection proteins that prevent the binding of tetracycline to the ribosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Roberts1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Chopra1">[11]</xref>. Although its medical applications have decreased in the last decade and it is no longer used for treatment of pregnant women or children under the age of 8 years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-American1">[12]</xref>, tetracycline is still widely used for therapeutic treatment in animal production and in some countries it is also used as growth promoter in animal feed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Chopra1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Roberts2">[13]</xref>. Therefore intestinal bacteria are still extensively exposed to this antibiotic.</p>
      <p>A recent microarray-based study has found <italic>tet</italic>(M) and <italic>tet</italic>(W) to be the most prevalent Tc<sup>r</sup> genes for the oral and fecal metagenomes of healthy adults, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Seville1">[14]</xref>. Furthermore, Tc<sup>r</sup> genes like <italic>tet</italic>(M), <italic>tet</italic>(O) and <italic>tet</italic>(W) have also been detected in fecal samples from healthy and exclusively breast-fed infants, suggesting that Tc<sup>r</sup> genes are common in the environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Gueimonde1">[15]</xref>. However, these studies have not revealed the types of bacteria that harbor these resistances in the GIT and have not addressed the potential origin of the Tc<sup>r</sup> genes and strains present in healthy infants. Here, we have used a culture-independent approach to characterize the diversity of microorganisms conferring Tc<sup>r</sup> in the gut of one healthy infant-mother pair. Two fecal metagenomic libraries, one from the mother and one from her exclusively breast-fed infant one month after birth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Vaishampayan1">[9]</xref>, were screened for fosmid clones conferring Tc<sup>r</sup>, which were further screened by PCR for a battery of Tc<sup>r</sup> genes. End-sequencing established the microbial diversity among the Tc<sup>r</sup> organisms. Finally we identified a novel Tn<italic>916</italic>-like conjugative transposon, Tn<italic>6079</italic> carrying Tc<sup>r</sup> resistance genes <italic>tet</italic>(M) and <italic>tet</italic>(L) and the erythromycin resistance gene <italic>erm</italic>(T) in the infant gut.</p>

        <title>Screening metagenome libraries from infant and mother for clones conferring Tc<sup>r</sup></title>
        <p>The metagenome libraries from the infant and the mother contained 44 and 272 fosmid Tc<sup>r</sup> clones respectively. In a first instance, we screened all obtained Tc<sup>r</sup> clones for the common ribosomal protection genes <italic>tet</italic>(M), <italic>tet</italic>(O), <italic>tet</italic>(W) and <italic>tet</italic>(S). Out of the 44 Tc<sup>r</sup> fosmid clones from the infant library, 43 were shown to be positive for <italic>tet</italic>(M) by PCR. One of the end-sequences (B04-U-PCC1R, 386 bp) from the fosmid clone negative for the <italic>tet</italic>(M) PCR was identical to a region in <italic>tet</italic>(M) downstream of one of the screening primers. Thus all 44 Tc<sup>r</sup> clones from the infant's metagenomic library were <italic>tet</italic>(M) positive and negative for <italic>tet</italic>(S), <italic>tet</italic>(O) and <italic>tet</italic>(W). In contrast, out of the 272 Tc<sup>r</sup> clones from the mother library, 21 (7.7%) were only positive for <italic>tet</italic>(W) and 204 (75%) were only positive for <italic>tet</italic>(O); for 47 (17.3%) of the Tc<sup>r</sup> clones none of the assayed Tc<sup>r</sup> genes were detected, and all clones were negative for <italic>tet</italic>(M) and <italic>tet</italic>(S).</p>
        <p>To further investigate what resistance genes might be present in the 47 maternal clones that were negative for <italic>tet</italic>(M), <italic>tet</italic>(O), <italic>tet</italic>(W) and <italic>tet</italic>(S), we performed a series of multiplex PCRs designed to detect <italic>tet</italic>(A), <italic>tet</italic>(B), <italic>tet</italic>(C), <italic>tet</italic>(D), <italic>tet</italic>(E), <italic>tet</italic>(G), <italic>tet</italic>(K), <italic>tet</italic>(L), <italic>tet</italic>A(P), <italic>tet</italic>(Q) and <italic>tet</italic>(X). This second round of PCR screening detected <italic>tet</italic>(X), encoding a tetracycline-inactivating enzyme, in 17 of the tested clones and none of the other genes assayed. Overall, our PCR screens were able to account for the Tc<sup>r</sup> genes present in 242 (89%) of the Tc<sup>r</sup> clones from the mother's metagenomic library.</p>
        <p>Sequencing of all the PCR screening products for <italic>tet</italic>(M) detected in the infant library identified a single sequence type, <italic>tet</italic>(M)a, based on 505 bp out of the 1920 bp of the <italic>tet</italic>(M) gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021644.s005">Table S1</xref>). All 21 <italic>tet</italic>(W) PCR screening products, 63 of the 204 products for <italic>tet</italic>(O) and 12 of the 17 <italic>tet</italic>(X) products from the maternal library were also sequenced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021644.s006">Table S2</xref>). Of the sequenced <italic>tet</italic>(O) products, 13 were selected to represent genes assigned to different families/genera (see later in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> section) and the remaining 50 were randomly selected. Based on 609 bp and 499 bp out of the 1920 bp of <italic>tet</italic>(W) and <italic>tet</italic>(O) and 446 bp out of the 1161–1167 bp of <italic>tet</italic>(X), 2 (<italic>tet</italic>(W)a, b), 9 (<italic>tet</italic>(O)a–i) and 1 (<italic>tet</italic>(X)a) different sequence types were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021644.s006">Table S2</xref>). The sequenced PCR screening products, <italic>tet</italic>(M)a and <italic>tet</italic>(O)a–i could discriminate among the known variants of <italic>tet</italic>(M) and <italic>tet</italic>(O) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021644.s001">Fig. S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021644.s002">S2</xref>). <italic>tet</italic>(W)a and <italic>tet</italic>(W)b could discriminate between groups with highly related <italic>tet</italic>(W) genes sharing 99.9–100% and 99.5–100% sequence identity, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021644.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). <italic>tet</italic>(X)a could discriminate among most known variants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021644.s004">Fig. S4</xref>) and was identical to the corresponding fragments from two <italic>tet</italic>(X) genes identified in <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, including the <italic>tet</italic>(X) gene first detected in transposon Tn<italic>4351</italic>/Tn<italic>4400</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Speer1">[16]</xref>.</p>

        <title>PCR screening of the infant's fecal DNA for the presence of <italic>tet</italic>(W), <italic>tet</italic>(O) and <italic>tet</italic>(X)</title>
        <p>Although <italic>tet</italic>(W), <italic>tet</italic>(O) and <italic>tet</italic>(X) were not detected in the infant's metagenomic library, these genes could nonetheless have been present in the infant GIT microbiome, perhaps in non-abundant species that were not captured in the library. To further investigate the possibility of maternal transmission of resistances to the infant, we PCR-screened the total DNA from the infant fecal sample from which the metagenomic library was constructed. <italic>tet</italic>(X) was not detected, but, remarkably, we obtained amplifications in both the <italic>tet</italic>(W) and the <italic>tet</italic>(O) screening PCR's, albeit the <italic>tet</italic>(W) product could only be observed as a very faint band after a standard number of screening PCR cycles. Both products yielded clean sequence reads, indicating that single sequence types were present in the amplicons. These screening products (<italic>tet</italic>(W)_infant_plug and <italic>tet</italic>(O)_infant_plug) were shown to be identical to <italic>tet</italic>(W)a and <italic>tet</italic>(O)h detected in the maternal metagenomic library (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021644.s002">Fig. S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021644.s003">S3</xref>). This strongly indicates mother to infant transmission of specific <italic>tet</italic>(W) and <italic>tet</italic>(O) genes.</p>

        <p>In a sequenced fosmid from the infant library, <italic>tet</italic>(M) was found on a Tn<italic>916/1545</italic>-like transposon, a family of conjugative transposons that have an extremely broad host range <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Roberts3">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Rice1">[18]</xref>. The transposon was highly similar to a putative Tn<italic>916</italic>-like transposon identified in <italic>Streptococcus gallolyticus</italic> subsp. <italic>gallolyticus</italic> strain UCN34 (FN597254), isolated from an elderly endocarditis and colon cancer patient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Rusniok1">[19]</xref>, although the infant transposon was located at the 3′end of <italic>rpm</italic>G (predicted to encode protein L33 from the ribosomal 50S subunit), whereas the transposon from strain UCN34 was located in a putative peptidoglycan-linked protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021644-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Both transposons contained a second Tc<sup>r</sup> gene, <italic>tet</italic>(L), predicted to encode an efflux protein, closely linked to plasmid recombination/mobilization (<italic>pre/mob</italic>) and replication (<italic>rep</italic>) genes. A DNA fragment containing the Tn<italic>916-</italic>like <italic>orf</italic>12 as well as <italic>tet</italic>(M), <italic>tet</italic>(L), <italic>pre</italic>/<italic>mob</italic> and most of <italic>rep</italic>B (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021644-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) has also recently been deposited in GenBank (AEEL01000025, contig of 6541 bp) as part of the draft sequence of a Human Microbiome Project (HMP) strain characterized as <italic>S. bovis</italic> ATCC 700338 and isolated from the vagina. This fragment is 100% identical to the homologous region in the infant transposon. Additionally, another DNA fragment from the same <italic>S. bovis</italic> draft sequence (AEEL01000027, contig of 35283 bp) contained a region (1900 bp) with Tn<italic>916</italic>-like <italic>orf</italic>5, <italic>xis</italic> and <italic>int</italic> that was 100% identical with a homologous region in the infant transposon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021644-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). This Tn<italic>916</italic>-like region was located at the 3′end of putative transposase IS<italic>Sdy1</italic>. The infant transposon also contained a 3026 bp sequence encoding an erythromycin rRNA methylase gene, <italic>erm</italic>(T), surrounded by two putative IS<italic>1216</italic> transposase genes, not present in strain UCN34. This 3026 bp sequence was 100% identical, except for an additional 30 bp between the <italic>erm</italic>(T) leader and the second IS<italic>1216</italic> element (overall DNA identity of 99%), to a corresponding fragment from <italic>S. gallolyticus</italic> subsp. <italic>pasteurianus</italic> NTUH 7421 (AY894138) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Tsai1">[20]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021644-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).

        <p>In regards to the Tc<sup>r</sup> genes assayed in the mother, fosmids carrying <italic>tet</italic>(O) and <italic>tet</italic>(X) were assigned both within Bacteroidales and Clostridiales or to the group with no BLASTX hits (in this group both end-reads had lengths &gt;500 bp for 11/18 = 61.1% of fosmids positive for <italic>tet</italic>(O) and for 3/3 = 100% of fosmid positive for <italic>tet</italic>(X)). Fosmids carrying <italic>tet</italic>(W) were only assigned within Clostridiales except for one fosmid having both end-reads assigned to the group with no BLASTX hits (lengths of forward and reverse end-reads were 128 and 219 bp, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021644-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Remarkably, fosmids containing <italic>tet</italic>(W) sequences type (a) with 100% identity were assigned within different families of the Clostridiales (Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae and Clostridiaceae) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021644.s006">Table S2</xref>). In addition, fosmids harboring identical sequences of types <italic>tet</italic>(O)b, <italic>tet</italic>(O)c or <italic>tet</italic>(O)d were also assigned within different families of this order (<italic>tet</italic>(O)b and <italic>tet</italic>(O)d within Lachnospiraceae and Clostridiaceae, <italic>tet</italic>(O)c within Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae).

This may suggest that specific <italic>tet</italic>(W) and <italic>tet</italic>(O) genes have been horizontally transferred among different members of the Clostridiales and that specific <italic>tet</italic>(O) and <italic>tet</italic>(X) genes have transferred between bacteria belonging to different phyla.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This is a case study based on a functional screen for Tc<sup>r</sup> fosmid clones from two previously prepared metagenomic libraries representing the gut microbiota from an infant and his mother one month after childbirth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Vaishampayan1">[9]</xref>. In correspondence with the lower complexity in the infant gut microbiota compared to the mother, we detected much fewer Tc<sup>r</sup> fosmid clones in the infant metagenome than in the mother metagenome. The Tc<sup>r</sup> genes detected in the infant metagenomic library did not represent a subset of those found in the mother, but rather a completely distinct set, belonging to a different gene class and encoded by a different species. However, total fecal DNA from the infant sample was shown to also contain specific Tc<sup>r</sup> genes that were present in the maternal library (<italic>tet</italic>(W)a and <italic>tet</italic>(O)h), suggesting that these may have been transmitted from mother to son. Given that this DNA was not cloned, we can not determine the organisms that carried these genes in the infant, but phylogenetic assignment of maternal fosmids suggests that they may have been present in organisms belonging to the Clostridiales (and/or to <italic>Bacteroides</italic> in the case of <italic>tet</italic>(O)h).</p>
      <p>In the infant library, <italic>tet</italic>(M) and <italic>tet</italic>(L) were detected in all the Tc<sup>r</sup> fosmids whereas mainly <italic>tet</italic>(O) but also <italic>tet</italic>(W) and <italic>tet</italic>(X) were detected among the Tc<sup>r</sup> fosmids from the mother. Although the approach employed here can only detect Tc<sup>r</sup> genes that can be expressed in the <italic>E. coli</italic> library host, the prevalence of Tc<sup>r</sup> genes observed in this study is in general agreement with former culture-independent studies that analyzed Tc<sup>r</sup> in Europe directly by PCR or microarray hybridization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Seville1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Gueimonde1">[15]</xref>. These works detected the <italic>tet</italic>(M) genotype to be abundant in Finnish infant fecal samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Gueimonde1">[15]</xref> and <italic>tet</italic>(O) and <italic>tet</italic>(W) to be the most prevalent Tc<sup>r</sup> genes in fecal samples from adults in six different European countries as detected by microarray analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Seville1">[14]</xref>. In contrast, a functional metagenomic screen of antibiotic resistances in the gut of two adult individuals carried out in the USA (Boston, MA) recovered numerous <italic>tet</italic>(W) sequences but did not identify any <italic>tet</italic>(O) or <italic>tet</italic>(X) genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Sommer1">[24]</xref>. It is important to note that the screening approaches in this latter work and in our own study both require that Tc<sup>r</sup> can be expressed in the <italic>E. coli</italic> library host strains at a level sufficient to confer resistance in the presence of the antibiotic, although each employs a different cloning vector. Our fosmid-based study has the potential disadvantage that resistance genes located on smaller plasmids (&lt;40 kb) may not be represented in the metagenomic libraries, but, on the other hand, the larger insert size increases the likelihood to clone complete resistance genes and enables the recovery of complex genetic elements. The different results obtained in the two USA studies could be due to the different cloning systems and/or reflect the antibiotic concentrations used in the functional screenings (10 µg/ml tetracycline in our study versus 20 µg/ml tetracycline, oxytetracycline or minocycline in Sommer <italic>et al</italic>). In addition, functional screenings performed at even lower tetracycline concentrations might reveal further Tc<sup>r</sup> genes that are weakly expressed.</p>
      <p>The previous culture-independent analyses that identified Tc<sup>r</sup> in human fecal samples did not investigate the bacterial species in which such resistance was encoded <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Seville1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Gueimonde1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Sommer1">[24]</xref>. In our fosmid-based study, end-sequencing of fosmid inserts allowed for taxonomic identification of the resistant organisms present in the GIT of the two individuals analyzed. All infant Tc<sup>r</sup> clones appeared to represent the same <italic>Streptococcus</italic> genomic region containing <italic>tet</italic>(M), <italic>tet</italic>(L) and <italic>erm</italic>(T) within a novel composite Tn<italic>916</italic>-like transposon, Tn<italic>6079</italic>, located at the 3′end of <italic>rpm</italic>G. The nucleotide sequences of both <italic>rpm</italic>G and its 5′ neighbor <italic>rpm</italic>F were 100% identical to those of <italic>S. gallolyticus</italic> subsp. <italic>pasteurianus</italic> strain NTUH 7421, <italic>S. gallolyticus</italic> subsp. <italic>gallolyticus</italic> strain UCN34 and <italic>S. bovis</italic> ATCC 700338 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021644-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). It is important to note that the heterogenous group of strains traditionally designated <italic>S. bovis</italic> has recently been split by modern taxonomic techniques into the sister species <italic>S. gallolyticus</italic> and <italic>S. infantarius</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Beck1">[25]</xref>. Indeed, the 16S rRNA sequence of <italic>S. bovis</italic> ATCC 700338 shows 99 to 100% identity with the <italic>S. gallolyticus</italic> subsp. <italic>pasteurianus</italic> and <italic>S. gallolyticus</italic> subsp. <italic>gallolyticus</italic> 16S rRNA sequences currently available in GenBank. Therefore, the presence of <italic>rpm</italic>G and <italic>rpm</italic>F next to the Tn<italic>6079</italic> transposon in the sequenced infant fosmid allows for identification of the Tc<sup>r</sup>-carrying organism in the infant GIT to species level. The similarities in sequence and structure between Tn<italic>6079</italic> and corresponding MGE sequences in the <italic>S. gallolyticus</italic> subsp. <italic>pasteurianus</italic>, <italic>S. gallolyticus</italic> subsp. <italic>gallolyticus</italic> and <italic>S. bovis</italic> ATCC 700338 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021644-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) strongly suggest that the infant's composite transposon arose through a process involving intraspecific genetic exchange.</p>
      <p>Regarding the origin of the <italic>S. gallolyticus</italic>-like strain carrying the transposon in the infant, this organism was probably not transmitted from the maternal GIT, since no streptococci were detected in the mother's fecal samples, neither in the resistance screens performed here, nor in the previous random end sequencing of the library <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Vaishampayan1">[9]</xref>, even though this species is a normal inhabitant in the GIT of humans and animals and can be isolated in 5–16% of fecal samples from healthy adults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Alazmi1">[26]</xref>. Possible origins may include transmission from other maternal areas that are known to often harbor streptococci, such as the skin, the birth canal and the mouth, from breast milk, where streptococci have also recently been detected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Collado1">[27]</xref>, or from other individuals handling the infant. The 100% identities recovered between the sequenced fosmid insert and the vaginal strain <italic>S. bovis</italic> ATCC 700338 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021644-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) suggest that the infant may have acquired this strain or a closely related one during his passage through the birth canal.</p>
      <p>In the maternal library, microorganisms conferring Tc<sup>r</sup> consisted mainly of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, which commonly represent the two major Phyla of the human GIT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Eckburg1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Turroni1">[29]</xref> and were also the most represented in the fosmid library of the mother according to random end reads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Vaishampayan1">[9]</xref>. For 9.9% of the maternal Tc<sup>r</sup> fosmids, neither of the end-reads had any BLASTX hits against the NCBI non-redundant protein database in spite of being of substantial length (&gt;500 bp). These fosmids likely carry Tc<sup>r</sup> genes, mainly <italic>tet</italic>(O), from microorganisms for which no close relatives have yet been cultured. <italic>tet</italic>(O) was the main gene conferring resistance and was detected both within the Clostridiales (Firmicutes) and also the Bacteroidales (Bacteroidetes), where it had not been reported previously. Similarly, <italic>tet</italic>(X) was detected within the Clostridiales and the Bacteroidales and fosmids carrying identical <italic>tet</italic>(O) or <italic>tet</italic>(X) sequences were assigned within both phyla/orders. <italic>tet</italic>(W) was present only within Clostridiales, but also for this order fosmids carrying 100% identical <italic>tet</italic>(W) sequences were assigned within three different families (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021644.s006">Table S2</xref>). Sequence identity is not expected between genes that have been diverging as orthologs since the phylogenetic split between such distantly related bacteria and can therefore be interpreted as evidence of recent horizontal transfers among these organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Barbosa1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Shoemaker1">[32]</xref>. <italic>tet</italic>(W) genes and flanking sequences in different isolates of GIT bacteria from diverse hosts have also been shown to share a high degree of similarity in previous analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Kazimierczak1">[33]</xref>. However, this is the first time that exact sequences of an antibiotic resistance gene are shown to occur in distantly related bacteria naturally coexisting in the gut of a single person at a particular point in time. Although their coexistence does not prove that the horizontal transfers occurred in the GIT of the infant's mother, alternative explanations would still necessitate recent transfers, in the environment or in the GITs of other individuals, followed by colocalization of the bacteria in this individual's GIT. These scenarios would imply a high frequency of these exact sequences in nature and/or a high likelihood of colocalization of the bacteria carrying them, and therefore seem less parsimonious than <italic>in situ</italic> transfer among bacteria coexisting closely in the dense microbiota of the adult GIT. In addition to fosmids containing <italic>tet</italic>(O), <italic>tet</italic>(W) and <italic>tet</italic>(X), there was also a fraction of Tc<sup>r</sup> maternal fosmids in which none of the assayed genes were detected (11%, assigned within Firmicutes or Bacteroidetes), and where Tc<sup>r</sup> must have been conferred by rare resistance genes.</p>
      <p>This study showed strong indications of transmission of specific Tc<sup>r</sup> genes (<italic>tet</italic>(W)a and <italic>tet</italic>(O)h) from the mother's GIT to that of the infant. However, the third Tc<sup>r</sup> gene present in the maternal genomic library, <italic>tet</italic>(X), was not detected in the infant. <italic>tet</italic>(W)a and <italic>tet</italic>(O)h could be found in the infant's uncloned fecal DNA but not in the infant metagenomic library, suggesting that they were only present in low numbers. This is supported by the fact that PCR with <italic>tet</italic>(W) screening primers produced only a very faint band, and by the detection of a single <italic>tet</italic>(O) sequence type in the infant out of the 9 different types detected in the mother (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021644.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). The scarcity of maternal Tc<sup>r</sup> genes in the infant could be partially explained by the fact that approximately half of the detected Tc<sup>r</sup> in the mother library was encoded by clostridia, and previous analyses of random end sequences from these libraries showed that clostridia were not abundant in the mother and that they were not transmitted to the infant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Vaishampayan1">[9]</xref>. On the other hand, those analyses, as well as comparisons of fosmid sequences and <italic>Bacteroides</italic>-specific 16S PCR libraries, have shown transmission to the infant of the two <italic>Bacteroides</italic> phylotypes present in the mother <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Vaishampayan1">[9]</xref>. Given this established phylotype transmission, the fact that <italic>Bacteroides</italic> were amply represented in both the mother and infant libraries and the presence of <italic>tet</italic>(O)h and <italic>tet</italic>(X)a genes in <italic>Bacteroides</italic>-assigned maternal fosmids, the lack of <italic>Bacteroides</italic>-encoded Tc<sup>r</sup> in the infant's library suggests that 1) <italic>tet</italic>(O)h and/or <italic>tet</italic>(X)a were present in only a small fraction of the maternal <italic>Bacteroides</italic> population and/or that 2) <italic>tet</italic>(O)h- and <italic>tet</italic>(X)a-encoding <italic>Bacteroides</italic> were selected against during the transmission process or in the infant gut. In fact, the first proposition is likely true, as according to previous random end sequencing analyses, <italic>Bacteroides</italic> represent nearly 48% of the maternal fosmid clones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Vaishampayan1">[9]</xref>, and therefore hundreds of Tc<sup>r</sup>-encoding fosmids would be expected in a 69,000-clone library if <italic>tet</italic>(O)h and/or <italic>tet</italic>(X)a were present in every <italic>Bacteroides</italic> cell (based on a genome size of 6.5 Mb); in contrast, only 3 and 18 end-reads were assigned to Bacteroidetes among the mother clones containing <italic>tet</italic>(O)h and <italic>tet</italic>(X)a, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021644-g002">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021644.s006">Table S2</xref>).</p>
      <p>In summary, for the first time we have characterized the microbial diversity of Tc<sup>r</sup> bacteria in human gut samples, by analyzing GIT fosmid libraries from a mother and her infant. The maternal and infant libraries contained different resistant taxa encoding distinct sets of genes, but some of the specific Tc<sup>r</sup> genes present in the mother could be recovered from uncloned infant fecal DNA. This indicates that transmission of Tc<sup>r</sup> genes from the mother's GIT to the infant likely occurred, but that, due to the complexity of the GIT microbiota, species and genes present in low numbers were missed in the infant metagenomic library in spite of its large size (&gt;70,000 clones). The likely role of the human gut as a privileged environment for HGT has been previously recognized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Palmer1">[8]</xref>, but here we present the first documented cases of identical resistance genes that could be directly linked to distantly related bacteria coexisting in the GIT of the same individual. The finding of a transposon in the infant carrying <italic>tet</italic>(M), <italic>tet</italic>(L) and <italic>erm</italic>(T), belonging to a family of broad host-range transposons, implied a strong potential for the joint transfer of tetracycline and erythromycin resistance within the infant's gut. These findings reinforce the notion that the human GIT is currently a relevant environment for the spread of antibiotic resistances, even in the case of young infants that solely ingest maternal milk. Further analyses involving more mother-infant pairs will be required in order to establish whether the trends observed in this case study describe the general relationship between mother and infant antibiotic resistomes.</p>

        <p>The infant and mother metagenomic fosmid libraries analyzed consisted of approximately 76000 and 69100 clones, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Vaishampayan1">[9]</xref>. Fosmid inserts were approximately 40 kb, thus the infant and mother libraries represent roughly 3 Gb of DNA each. Clones from the infant and mother metagenomic fosmid libraries were pooled resulting in a reduction from 198 and 180 library (384 wells) plates to 14 and 12 (384 wells) master plates, respectively. Each master plate was constructed by pooling 15 library plates into one master plate using a Plate Mate Plus from Matrix. Each well in the master plates contained 30–40 µl LB (Millers) broth supplied with 7.5% Glycerol and 2 µl from each of the original library plates.</p>

        <p>One fosmid carrying <italic>tet</italic>(M) from the infant library (B04-M2) was sequenced as part of a mix of 12 fosmids pyrosequenced with Multiple Sequence Identifiers (MIDs) in a Roche GS FLX instrument in the Sequencing Technology group of the DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI), CA, USA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jgi.doe.gov/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.jgi.doe.gov/</ext-link>). Reads belonging to the B04-M2 fosmid were sorted out and assembled using the Roche 454 Newbler software. Seven contigs were generated of which five (lengths 23744 bp, 19861 bp, 6382 bp, 1578 bp and 809 bp) were used to assemble the fosmid sequence. The remaining two contigs (lengths 958 bp and 507 bp) were highly similar or identical to the <italic>E. coli</italic> host genome and therefore were not incorporated into the assembly. Ten sequencing primers, M1b, M2, M2b, M3, M4, M5, M6, C340F, C01F and C01R were designed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021644.s007">Table S3</xref>) and Sanger reads, produced by Macrogen, Korea, were used to close the remaining five gaps. FosmidMAX™ DNA Purification Kit (EPICENTRE, USA) was used to prepare fosmid DNA template for the Sanger sequencing reactions. A finished 53499 bp circular fosmid containing a 45066 bp insert was assembled.

        <title>Assignment of end-sequences</title>
        <p>All together 632 high quality sequences were used as queries to establish bacterial diversity through BLASTX searches against the NCBI non-redundant protein database (e-value&lt;e<sup>−15</sup>). End-sequencing has recently been validated as a reliable method of determining diversity in a metagenomic sample, as random sequence reads from fosmid libraries of human fecal samples provide results very similar to those obtained based on the analysis of 16S sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Manichanh2">[41]</xref>. Each of the two BLASTX results (mother and infant) were separately parsed and visualized using MEGAN (version 3.7.4) software (Min Score = 35, Min Score/Length = 0.15, Top Percent = 20, Min Support = 1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021644-Huson1">[42]</xref>. Min Score/Length = 0.15 was chosen in order to account for the different read lengths. Because end-sequences located in MGE could easily bias the bacterial assignment by MEGAN, the BLASTX results were parsed for reads with hits containing the regular expressions <italic>conjugative</italic>, <italic>transposon</italic>, <italic>tn916</italic>, <italic>integrase</italic>, <italic>recombinase</italic>, <italic>excisionase</italic>, <italic>mobilization</italic> and <italic>resistance</italic>, and if such reads were assigned below order-level they were manually removed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021644.s008">Tables S4</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021644.s009">S5</xref>). Additionally, 4 infant end-reads (B04-M19-PCC1F, B04-M20-PCC1F, B04-M29- PCC1R, B04-M33-PCC1R) that were not found by the parsing of the BLASTX result but mapped to ORFs in the sequenced transposon were also removed. The assignment of reads by MEGAN based only on one BLASTX hit is very sensitive to misclassified sequences in GenBank. Therefore the taxonomical classification of BLASTX hit sequences used by MEGAN to assign reads at species level was reviewed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021644.s010">Tables S6</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021644.s011">S7</xref>).
