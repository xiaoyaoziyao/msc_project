          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Humanized mice generate a lymphoid system of human origin subsequent to transplantation of human CD34+ cells and thus are highly susceptible to HIV infection. Here we examined the efficacy of antiretroviral treatment (ART) when added to food pellets, and of long-acting (LA) antiretroviral compounds, either as monotherapy or in combination. These studies shall be inspiring for establishing a gold standard of ART, which is easy to administer and well supported by the mice, and for subsequent studies such as latency. Furthermore, they should disclose whether viral breakthrough and emergence of resistance occurs similar as in HIV-infected patients when ART is insufficient.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>NOD/shi-scid/Œ≥<sub>c</sub>null (NOG) mice were used in all experimentations. We first performed pharmacokinetic studies of the drugs used, either added to food pellets (AZT, TDF, 3TC, RTV) or in a LA formulation that permitted once weekly subcutaneous administration (TMC278: non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, TMC181: protease inhibitor). A combination of 3TC, TDF and TMC278-LA or 3TC, TDF, TMC278-LA and TMC181-LA suppressed the viral load to undetectable levels in 15/19 (79%) and 14/14 (100%) mice, respectively. In successfully treated mice, subsequent monotherapy with TMC278-LA resulted in viral breakthrough; in contrast, the two LA compounds together prevented viral breakthrough. Resistance mutations matched the mutations most commonly observed in HIV patients failing therapy. Importantly, viral rebound after interruption of ART, presence of HIV DNA in successfully treated mice and in vitro reactivation of early HIV transcripts point to an existing latent HIV reservoir.</p>

          <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
          <p>This report is a unique description of multiple aspects of HIV infection in humanized mice that comprised efficacy testing of various treatment regimens, including LA compounds, resistance mutation analysis as well as viral rebound after treatment interruption. Humanized mice will be highly valuable for exploring the antiviral potency of new compounds or compounds targeting the latent HIV reservoir.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The HIV pandemic continues to spread. Even in the United States and Europe with their relative universal access to combined anti-retroviral treatment (ART), the prevalence of HIV-infected people is increasing. The 2nd and 3rd generation antivirals are very efficacious. The life expectancy of treated HIV-infected individuals has significantly improved over the last two decades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Walensky1">[1]</xref> and, in turn, has contributed to the increasing prevalence. However, ART has significant shortcomings, including adverse events, psychological dependence, life-long adherence and cost. Incomplete adherence results in the emergence of drug-resistant HIV strains. Novel and simpler treatment strategies and, in the best-case scenario, a cure are needed.</p>
      <p>The HIV pandemic started with an ancestral SIV from a non-human primate crossing into humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Heeney1">[2]</xref>, and thus, it is not surprising that HIV replication is limited to human and non-human primate cells. Mouse models of HIV infection have been generated by engrafting human lymphoid tissue into SCID mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-McCune1">[3]</xref> and are receptive to HIV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Namikawa1">[4]</xref>. For example, SCID mice transplanted with fetal liver (liv) and thymus (thy) tissue were very valuable for studying various aspects of HIV pathogenesis, including HIV-induced pathology in the thy/liv implant, screening anti-viral compounds and hematopoietic stem cell‚Äìbased gene therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Bonyhadi1">[5]</xref>. However, these studies are limited to the thy/liv implant.</p>
      <p>Development of a human adaptive immune system in cord blood cell‚Äìtransplanted mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Traggiai1">[6]</xref> renewed the interest in humanized mice (hu mice): hematopoietic CD34+ cells were preferentially transplanted into the liver of newborn mice or i.v. at older age. The mice develop a lymphoid-like system of human origin with T and B cells, monocytes, plasmacytoid and conventional DCs, thymus and lymph nodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Jiang1">[7]</xref>. Their mature T cells have a broad VŒ≤ repertoire, and more than 40% of T cells display a naive phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Traggiai1">[6]</xref>. This breakthrough was only realized through the development of heavily immunodeficient mice by crossing of SCID mice with non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice and mice deficient in the gamma c (Œ≥<sub>c</sub>) chain of the IL-2 receptor or the generation of Rag1 or 2‚àí/‚àí Œ≥<sub>c</sub>‚àí/‚àí knock-out mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Shultz1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We and others demonstrated that these hu mice are highly permissive to HIV infection when challenged with CCR5- or CXCR4-tropic HIV strains and show viral dissemination and progressive CD4+ T-cell loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Baenziger1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Berges1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Watanabe1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Zhang1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Gorantla1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To validate the experimental significance of hu mice for studying HIV pathogenesis and their value for novel interventional approaches, key aspects of HIV infection/pathogenesis must be fulfilled. The model should recapitulate ART of disseminated HIV infection with subsequent recovery of the immune system; interruption of ART should result in a rebound of HIV replication from the latent reservoir. Five studies reported the effects of ART in HIV-infected humanized mice using different drugs and drug combinations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Sango1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Choudhary1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Choudhary2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Denton1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Marsden1">[18]</xref>. While these reports are very promising that humanized mice may be the long awaited small animal model for preclinical proof-of-concept studies, they lack pharmacokinetic (PK) studies for the medicinal compounds used except for the report by Choudhary et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Choudhary1">[15]</xref> that would help to compare the data obtained in humanized mice to a clinical context.</p>
      <p>A ‚Äústandardized" ART scheme that completely suppresses HIV RNA replication in hu mice would be highly valuable for pre-clinical proof-of-concept studies for novel anti-retroviral compounds and studies of latency that closely approximate the situation in HIV-infected humans treated with ART.</p>
      <p>Thus, we sought to determine if this mouse model is valuable for studying antiretroviral treatment of disseminated HIV infection and if it recapitulates key features, such as viral rebound, break-through replication and viral rebound subsequent to interruption of ART. We made a major effort to define the dose of antiretroviral compounds added to the food pellets to compare data to human studies. We also benefited from access to antiretroviral compounds in special formulation that permit once weekly dosing in mice. Thus, we also were able to study a novel concept of anti-HIV therapy based on LA antiretroviral drugs.</p>

        <p>The easiest and most convenient way for long-term ART in hu mice would be to add the ART to the food pellets. Mice have a higher metabolism than humans, and thus, we converted the dose of the distinct compounds used in humans by a formula as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-ReaganShaw1">[21]</xref>. The dose calculated was 61.7 mg/kg/day for 3TC and for TDF, considering food uptake of 3‚Äì4 g/d for a hu mouse with a body weight of 20‚Äì30 g. We generated food pellets containing 0.5 mg of 3TC and TDF per g of food. 3TC and TDF belong to the group of nucleoside resp. nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).</p>
        <p>PK data validated this approach showing plasma levels in the therapeutic range over the entire observation period with fluctuations due to the wake-sleep cycle of the mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038853-g001">Fig. 1A‚ÄìD</xref>). In contrast, azidothymidine (AZT) at 0.5 mg/g of food and ritonavir (RTV) at 1 mg/g of food gave toxic concentrations clearly above the therapeutic range or sub-inhibitory concentrations, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038853.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The plasma concentration of TMC278-LA and TMC181-LA (at the higher dose) was still clearly above the target concentration (C<sub>target</sub>) even 14 days after s.c. injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038853-g001">Fig. 1E‚ÄìF</xref>). TMC278 is the recently approved non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) rilpivirine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Schrijvers1">[22]</xref>, and TMC181 is a pre-clinical-stage protease inhibitor (PI) belonging to the same chemical class as TMC114 (darunavir), but displaying better potency while preserving similarly high resistance coverage. The PK data of the long-acting drugs permitted a once weekly application in mice.</p>

        <title>HIV RNA plasma level is suppressed by ART and promptly rebounds with treatment interruption</title>
        <p>In a pilot experiment, uninfected mice appeared to tolerate AZT, 3TC and RTV well. Thus, while awaiting the PK data of these compounds, we started a first experiment to examine ART in HIV-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038853-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Mice before ART had an HIV RNA baseline of 10<sup>4.9</sup>¬±10<sup>5.2</sup> copies/ml (avg ¬± std). Unexpectedly, the treated mice developed wasting within 2 weeks, which we attributed to the ART and, in particular, AZT. We therefore changed the ART immediately to TDF, 3TC and TMC278-LA, and within 1 week, the mice recovered from the wasting disease. Importantly, within 4‚Äì8 weeks, 14/21 (66%) mice showed a decline of HIV RNA levels to under the detection limit of 800 copies/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038853-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). One mouse with detectable HIV RNA at that time showed suppressed HIV RNA when we bled it 72 days after start of ART (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038853-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Since we switched the ART in two mice with detectable HIV RNA to monotherapy with TMC278-LA, we are not able to make any statement about their eventual response rate if the ART had been continued. Thus, the overall response rate to the ART (3TC/TDF/TMC278-LA) was 79% (15/19 mice).</p>

        <p>In an additional group of mice treated with AZT, 3TC and RTV, we found various laboratory disturbances, most prominent a very significant anemia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038853.s003">Figure S3</xref>). In concert with plasma AZT levels clearly above the therapeutic range, we attributed the wasting observed to AZT toxicity.</p>
        <p>Nearly all mice receiving the 2 weeks of AZT, 3TC and RTV treatment suffered from weight loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038853-g002">Fig. 2E and F</xref>). Remarkably, the mice with viral failure experienced more significant weight loss than the others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038853-g002">Fig. 2G</xref>). Mock-treated HIV-infected mice showed a very stable weight course with fluctuations of less than 2 g over time.</p>
        <p>We subsequently divided the mice with suppressed HIV RNA into two groups, seven mice were maintained on ART for another 5 weeks and, thereafter, treatment was interrupted. The other seven mice were treated by TMC278-LA alone. ART interruption resulted in viral rebound in all mice, indicating the existence of a latent reservoir, such as that in HIV-infected humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038853-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Monotherapy with TMC278-LA was insufficiently potent to suppress HIV RNA since 6/7 mice showed a breakthrough of viral replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038853-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p>
        <p>While there were no obvious symptoms or signs, we observed a higher mortality in mock-treated HIV infected mice than in ART treated mice. We associated this higher mortality with an unknown HIV-associated phenomenon. This mortality was usually less than 20% and thus when working with small numbers of mice, there may be divergence from this estimated mortality rate. In the 2nd set of experiments presented (see below), we had no loss due to ‚Äúspontaneous" mortality.</p>

Initial ART was with TDF, 3TC, TMC278-LA and TMC181-LA. In mice with documented HIV RNA below detection limit after 44 days of ART, we simplified the regimen as planned. The other mice that still showed a marked viremia were continued on the quadruple ART. The dual ART consisting of TMC278-LA and TMC181-LA given once weekly s.c. was really potent: all but one mouse (viral blip) had undetectable HIV RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038853-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>).

This variable decay rate in response to ART mirrors the distinct decay rate of HIV in patients starting ART.

        <title>In vitro reactivation of HIV transcripts in spleen specimens from hu mice in response to re-activating compounds</title>
        <p>In order to examine whether latently infected cells exist in hu mice, we examined unspliced HIV Gag mRNA transcripts in spleen specimens from HIV-infected mock- and vero-treated mice prior and after <italic>in vitro</italic> reactivation. Since we were limited in spleen specimens, we opted for a combination of mitogens in concert with anti-CD3/CD28 and IL-7 to increase our chances of successful reactivation.

Indeed, we did not observe any toxic effects 18 h after adding this cocktail when we harvested the tissue for quantifying HIV mRNA transcripts.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We sought to determine if hu mice recapitulate key features of HIV infection and treatment and to assess the value of long-acting anti-HIV drugs for treating HIV infection. We found that i) conventional ART with two NRTIs and a NNRTI efficiently suppressed HIV viral load and allowed recovery of the immune system; ii) cell-associated HIV DNA was still present in those mice, and interruption of ART resulted in viral rebound; <italic>in vitro</italic> reactivation of spleen specimens from successfully treated mice yielded increased number of HIV mRNA transcripts as compared to baseline; and iii) simplification of ART with two long-acting drugs kept HIV RNA suppressed. Thus, HIV infection in hu mice mirrors key features of HIV infection in humans, including high titer viremia in untreated mice, suppression of HIV RNA when treated with ART but emergence of resistance when treated with insufficient regimens, viral rebound after treatment interruption, and recovery of CD4+ T cells under ART. Thus, hu mice are a highly valuable animal model to assess the antiviral potency of new compounds or novel strategies to eradicate latent HIV.</p>
      <p>Liv/thy SCID hu mice have been used before to investigate novel compounds for their anti-HIV activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Bonyhadi1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Goldstein1">[24]</xref>. However, detailed PK data were mostly lacking, thus making it difficult to interpret the antiviral potency of the compounds. Furthermore, conventional liv/thy SCID hu mice lack peripheral T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-McCune1">[3]</xref>. Thus, SCID-hu Thy/Liv mice were rarely used to study compounds to treat disseminated HIV infection. Most studies administered the drugs either before or immediately after the HIV challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Stoddart1">[25]</xref>, and that recapitulates post- or pre-exposure prophylaxis where less potent regimens are already effective.</p>
      <p>The new generation of hu mice displays an elaborated lymphoid-like system of human origin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Traggiai1">[6]</xref> and is highly susceptible to HIV infection. However, studies with these mice lacked data about their value for standardized pre-clinical testing. Five studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Sango1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Choudhary1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Choudhary2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Denton1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Marsden1">[18]</xref> reported the efficacy of ART in HIV-infected mice. In these studies, ART was started within 3 weeks after HIV infection (i.e., rather early after HIV challenge). In the first study, HIV was suppressed in 3/6 mice by i.p. ART, and HIV recurred when treatment was interrupted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Choudhary1">[15]</xref>. Surprisingly, a second study did not observe viral rebound after treatment interruption <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Sango1">[14]</xref>. In subsequent studies, complete response rates were reported with an intensified regimen (i.p. administration of emtricitabine (FTC), TDF, an integrase inhibitor and enfuvirtide) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Choudhary2">[16]</xref> or high doses of ART given i.p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Denton1">[17]</xref>. All but one <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Choudhary2">[16]</xref> of these studies lack detailed PK data on the administered drugs and data related to long-term administration of ART and to the anti-HIV efficacy of ART in chronically infected mice. Compared to the PK data we generated in mice and considering the therapeutic range in humans, the dosages applied in some of the studies reported are most likely 3‚Äì5-fold over the therapeutic range.</p>
      <p>For an effective mouse model, long-term ART must be non-toxic and well tolerated by the mice. This requires solid PK data in the therapeutic range for humans. In our experiments, we added the distinct anti-HIV compounds to the food pellet based upon calculating food intake, weight and metabolic rate. We generated PK data in the therapeutic range for 3TC and TDF. The long-acting drugs TMC278-LA and TMC181-LA were injected s.c. once weekly. We identified dosages that resulted in concentrations clearly above the C<sub>target</sub> 1 week after its administration. Notably, plasma levels of NRTIs approximate only the concentration of the anti-HIV active intracellular tri-phosphorylated compounds. Since the half-life of the active moiety is longer than from the parental compound <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Bazzoli1">[26]</xref>, we were confident that the dosages would be efficacious for treating disseminated HIV infection in our model. Indeed, this was the case. We observed HIV RNA suppression in 79% in the first and 100% in the second experiment.</p>
      <p>From the PK data, the mice in the first experiment were treated for the first 2 weeks with only effective dosages of 3TC and AZT, a dual therapy insufficient to suppress HIV; RTV plasma levels were substantially below the therapeutic range. Furthermore, AZT which was toxic for the mice resulted in decreased food uptake that was reflected by substantial weight loss and sub-therapeutic dose levels. The emergence of drug-resistant HIV was a logical consequence of insufficient ART plasma levels. The observed M184I mutations in our study are the most prevalent among TDF/FTC-treated HIV individuals. Furthermore, we selected the TMC278 E138K resistance‚Äìassociated mutation in our mouse model. These findings demonstrate that our model consistently reproduced the Phase III trial results of the ECHO &amp; THRIVE studies, which showed that E138K and M184I combination was the most observed resistance associated mutations in patients treated with TMC278 and co-formulated TDF/FTC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Cohen1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Molina1">[28]</xref>. Indeed, our data indicate that the M184I mutation precedes the E138K mutation; this suggests that patients with archived HIV strains with the M184I are especially prone to viral failure with a subsequent triple compound‚Äìbased regimen with 3TC or FTC and TMC278. This mimics what happens in patients with poor adherence and emphasizes the preclinical proof-of concept value of this mouse model for HIV infection.</p>
      <p>HIV-infected mice displayed a distinct response rate to ART (i.e., around 50% of all mice under quadruple therapy had an undetectable HIV RNA at day 44, the other 50% at day 99) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038853-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Since we were limited in blood draws, we have no detailed data about the viral decay in these sets of mice. Notably, we observed a rapid drop of HIV RNA in a majority of HIV-infected mice within 10 days after initiation of ART when we took blood in short intervals (unpublished data). In any case, the response rate to ART may vary in HIV-infected hu mice similar to the variable response observed in HIV-infected individuals starting ART. It would be therefore sensible to perform HIV RNA measurements over at least 2 months to document ART response or failure.</p>
      <p>In our experiments, blood draws yielded small amounts, but terminal bleeds yields larger blood volumes, which are a critical determinant for the sensitivity of the Amplicor Roche¬Æ. Indeed, the larger blood volumes documented the success of ART with HIV RNA copy numbers below 60/ml in most mice, thus excluding that low-level viremia was still ongoing in the successfully treated animals.</p>
      <p>Interrupting ART resulted in prompt viral rebound in all mice. The mice used for that purpose successfully responded to ART and were treated for a longer period of time to assure the decay of potentially low-replicating cells. We also found cell-associated HIV proviral DNA in untreated and successfully treated mice, re-enforcing the fact that HIV generates a latent reservoir in HIV-infected hu mice. Besides, cell-associated HIV proviral DNA levels in untreated mice were higher than in treated ones, similar to the case in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Chun1">[29]</xref>. Similarly to findings reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Choudhary2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Denton1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Marsden1">[18]</xref>, we observed a clear increase of HIV transcripts when splenic tissue from HIV infected mice with suppressed HIV RNA was stimulated. These findings are promising for using hu mice for studying the latent reservoir and in particular for studying approaches to eradicate it. We observed no correlation between cellular HIV-associated proviral DNA and engraftment level or peak viremia. These data show that hu mice represent a model to study latency and potentially novel treatment strategies. Viral rebound or its absence <italic>in vivo</italic> will be a definitive end point of novel eradication strategies aiming to cure HIV infection.</p>
      <p>We also report the use of our HIV hu mouse model in the study of TMC278 and TMC181 in a galenic formulation that results in plasma levels above the C<sub>target</sub> for at least 1 week after administration (long-acting drugs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Baert1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-vantKlooster1">[31]</xref>. TMC278 corresponds to the recently approved NNRTI, rilpivirine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Miller1">[32]</xref>. Note that TMC181-LA is a prototype HIV long-acting protease inhibitor; however, the compound is not itself a candidate for clinical development. We tested TMC278-LA as adjunct to the backbone of 3TC and TDF for treating disseminated HIV infection and TMC278-LA alone or in combination with TMC181-LA for maintenance therapy in mice with suppressed HIV RNA. As expected, TMC278-LA was very potent in combination with the NRTI backbone (see above). However, TMC278-LA as monotherapy was not sufficient to maintain HIV suppression. Indeed, all mice showed a viral breakthrough. This prompt viral breakthrough is consistent with the clinical experience in humans: the NNRTI class must be given with a potent backbone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Camacho1">[33]</xref>. Indeed, due to the long half-life of efavirenz (EFV) and nevirapine (NVP), as opposed to other anti-HIV drugs, interruption of ART containing either EFV or NVP at once results in a monotherapy with the risk of the emergence of NNRTI-resistant strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Taylor1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Fox1">[35]</xref>. This clinical observation documents the relatively low genetic barrier of NNRTIs when given alone. In contrast, TMC278-LA in concert with TMC181-LA was highly efficient with a response rate close to 100% over time. In fact, clinical trials are under way to examine simplification of ART (e.g., combination of the protease inhibitor atazanavir and the integrase inhibitor raltegravir) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Cordery1">[36]</xref>. Thus, this HIV mouse model would be superbly suited for a pre-clinical proof-of-concept of novel ART strategies (e.g., nucleoside sparing regimens, long-acting drugs).</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>In summary, we present data of ART responses/failures in larger number of mice that eventually position this hu mouse model as key tool in the evaluation of novel treatment strategies and latency. Hu mice, indeed, recapitulate central steps in HIV infection, including high-titer viral dissemination, response to ART, viral failure in the case of non-adherence and very importantly viral rebound after ART interruption. Viral rebound after interruption of ART points clearly to a latent reservoir of HIV. This model will be crucial when testing compounds for activating the latent reservoir aiming to eradicate and eventually cure HIV. We underscore this statement by documenting the value of long-acting anti-HIV drugs for suppressing HIV that might be very effective in certain clinical situations, e.g., PREP, PEP or in patients with poor adherence, as a simplified maintenance regimen, or in patients unable to swallow drugs.</p>

        <title>Reverse transcription</title>
        <p>RNA was DNase treated using DNA-free kit (Ambion). For reverse transcription random hexamer primers (Operon Technologies) and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) were used. Reverse transcription was performed as described earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038853-Manrique1">[40]</xref>; briefly cDNA synthesis was performed using 10 ¬µl DNase treated RNA in the presence of Ribolock Rnase inhibitor (Fermentas) in a total volume of 50 ¬µl as follows: 60 min at 50¬∞C, 60 min at 55¬∞, 15 min at 70¬∞C and then 1 min on ice. Subsequently 1 ¬µl of RNAseH (NEB) was added to each tube and incubated at 37¬∞C for 20 min. Aliquots were stored at ‚àí20¬∞C or used immediately for real-time PCR analysis.</p>
