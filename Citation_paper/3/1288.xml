<abstract>
<p>Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are paroxysmal behaviors that resemble epileptic seizures but lack abnormal electrical activity. Recent studies suggest aberrant functional connectivity involving specific brain regions in PNES. Little is known, however, about alterations of topological organization of whole-brain functional and structural connectivity networks in PNES. We constructed functional connectivity networks from resting-state functional MRI signal correlations and structural connectivity networks from diffusion tensor imaging tractography in 17 PNES patients and 20 healthy controls. Graph theoretical analysis was employed to compute network properties. Moreover, we investigated the relationship between functional and structural connectivity networks. We found that PNES patients exhibited altered small-worldness in both functional and structural networks and shifted towards a more regular (lattice-like) organization, which could serve as a potential imaging biomarker for PNES. In addition, many regional characteristics were altered in structural connectivity network, involving attention, sensorimotor, subcortical and default-mode networks. These regions with altered nodal characteristics likely reflect disease-specific pathophysiology in PNES. Importantly, the coupling strength of functional-structural connectivity was decreased and exhibited high sensitivity and specificity to differentiate PNES patients from healthy controls, suggesting that the decoupling strength of functional-structural connectivity might be an important characteristic reflecting the mechanisms of PNES. This is the first study to explore the altered topological organization in PNES combining functional and structural connectivity networks, providing a new way to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of PNES.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are paroxysmal behaviors, such as involuntary movement, sensation, or experience, which resemble epileptic seizures, but are not accompanied by abnormal electrical activity in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Devinsky1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Baslet1">[2]</xref>. PNES occur often in the general population, with an estimated prevalence of 2-33/100,000 persons per years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Benbadis1">[3]</xref>. The patients with PNES are frequently misdiagnosed and treated for epilepsy, which is detrimental because of the side effects of antiepileptic drugs and the delay in proper treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Leis1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Reuber1">[5]</xref>. Etiologically, dissociative or conversion disorder is an important manifestation of PNES <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Brown1">[6]</xref>. Although aetiology facilitated the pathophysiology of PNES, the condition is still mysterious, and only a few lines of evidence from multiple modalities have specifically indicated underlying distributed cortical abnormalities. Specifically, an EEG synchronization study revealed decreased prefrontal and parietal synchronization in PNES, reflecting dysfunction of fronto-parietal networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Knyazeva1">[7]</xref>. More recently, a resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) study implied increased functional connectivity between emotional, executive control and sensorimotor networks in PNES <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-vanderKruijs1">[8]</xref>. Together, these studies point to an aberrant functional connectivity in specific brain networks. Little is known, yet, about changes in whole-brain large-scale functional and structural connectivity network in patients with PNES.</p>
<p>Analysis of functional connectivity networks can be conducted via temporal correlation between neural or blood oxygen level-dependent functional MRI signals arising from distinct brain regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Salvador1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Achard1">[10]</xref>, thus leading to a network perspective on brain dynamics. Structural connectivity networks, on the other hand, mainly based on white matter tracts quantified by diffusion tractography <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Hagmann1">[11]</xref>, give insights into microstructural white matter architecture. A network-level assessment of brain function and structure provides a useful and new framework to examine complex network properties of the intact and the diseased brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Guye1">[12]</xref>. Recently, both functional and structural connectivity networks have been found exhibiting small-world architecture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Achard1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Hagmann1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Ding1">[13]</xref>, allowing global and local parallel information processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Bassett1">[14]</xref>. Small-world network reflects two fundamental principles in human brain: functional segregation and integration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Sporns1">[15]</xref>. Functional and structural connectivity networks are complementary. Structural connectivity network, at least to some extent, is the physical substrate of functional connectivity network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Greicius1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-vandenHeuvel1">[17]</xref>. Overall, findings have demonstrated that structural connections are highly predictive of and place constraints on functional interactions across the human brain network over various spatial scales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Greicius1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Honey1">[18]</xref>. Conversely, functional connections exert effects on structural connections through mechanisms of plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Hagmann2">[19]</xref>. Evaluating the relationship (coupling) between functional and structural connectivity has got more and more attention, which should greatly enhance our understanding of normal and abnormal mechanism of brain networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Greicius1">[16]</xref>. Recent studies have found that the coupling of functional-structural connectivity strengthens with age during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Hagmann2">[19]</xref>, and becomes disrupted in disease states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Skudlarski1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Zhang1">[21]</xref>. Accordingly, the coupling of functional-structural connectivity may allow for a more sensitive detection of subtle brain pathophysiological abnormalities than any single modality.</p>
<p>The study of large-scale functional and structural brain networks employing tools and measures of graph theory has proven to be particularly appealing for clinical neuroscience, especially for epilepsy, a disorder of cortical network organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Kramer1">[22]</xref>. Commonly, fMRI studies have suggested altered small-world topology and a shift towards more random topology in both partial and generalized epilepsy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Zhang1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Liao1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Vlooswijk1">[24]</xref>. In this work, we will examine whether the same topological aberrances of functional connectivity network and structural connectivity network can be seen in PNES. If not, we want to determine what specific network topological organization could be used as a potential biomarker to distinguish PNES from epileptic seizures. Furthermore, as functional connectivity network and structural connectivity network are intimately related and share common small-world topological feature, we predict that the pathological state of PNES may alter this relationship, providing new insights into pathophysiological mechanism underlying PNES.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Twenty patients with PNES (7 males, mean age: 19.65±7.56 years) and 20 healthy volunteers (8 males, mean age: 21.85±1.70 years) were recruited from Department of Neurology, West China Hospital, Chengdu, China. PNES patients were given definitive diagnoses by experienced neurologists using clinical descriptions of symptoms and long-term video/EEG monitoring, which is consistent with recent recommendations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Devinsky1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Benbadis2">[25]</xref>. The inclusion criteria included: 1) at least one single typical episode was recorded by video EEG, and EEG did not show any epileptiform discharge or ictal slowing; 2) patients have no history of neurological disease; 3) patients have no obvious abnormality in routine structural MRI examinations. The exclusion criteria included: 1) patients with neurological comorbidity (e.g. epilepsy); 2) patients with malingering, or any psychiatric disorders (e.g. mood and anxiety disorders, schizophrenia and psychosis). Only patients with a diagnosis of definite PNES were included in the study. Four of 20 patients were taking antiepileptic drugs before the diagnosis of PNES. All drugs were discontinued at least two weeks prior to MRI examination. Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of PNES can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0063850.s003">Table S1</xref>. To ensure all patients’ illness condition as similar as possible, two patients with very long duration of disease (about 18 years) were excluded in this study. The healthy subjects did not have any neurologic or psychiatric disorders, and take any psychotropic medication within the past six months. This study was approved by local Ethics Committee of West China Hospital. Before experimentation, written informed consent was obtained from each subject and for the minors/children participants, parents signed their written informed consent.</p>

<title>Data Acquisition</title>
<p>All subjects underwent structural, functional and diffusion tensor imaging scanning on a 3T Siemens Trio system (Erlangen, Germany). During data acquisition, subjects were instructed to relax with their eyes closed, and to keep their heads still. Foam padding and earplugs were used to reduce head motion and scanner noise. Functional images were acquired using a single-shot, gradient-recalled echo planar imaging sequence for a total of 205 volumes (repetition time [TR]/echo time [TE] = 2000/30 ms; flip angle = 90; field of view = 240×240 mm<sup>2</sup>; in-plane matrix = 64×64; voxel size = 3.75×3.75×5 mm<sup>3</sup>, no slice gap; 30 axial slices). The diffusion tensor images covering the whole brain were collected using a single-shot spin-echo planar imaging sequence, including 20 volumes with diffusion gradients applied along 20 non-collinear directions (b = 1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>) and one volume without diffusion weighting (b = 0 s/mm<sup>2</sup>). Each volume consisted of 50 contiguous axial slices (TR/TE = 6800/93 ms; flip angle = 90°; field of view = 240×240 mm2; in-plane matrix = 128×128; voxel size = 1.88×1.88×3 mm3, no slice gap). Additionally, high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical images were also acquired using a magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence (TR/TE = 20/3.69 ms; flip angle = 12; field of view = 250×250 mm<sup>2</sup>; in-plane matrix = 320×320; voxel size = 0.78×0.78×1 mm<sup>3</sup>, no slice gap, 128 sagittal slices) for each subject. Data from one patient was discarder due to uncompleted diffusion tensor images, resulting in a final analysis of 17 PNES patients and 20 healthy controls.</p>

<p>The coupling analysis was constrained by the edges with non-zero structural connectivity, similar to our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Zhang1">[21]</xref>.

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>We first computed global topological properties (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0063850.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0063850.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0063850.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0063850.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) of both weighted and binarized functional and structural connectivity networks for each subject on a range of cost thresholds (0.18≤cost≤0.39). We also calculated the area under the curve (AUC) for global topological properties, which provides a summarized scalar for brain topological properties independent of single threshold selection. Then, a nonparametric permutation test method was performed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-vandenHeuvel2">[27]</xref> to detect the significant group differences in global topological properties. A significance threshold of <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 (FDR-corrected) was used for testing global topological properties, except AUC of each global topological property for which an uncorrected threshold of <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01 was used since no multiple comparisons were performed. Of note, before the permutation tests, age and gender for each network properties were regressed out as covariates by multiple linear regression analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0063850.s006">Text S1</xref>).</p>
<p>To detect differences of regional properties, the same permutation framework was performed on the AUC of each regional property (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0063850.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0063850.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0063850.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). A significance threshold of <italic>p</italic> = 0.01 (uncorrected) was used. To address the problem of multiple comparisons, we set the significance threshold level at <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, Bonferroni-corrected for the number of brain regions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the coupling of functional-structural connectivity was compared by using permutation tests. Testing was performed on the difference of functional-structural connectivity coupling strength.</p>

<title>Global Topology of Functional and Structural Connectivity Networks</title>
<p>Both PNES patients and healthy controls showed a small-world organization (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0063850.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) in functional and structural connectivity networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063850-g001">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0063850.s001">Fig. S1</xref>).

To eliminate the effect of threshold selection, we further compared the integrated AUC of each global network topology and found that the patterns of topological alterations in PNES patients were similar for both functional and structural connectivity networks: decreased network connectivity strength <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0063850.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, increased normalized weighted clustering coefficient <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0063850.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, normalized weighted characteristic path length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0063850.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the small-worldness <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0063850.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, uncorrected) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063850-g002">Fig. 2</xref>).

<title>Altered Coupling Strength of Functional-structural Connectivity</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This is the first study to investigate disruptions of network topology and network coupling between functional and structural connectivity networks using graph theoretical analysis in PNES patients. The results revealed that PNES patients had altered small-worldness in both functional and structural connectivity networks, indicating a more regular (lattice-like) organization in large-scale brain networks. Additionally, many regional characteristics were altered in structural connectivity networks, involving attention, sensorimotor, subcortical and default-mode networks. Most importantly, we found that the coupling strength of functional-structural connectivity was significantly decreased and exhibited high sensitivity and specificity to differentiate PNES patients from healthy controls. These results may provide new insights into our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of PNES.</p>

<title>Altered Global Topology of Functional and Structural Connectivity Networks</title>
<p>The human brain is a large, interacting, complex network with a pronounced small-world topology, which is characterized by high local clustering between neighboring nodes but with short path lengths between any pair of nodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Bassett1">[14]</xref>. Small-world topology has been found in both functional and structural networks at either the whole brain or RSNs level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Achard1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Hagmann1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Ding1">[13]</xref>, which might reflect a fundamental organization principle in the human brain networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Bullmore1">[30]</xref>. Consistently, our study found that both PNES patients and healthy controls showed small-world topology in functional and structural connectivity networks.</p>
<p>However, compared to healthy controls, PNES patients showed altered topological patterns: increased normalized weighted clustering coefficient <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0063850.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and normalized weighted characteristic path length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0063850.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which were similar in functional and structural connectivity networks. Since that the small-world topology reflects an optimal balance between fragmentation and coalescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Bassett1">[14]</xref>, our results therefore indicate a disturbance of the normal balance in functional and structural connectivity networks in PNES patients. Moreover, the findings of increased local specialization (larger <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0063850.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and decreased global integration (larger <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0063850.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) in PNES patients suggest a more regular (lattice-like) organization in large-scale functional and structural connectivity networks. Regular networks have lower ability of global integration and less efficient information propagation compared with small-world networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Latora1">[31]</xref>. Thus, the loss of small-worldness in PNES patients indicates a less optimal topological organization in functional and structural connectivity networks. Currently, there is a high risk to misdiagnose PNES as epilepsy, which not only has serious consequences for the patients because of unnecessary anticonvulsant medication and the delay of treatment, but also has a substantial economic burden for the expensive treatments of intractable epilepsy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Leis1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Reuber1">[5]</xref>. It is important to distinguish between PNES and epilepsy. Previous fMRI studies of epilepsy have suggested a shift towards more randomness brain architecture in both partial and generalized epilepsy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Zhang1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Liao1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Vlooswijk1">[24]</xref>. In the present study, however, we found a more regular organization of functional and structural connectivity networks in PNES patients, reflecting a different pathogenic mechanism between PNES and epilepsy. This finding might provide a new neuroimaging marker to aid in the diagnosis of PNES.</p>
<p>In addition, we found that the network connectivity strength <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0063850.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was decreased in both functional and structural connectivity networks in PNES patients. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0063850.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> measures the global connectivity strength in the brain networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Hagmann1">[11]</xref>. The decreased connectivity strength might also suggest ineffective global information processing in PNES patients, since the loss of integration of emotion, executive control and motor function has been found in PNES <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-vanderKruijs1">[8]</xref>.</p>

<title>Altered Regional Topology of Functional and Structural Connectivity Networks</title>
<p>In the present study, we investigated the altered nodal characteristics in PNES patients using regional connectivity strength <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0063850.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, efficiency <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0063850.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and betweenness centrality <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0063850.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. These nodal characteristics can reflect the roles of nodes in information transport and integration across the network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Hagmann1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Rubinov1">[28]</xref>. For example, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0063850.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> provides information on the total degree of connectivity; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0063850.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0063850.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> can both quantify the importance of the nodes for the communication within the network. In structural connectivity network, we found that regions with decreased characteristics in PNES patients were mainly involved in attention, sensorimotor and default-mode networks, and increased regional characteristics were mainly in subcortical systems and some other regions.</p>
<p>We observed decreased nodal characteristics in some regions related to attention system (INS, MFG, ORBinf and IFGoperc). The insula is an important multisensory integration area and mediate interpretation of sensory information from the body, which is involved with emotion regulation, visceral sensory perception and self-awareness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Craig1">[32]</xref>. The insula and opercular part of frontal gyrus are important regions of attention systems, involving in the coordination and evaluation of task performance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Eckert1">[33]</xref>. The middle frontal gyrus and orbital part of frontal gyrus were associated with working memory and emotion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Gleichgerrcht1">[34]</xref>. Thus, the decreased nodal characteristics of these regions may support that PNES patients are associated with the damage of attentive and emotional function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-vanderKruijs1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>Decreased nodal characteristics were also found in some regions (SMG, ROL and STG) belonging to sensorimotor network. Sensorimotor network is implicated in self-initiated action as well as in unconscious motor inhibition. PNES are episodes of altered movement and sensation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Brown1">[6]</xref>. Recently, Labate et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Labate1">[35]</xref> investigated structural brain correlates of PNES patients by combining voxel-based morphometry and cortical thickness, and found abnormal cortical atrophy of motor regions. Using resting-state fMRI technique, another study showed that abnormal functional connectivity of PNES was involved in sensorimotor cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-vanderKruijs1">[8]</xref>. Combining these findings, our results indicate that sensorimotor network play an important role in the pathogenesis of PNES patients.</p>
<p>In addition, some regions (PHG, MTG, SFGdor and TPOsup) also showed decreased nodal characteristics, which are parts of default-mode networks. Previous studies have found that damage of DMN was associated with a reduced cognitive performance in other brain diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Roosendaal1">[36]</xref>. Our findings support that PNES are characterized by cognitive dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Knyazeva1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Labate1">[35]</xref>.</p>
<p>Regions with increased <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0063850.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> were mainly related to subcortical regions (AMYG, CAU, PUT and HIP). Subcortical regions play an important role in the overall modulation and regulation of emotions and cognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Feil1">[37]</xref>. Damage to subcortical regions will result in a range of impaired behaviors, such as executive dysfunction, memory retrieval deficit and emotional incontinence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Feil1">[37]</xref>, which are consistent with the clinical manifestations of PNES patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Brown1">[6]</xref>. Considering the decreased nodal characteristics in attention, sensorimotor and default-mode networks, the increased <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0063850.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in subcortical regions might indicate a complementary mechanism in PNES.</p>
<p>Taking together, these regions with altered nodal properties suggest dysfunction of emotion, cognitive and motor, supporting the fact that PNES is often accompanied by many diffuse psychological, psychiatric and somatoform symptoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Baslet1">[2]</xref>. These regional differences likely reflect disease-specific pathophysiology in PNES.</p>
<p>In the present study, we found no significant differences of nodal characteristics in both weighted and binarized functional connectivity network. This finding is not surprising, since the global network properties in functional connectivity network showed only subtle alterations compared to those of structural connectivity networks. We speculate that the statistically insignificant nodal properties might contribute to these subtle alterations of global measures in functional connectivity network. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the limited sample size reduced the test power to detect differences of regional characteristics in functional connectivity network in PNES patients.</p>

<title>Decoupling between Functional and Structural Connectivity Networks</title>
<p>The present study investigated the function-structure relations in large-scale brain networks in PNES patients and healthy controls. Functional network represents temporal coherence of brain regions, and structural network measures anatomical integrity of white matter tracts, the material backbone for communication between brain regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Catani1">[38]</xref>. Structural connections, when present, are highly predictive of, and place constraints on, functional connections. Conversely, functional connections exert effects on structural connections through mechanisms of plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Hagmann2">[19]</xref>. However, structural connections cannot reliably be inferred on the observed functional connections, since strong functional connections with absent structural connections still exist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Honey2">[39]</xref>. Perhaps polysynaptic structural connections (in the absence of direct structural connections) enable such functional connections, which results in a complex relationship between functional and structural connectivity. In the present study, we only investigated the function-structure relations on the direct (non-zero) structural connections. Recent studies have found that the function-structure relations can be reconfigured under physiological <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Honey1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Hagmann2">[19]</xref>, or pathological states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Skudlarski1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Zhang1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>As we predicted, the coupling of functional-structural connectivity was decreased in PNES patients. This finding suggests loss of coalescence of functional and structural connectomes, reflecting abnormal mechanism of brain networks in PNES patients. Specifically, while taking coupling strength as an index, we could differentiate PNES patients from healthy controls (with a high specificity of 75% and a high sensitivity of 77%). This finding has potential implications for improving the diagnosis and evaluating the treatment of PNES. However, it is difficult to unravel the causality between disrupted functional and structural connectivity networks, which needs to be further examined in future work.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4d">
<title>Study Limitations</title>
<p>Several limitations of the current study should be mentioned. First, the number of patients was relatively small. However, even in this small population, statistically significant alterations in connectivity were found. Second, functional and structural connectivity networks were constructed at a regional level with 90 regions from the AAL atlas. Brain networks with different parcellation schemes or at different spatial scales show distinct network topological organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Zalesky1">[40]</xref>. Thus, further studies are needed to determine which parcellation strategy or spatial scale is more appropriate to investigate the network mechanism of PNES. Finally, structural connectivity networks were constructed using deterministic tractography, similar to other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Zhang1">[21]</xref>. This may reduce the sensitivity, since the tracking procedure stops when it reaches regions with fibre crossings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Mori1">[41]</xref>. In future study, probabilistic tractography techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063850-Gong1">[42]</xref> should be considered to address this issue.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, we for the first time combined functional and structural connectivity networks to investigate the topological organization of large-scale brain network in patients of PNES. PNES patients lost optimal topological organization in functional and structural connectivity networks reflected by a shift towards more regular brain architecture, which could serve as a potential imaging biomarker for PNES patients. Additionally, structural connectivity networks exhibited altered nodal characteristics in some key regions associated with attention, sensorimotor, subcortical and default-mode systems in PNES. Importantly, we found decreased coupling strength of functional-structural connectivity in PNES, and the coupling showed high sensitivity and specificity to differentiate PNES patients from healthy controls, suggesting that the decoupling strength of functional-structural connectivity might be an important characteristic reflecting the mechanisms of PNES. Our analysis provides a new way to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of PNES.</p>
