<abstract>
<p>Development of cardiac dysfunction is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with sepsis. Increasing evidence shows that gender determines the degree of inflammatory response of the host and that females tolerate sepsis better than males. It is unknown whether gender affects the cardiac dysfunction in animals or patients with sepsis. To investigate this, male or female C57BL/6 mice were subjected to either lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/peptidoglycan (PepG) co-administration or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). At 18 hours after LPS/PepG injection or 24 hours after CLP, cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography. The septic insult caused a significant cardiac dysfunction in both genders. However, the cardiac dysfunction was significantly less pronounced in females in comparison with males subjected to LPS (3 mg/kg)/PepG (0.1 mg/kg) or CLP. Compared with males injected with LPS (3 mg/kg)/PepG (0.1 mg/kg), western blotting analysis of the myocardium from females injected with LPS/PepG revealed i) profound increases in phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS; ii) significant decreases in phosphorylation of IκBα, nuclear translocation of the NF-κB subunit p65, decreased expression of iNOS and decreased synthesis of TNF-α and IL-6 in the heart. However, the gender dimorphism of the cardiac dysfunction secondary to LPS/PepG was not observed when higher doses of LPS (9 mg/kg)/PepG (1 mg/kg) were used. In conclusion, the cardiac dysfunction caused by sepsis was less pronounced in female than in male mice. The protection of female hearts against the dysfunction associated with sepsis is (at least in part) attributable to cardiac activation of the Akt/eNOS survival pathway, decreased activation of NF-κB, and decreased expression of iNOS, TNF-α and IL-6. It should be noted that the observed gender dimorphism of the cardiac dysfunction in sepsis was not seen when a very severe stimulus (high dose of LPS/PepG co-administration) was used to cause cardiac dysfunction.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sepsis is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality among admissions to the intensive care unit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Angus1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Padkin1">[2]</xref>. Sepsis is a systemic dysregulated hyperinflammatory and/or anti-inflammatory response to infectious stimuli, such as bacteria, viruses and fungi, which, when excessive, may progress to organ failure and death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Hotchkiss1">[3]</xref>. Development of myocardial dysfunction is associated with increased morbidity and mortality of sepsis. More than 40% cases of sepsis have cardiovascular impairment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Fernandes1">[4]</xref> and the presence of myocardial dysfunction can increase the mortality rate of affected patients to 70% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Blanco1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>There is now good evidence that gender is a key determinant in the degree of the host inflammatory response and even of outcome in patients with sepsis. In a number of clinical and epidemiological studies, a significantly increased survival rate was reported in female patients when compared with male patients with sepsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Bone1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Schroder1">[9]</xref>. This may be associated with lower pro-inflammatory and higher anti-inflammatory cytokine levels in female patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Schroder1">[9]</xref>. Moreover, healthy female volunteers challenged with either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or lipoteichoic acid (LTA) showed less pro-inflammatory response than males as demonstrated by lower levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and IL-8 in blood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Aulock1">[10]</xref>. In addition, severely injured male trauma-patients had a higher incidence of sepsis, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and greater elevations in plasma procalcitonin and IL-6 compared with the equivalent group of females <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Oberholzer1">[11]</xref>. Further basic research studies also confirmed these clinical data on gender dimorphism following sepsis. These experimental studies suggested that females had immunologic advantage and showed a significantly increased survival rate compared with males following induction of polymicrobial sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Zellweger1">[12]</xref>. In addition, estrogen treatment attenuated the liver dysfunction and intestine injury caused by sepsis in rats with decreased serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and ameliorated oxidative organ damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Sener1">[13]</xref>, while testosterone receptor blockade with flutamide following trauma-hemorrhage restored immune depression and significantly decreased the mortality after a subsequent septic challenge in male animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Angele1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>However, little is known about the impact of gender dimorphism on cardiac dysfunction caused by sepsis. Moreover, the mechanisms underlying the gender difference in susceptibility of the heart to a septic challenge are not understood. The present study was designed to determine whether the severity of myocardial dysfunction caused by either co-administration of LPS/peptidoglycan (PepG) or polymicrobial sepsis induced by CLP differs in male and female mice. Having found that the cardiac dysfunction associated with sepsis was less pronounced in female than in male mice, we have then investigated the potential signalling pathways that may have contributed to the observed differences.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>The animal protocols followed in this study were approved by the Animal Welfare Ethics Review Board (AWERB) of Queen Mary University of London in accordance with the derivatives of both the Home Office guidance on the Operation of Animals (Scientific Procedures Act 1986) published by Her Majesty’s Stationery Office and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Research Council. All surgery was performed under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia and echocardiography was performed under inhalation anesthesia of isoflurane, buprenorphine was administered before surgery as well as 6 hours and 18 hours after surgery to reduce postoperative pain, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering of the animals. This study was carried out on ten week-old male (n = 29) and age-matched female (n = 22) C57BL/6 mice, weighing 20–30 g, and eight month-old male (n = 12) and age-matched female (n = 12) C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories UK Ltd., Kent, UK), weighing 35–50 g. The animals were allowed to acclimatize to laboratory conditions for a period of at least one week before any experimental procedures were initiated. They were housed in individually ventilated cages lined with an absorbent bedding material with no more than 6 mice per cage. The room temperature and humidity was maintained at 19°C–23°C and 55%, respectively. All animals had free access to a standard diet and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. The feeding boxes were cleaned and disinfected every 3 days, and the water was changed on a daily basis to prevent infectious diseases. Animals were inspected for signs of illness and/or unusual behaviour by research staff at least once per day. All studies involving animals are reported in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines for reporting experiments involving animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Kilkenny1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-McGrath1">[16]</xref>.</p>

<title>Model of LPS/PepG-induced Cardiac Dysfunction</title>
<p>Ten week-old male and female C57BL/6 mice received intraperitoneal administration of LPS/PepG (LPS; 3 mg/kg and PepG; 0.1 mg/kg or LPS; 9 mg/kg and PepG; 1 mg/kg in PBS; 5 ml/kg i.p.). Sham-treated mice were not subjected to LPS/PepG, but were otherwise treated the same way. Eighteen hours after LPS/PepG administration, cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography <italic>in vivo</italic>. Mice were then deeply anesthetized i.p. with ketamine/xylazine, and were killed by removing the hearts. Heart samples were stored at −80°C for further analyses. Mice were randomly allocated into eight different groups. The following groups were studied for the low dose LPS/PepG co-administration [LPS (3 mg/kg)/PepG (0.1 mg/kg)] study: (i) Male+vehicle (n = 6); (ii) Female+vehicle (n = 4); (iii) Male+LPS/PepG (n = 7); (iv) Female+LPS/PepG (n = 8). The following groups were studied for the high dose LPS/PepG co-administration [LPS (9 mg/kg)/PepG (1 mg/kg)] study: (i) Male+vehicle (n = 5); (ii) Female+vehicle (n = 4); (iii) Male+LPS/PepG (n = 11); (iv) Female+LPS/PepG (n = 6).</p>

<title>Model of Polymicrobial Sepsis caused by Cecal Ligation and Puncture</title>
<p>Eight month-old male and female C57BL/6 mice were subjected to CLP. Sham-operated mice were not subjected to ligation or perforation of cecum but were otherwise treated the same way. We followed the original CLP protocol introduced by Wichterman and co-workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Wichterman1">[17]</xref> with slight modifications including analgesia, antibiotic therapy and fluid resuscitation as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Coldewey1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Khan1">[19]</xref>. Based on previous evidence and preliminary data, an 18-G needle was used with the double puncture technique in order to generate reproducible cardiac dysfunction during the early phase of sepsis (24 hours). Briefly, mice were anesthetized i.p. with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) prepared in the same solution by using 1.5 ml/kg. Buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg i.p.) was injected additionally to provide adequate analgesia. The rectal temperature of the animals was maintained at 37°C with a homeothermic blanket. The abdomen was opened via a 1.5 cm midline incision, and the cecum exposed. The cecum was ligated just below the ileocecal valve and punctured at both opposite ends. After a small amount of fecal matter was extruded from both ends, the cecum was placed back in its anatomical position and the abdomen was sutured. Ringer’s solution was given s.c. for resuscitation directly after surgery (1 ml/mouse) and 6 hours and 18 hours after surgery (0.5 ml/mouse). Antibiotic (Imipenem/Cilastin; 20 mg/kg s.c.) and analgesia (buprenorphine; 0.05 mg/kg i.p.) was administered 6 hours and 18 hours after surgery. At 24 hours after CLP, cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography <italic>in vivo</italic>. Mice were then deeply anesthetized i.p. with ketamine/xylazine, and were killed by removing the hearts. Heart samples were stored at −80°C for further analyses.

<title>Assessment of Cardiac Function <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Cardiac function was assessed in mice by echocardiography <italic>in vivo</italic> as reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Coldewey1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Khan1">[19]</xref>. At 18 hours after LPS/PepG co-administration or 24 hours after CLP, anesthesia was induced with 3% isoflurane and maintained at 0.5 to 0.7% for the duration of the procedure. Before assessment of cardiac function, mice were allowed to stabilize for at least 10 minutes. During echocardiography the heart rate was obtained from ECG tracing and the temperature was monitored with a rectal thermometer. Two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiography images were recorded using a Vevo-770 imaging system (VisualSonics, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Percentage fractional area change (FAC) was assessed from a two-dimensional trace and percentage EF and fractional shortening (FS) were calculated from the M-mode measurements in the parasternal short axis view at the level of the papillary muscles.</p>

<title>Western Blot Analysis</title>
<p>Semi-quantitative western blot analyses were carried out in mouse heart tissues as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Collino1">[20]</xref>. We assessed the degree of phosphorylation of Akt on Ser<sup>473</sup>, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) on Ser<sup>1177</sup>, inhibitor of κB (IκB) α on Ser<sup>32/36</sup>, as well as the nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of nuclear factor (NF)-κB (nucleus/cytosol ratio) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression. Briefly, mouse heart samples were homogenized in 10% homogenization buffer and centrifuged at 4000 RPM for 5 minutes at 4°C. Supernatants were removed and centrifuged at 14 000 RPM at 4°C for 40 minutes to obtain the cytosolic fraction. The pelleted nuclei were re-suspended in extraction buffer and centrifuged at 14 000 RPM for 20 minutes at 4°C. The resulting supernatants containing nuclear proteins were carefully removed, and protein content was determined on both nuclear and cytosolic extracts using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay following the manufacturer’s directions (Therma Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL). Proteins were separated by 8% sodium dodecyl sulphatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to a polyvinyldenedifluoride (PVDF) membrane, which was then incubated with a primary antibody (rabbit anti-total Akt, dilution 1:1000; mouse anti-pAkt Ser<sup>473</sup>, dilution 1:1000; rabbit anti-total eNOS, dilution 1:200; goat anti-peNOS Ser<sup>1177</sup>, dilution 1:200; mouse anti-total IκBα, dilution 1:1000; mouse anti-IκBα pSer<sup>32/36</sup>, dilution 1:1000; rabbit anti-NF-κΒ p65, dilution 1:1000; rabbit anti-total iNOS, dilution 1:200). Blots were then incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (dilution 1:10000) for 30 minutes at room temperature and developed with the ECL detection system. The immunoreactive bands were visualized by autoradiography. Densitometric analysis of the bands was performed using the Gel Pro Analyzer 4.5, 2000 software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA). Each group was then adjusted against corresponding sham data to establish relative protein expression when compared with sham animals.</p>

<title>Gender Dimorphism of Cardiac Dysfunction in Response to LPS (3 mg/kg)/PepG (0.1 mg/kg) Co-administration</title>

<title>Gender Dimorphism of Cardiac Dysfunction in Response to CLP-induced Polymicrobial Sepsis</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We describe here for the first time that the myocardial dysfunction caused by LPS/PepG is less pronounced in female than in male mice <italic>in vivo</italic>. This finding is in agreement with the previous reports showing that the cardiac dysfunction caused by myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Wang1">[21]</xref>, trauma-hemorrhage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Szalay1">[22]</xref> and burns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Horton1">[23]</xref> is also less pronounced in females than in males. Estrogen modulates a number of acute injury-related myocardial responses; specifically estrogen protects the heart against the injury and dysfunction caused by trauma-hemorrhage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Hsu1">[24]</xref> and ischemia/reperfusion injury (in isolated hearts subjected to global ischemia and in hearts undergoing LAD occlusion <italic>in vivo</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Kim1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Kolodgie1">[26]</xref>. Although we provide clear evidence that female hearts show less dysfunction than male murine hearts when challenged with LPS/PepG, we wished to confirm this finding by using a more clinically relevant model of polymicrobial sepsis with antibiotic therapy and fluid-resuscitation caused by CLP in middle-aged mice (8 month-old) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Coldewey1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Khan1">[19]</xref>. The age of mice was selected based on the knowledge that 8 month-old female C57BL/6 mice are pre-ovarian failure and still have an active estrus cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Nelson1">[27]</xref>. Most notably, we demonstrate here that the cardiac function in female mice subjected to polymicrobial sepsis induced by CLP was significantly less pronounced than the cardiac dysfunction observed in male mice. Taken together, these findings indicate that the hearts of young or older female mice exhibit less cardiac dysfunction in response to polymicrobial sepsis or co-administration of LPS/PepG.</p>
<p>To obtain a better insight into the mechanisms underlying the observed gender dimorphism of the cardiac response to sepsis, we investigated the phosphorylation of Akt, eNOS and IκBα, nuclear translocation of NF-κB subunit p65, iNOS expression, as well as TNF-α and IL-6 expression in murine hearts; When compared to the hearts of male mice subjected to LPS/PepG, hearts of female mice subjected to LPS/PepG showed i) profound increases in phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS; ii) reductions in phosphorylation of IκBα and nuclear translocation of the NF-κB subunit p65, iii) reduced expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6, and iv) reduced expression of iNOS.</p>
<p>Akt is a member of the phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) signal transduction enzyme family, activation of which protects the heart against injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Rajesh1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Yu1">[29]</xref>. Here we demonstrate that co-administration of LPS/PepG to female rather than male mice leads to a greater increase in Akt-phosphorylation and, hence, activity in the heart of female animals. Indeed, a greater increase in cardiac Akt phosphorylation in female when compared to male hearts also accounts for the reduced cardiac injury caused by ischemia-reperfusion in female mice. Most notably, when the Akt-pathway is blocked, the degree of cardiac injury in male and female mice was identical. Thus, activation of cardiac Akt (presumably by estradiol) protects female hearts against cardiac injury and dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Bae1">[30]</xref>. Estradiol activates cardiac Akt, which in turn also leads to a reduction in the cardiac dysfunction caused by trauma-hemorrhage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Hsu1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Yu1">[29]</xref>. Blockade of the Akt pathway also abrogated the salutary effects of estradiol on cardiac function following trauma-hemorrhage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Hsu1">[24]</xref>. Moreover, activation of Akt mediates the inhibition by estradiol of the TNF-α expression and NF-κB activation caused by LPS in cardiomyocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Liu1">[31]</xref>. In the present study, we found a small increase in cardiac Akt activity in female than in male sham hearts. In line with this finding, one previous study showed that young women possess higher levels of Akt in the myocardium compared to comparably aged men or postmenopausal women, and that sexually mature female mice have elevated Akt kinase activity in nuclear extracts of hearts than male mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-CamperKirby1">[32]</xref>. The hypothesis that cardiac Akt activity is modulated by estrogen is also supported by the finding that the Akt activation in cardiomyocytes was reduced in ovariectomized rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Ren1">[33]</xref>. In addition, activation of the PI3K/Akt signalling cascade by estrogen was observed in rat cardiomyocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Yu1">[29]</xref>. A few studies have been conducted to explain the exact mechanism by which estrogen induces Akt activation. Estrogen receptor α has been shown to bind with the p85 α regulatory subunit of PI3K in a ligand-dependent manner in human endothelial cells; increased estrogen receptor associated PI3K activity induced by estrogen leads to the activation of Akt and eNOS in human endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Simoncini1">[34]</xref>. Another study has shown that the direct interaction between estrogen receptor and the PI3K regulatory subunit p85 in a time-dependent manner was consistent with the temporal profile for Akt phosphorylation in neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Mannella1">[35]</xref>. Additionally, in cardiomyocytes, estrogen stimulated Akt activation and prevented DNA fragmentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Yu1">[29]</xref>. Thus, we propose that the higher cardiac activation of Akt in female mice importantly contributes to the improvement in cardiac dysfunction in sepsis.</p>
<p>Activation of Akt is known to modulate eNOS activity through phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser<sup>1177</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Dimmeler1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Fulton1">[37]</xref>. Indeed, the present study reported an increase in eNOS phosphorylation in female than in male hearts, which was correlated with the expression pattern of Akt. Augmentation of eNOS activity was shown to decrease sepsis-related increases in neutrophil-endothelial cell interaction and potentially maintain microvascular patency in sepsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Khan2">[38]</xref>. There is good evidence that estrogen modulates activation of eNOS. Estrogen receptor α has been implicated in increased PI3K/Akt and eNOS activation induced by estrogen in human endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Simoncini1">[34]</xref>. Another study demonstrated that estrogen stimulation of the eNOS promoter was mediated via increased activity of the transcription factor Sp1 (which is essential for the activity of the human eNOS promoter) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Kleinert1">[39]</xref>. Moreover, estradiol treatment in guinea pigs increased eNOS mRNA in skeletal muscle, suggesting an increase in eNOS activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Weiner1">[40]</xref>. In line with these findings, data from the present study indicate that less vulnerability of female hearts to sepsis may be mediated in part by an increased activity of eNOS, secondary to the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway.</p>
<p>NF-κB controls the transcription of a large number of genes, particularly those involved in inflammatory and acute stress responses, such as cytokines, chemokines, cell adhesion molecules, apoptotic factors, and other mediators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Senftleben1">[41]</xref>. IκBα inactivates NF-κB by masking the nuclear localization signals of the NF-κB proteins and by sequestering NF-κB as an inactive complex in the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Senftleben1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Jacobs1">[42]</xref>. Phosphorylation of IκBα by IκB kinase (IKK) leads to the dissociation of IκBα from NF-κB, which liberates NF-κB to enter the nucleus and activates the expression of NF-κB target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Senftleben1">[41]</xref>. Up-regulation of NF-κB has been linked to the development of myocardial dysfunction following the onset of sepsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Khan1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Kapoor1">[43]</xref>. Inhibition of NF-κB activation results in improved myocardial function after septic challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Coldewey1">[18]</xref>. Additionally, the dimer of estrogen and its receptor can bind to NF-κB in osteoblasts following IL-1β exposure, further, NF-κB is proved to be one of the targets for estrogen receptor, resulting in reduced IL-6 promoter activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Stein1">[44]</xref>. In murine splenic macrophages, estradiol inhibited TNF-α and IL-6 production was associated with a decreased LPS-induced NF-κB-binding activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Stein1">[44]</xref>. Thus, our present results indicate that less myocardial dysfunction in females subjected to LPS/PepG could be importantly due to the decreased activation of NF-κB (secondary to the reduced activation of IκBα and, hence, nuclear translocation) in murine hearts. Activation of NF-κB may also mediate myocardial dysfunction through induction of expression of its target gene iNOS, which plays an important role in sepsis-related hypotension and impaired left ventricular function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Barth1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Thiemermann1">[46]</xref>. Indeed, in the present study, iNOS expression was increased in male hearts, which correlates with their exacerbated cardiac dysfunction under septic insult.</p>
<p>In addition to causing the expression of iNOS, NF-κB activation also leads to a pronounced increase in production of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α and IL-6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Brown1">[47]</xref>. In turn, TNF also activates NF-κB through TNF-receptor-associated factors, this increases cytokine production, thus forming a feed-forward mechanism and amplifying the inflammatory reaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Miyamoto1">[48]</xref>. There is good evidence that those inflammatory cytokines play a significant role in the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Natanson1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Parrillo1">[50]</xref>. Moreover, clinical studies showed that stimulation of healthy females with LPS or LTA led to lower TNF-α and IL-6 levels in blood than males <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Aulock1">[10]</xref>. Female patients with sepsis had a higher survival rate, which was correlated with lower TNF-α and higher IL-10 levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Schroder1">[9]</xref>, while male trauma-patients showed higher IL-6 level than females <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Oberholzer1">[11]</xref>. In experimental studies, cardiomyocyte TNF-α and IL-6 release was markedly lower in female than male rats following burn injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Horton1">[23]</xref>. In addition, female hearts expressed less myocardial TNF-α in isolated hearts subjected to ischemia/reperfusion injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Wang1">[21]</xref> or LPS treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Zhu1">[51]</xref>. Others have suggested that elevated plasma TNF-α and IL-6 induced by trauma-hemorrhage was prevented by estradiol treatment in rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Hsu1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Hsieh1">[52]</xref>. Consistent with these findings, in our study, female mice, which had better cardiac function following septic insult, expressed less myocardial TNF-α and IL-6 than male mice subjected to LPS/PepG co-administration.</p>
<p>Our study demonstrated that the gender dimorphism of cardiac dysfunction in response to septic insults was abolished by the severe injury induced by high dose of LPS (9 mg/kg)/PepG (1 mg/kg) co-administration. This is in line with a report that the inflammatory cytokine response differed more strongly between blood from men and women after low-concentration of LPS stimulation compared with a higher stimulus concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Aulock1">[10]</xref>. Population-based studies on sex dimorphism in mortality after sepsis showed inconsistent results. Some studies reported increased mortality in males <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Ghuman1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Melamed1">[8]</xref>, while other studies demonstrated mortality from severe sepsis/sepsis was not affected by gender <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Mahmood1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Wichmann1">[54]</xref>. The inconsistency may have resulted from multiple factors such as pre-existing co-morbidities. More importantly, our observations of gender dimorphism in cardiac dysfunction responses to different severities of injury may partially explain the conflicting clinical data.</p>
<p>It could be argued that the present study did not provide information about proestrus/estrus or diestrus state of estrus cycle in female mice subjected to septic insults. In this regard, a recent study showed that female mice with CLP survived better than male mice that underwent CLP, but the higher survival in females did not correspond to any specific estrus phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Drechsler1">[55]</xref>. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated vaginal cytology does not reflect changes of circulating estrogens in females and that the estrus cycle cannot be predicted by vaginal smears <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100631-Weixelbaumer1">[56]</xref>. Moreover, we did not notice a lot of variations in data obtained from female mice in our study. Therefore, estrus cycle phases were not monitored in this study.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our findings provide for the first time a very clear indication of a gender dimorphism in the sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction <italic>in vivo</italic> and we have shown that female mice have less cardiac dysfunction than male mice subjected to either co-administration of LPS/PepG in young mice or CLP in older mice. We report here that female hearts subjected to sepsis have a greater activation of Akt/eNOS, and less activation of NF-κB, which in turn results in reduced expression of the proinflammaroy cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 as well as iNOS. We propose that the above pro-survival and anti-inflammatory signalling events contribute to the reduced cardiac dysfunction in female mice with sepsis.</p>
