<abstract>
<p>The use of a 3D perfusion culture environment for stem cell expansion has been shown to be beneficial for maintenance of the original cell functionality but due to several system inherent characteristics such as the presence of extracellular matrix, the continued development and implementation of 3D perfusion bioreactor technologies is hampered. Therefore, this study developed a methodology for harvesting a progenitor cell population from a 3D open porous culture surface after expansion in a perfusion bioreactor and performed a functional characterization of the expanded cells. An initial screening showed collagenase to be the most interesting reagent to release the cells from the 3D culture surface as it resulted in high yields without compromising cell viability. Subsequently a Design of Experiment approach was used to obtain optimized 3D harvest conditions by assessing the interplay of flow rate, collagenase concentration and incubation time on the harvest efficiency, viability and single cell fraction. Cells that were recovered with the optimized harvest protocol, by perfusing a 880 U/ml collagenase solution for 7 hours at a flow rate of 4 ml/min, were thereafter functionally analyzed for their characteristics as expanded progenitor cell population. As both the <italic>in vitro</italic> tri-lineage differentiation capacity and the <italic>in vivo</italic> bone forming potential were maintained after 3D perfusion bioreactor expansion we concluded that the developed seeding, culture and harvest processes did not significantly compromise the viability and potency of the cells and can contribute to the future development of integrated bioprocesses for stem cell expansion.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As the field of tissue engineering evolves towards clinical applications, the development of well characterized bioprocesses to provide consistent production of tissue engineered (TE) advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) becomes imperative. However, at current, the production of such ATMPs consists of a series of discrete manual unit operations ranging from progenitor cell isolation from donor biopsies, to cell expansion and differentiation to achieve those numbers needed for therapy and functional TE construct development. Although preliminary studies using these manual methodologies have demonstrated the potential of TE ATMPs for <italic>in vivo</italic> tissue regeneration [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], closed and integrated bioprocesses should be developed to reduce the dependence on operator expertise and minimizing risk of contamination. The use of bioreactors is considered to be essential for the successful clinical introduction of novel ATMPs in these aspects [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Next to contributing to the development of automated, controlled and monitored processes, bioreactors also enable the use of 3D cell culture substrates which were hypothesized to have beneficial effects on the characteristics of the expanding cell population such as enhanced maintenance of the original cell phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
<p>The use of perfusion bioreactors, incorporating 3D open porous inert and rigid scaffolds as 3D culture substrate for cell expansion, has been associated with significant advantages concerning the identity and potency of the resulting cell population [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In previous studies the ability of cells to grow into the third dimension leading to 3D culture surface with filled pores, has been demonstrated [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. During 3D growth, cells secrete extracellular matrix (ECM) depending, amongst others, on the flow rate employed for cell culture [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Even though the presence of a supportive ECM has been shown to possess significant advantages concerning maintenance of the potency of the expanded cells [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], cell recovery is significantly impaired, requiring dedicated process development and optimization.</p>
<p>Detachment or dissociation of cells from the culture surface with subsequent retention of cell quality is therefore equally important as cell attachment and proliferation, given that the product of interest in cell therapy applications is the cell itself [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Despite reports of adverse effects on cell characteristics [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], trypsin is one of the most widely used reagents for cell recovery and was already used for the recovery of cells from microcarrier based expansion systems [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] as well as for the digest of primary tissues, although often in combination with other enzymes which specifically target the collagen containing fraction of the ECM [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Additionally, various optimization studies for collagenase-based digestion of primary tissues such as cartilage are available indicating the feasibility of a trypsin free approach although no detailed reports are available regarding the recovery of cells from 3D culture surfaces [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
<p>Functional characterization of the expanded and recovered cell population is imperative to assess the relevance of the developed processes. Current approaches focus mainly on the <italic>in vitro</italic> characterization which enables the potential classification of the expanded population as being an adult mesenchymal stromal stem cell population [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, the final goal of these expansion processes is to obtain a progenitor cell population which can contribute to the development of an <italic>in vivo</italic> functional tissue. Therefore not only the post expansion characterization but also the functional <italic>in vivo</italic> assessment of the expanded cell population is critical [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p>
<p>In this work we expanded human periosteum derived cells (hPDCs) in a 3D flow-through perfusion bioreactor [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and monitored their growth non-destructively using the Presto Blue metabolic assay [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Upon confluence, as was confirmed by contrast enhanced X-ray nano-computed tomography (CE-nanoCT), a range of cell recovery reagents was assessed. Subsequently the most efficient harvest reagent was selected and for the harvest protocol was further optimized for the reagent concentration, flow rate used for detachment and harvest time leading to maximal cell viability and harvested single cell yield based on a Design of Experiment (DoE) approach. Finally, the functionality of the expanded progenitor cell population was defined using a combination of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> proliferation, differentiation and bone forming assays.</p>

<title>Human periosteum-derived cells (hPDCs)</title>
<p>hPDCs were isolated from periosteal biopsies obtained from 4 different donors (age 11, 13, 14 and 17, equal distribution of gender) as described previously and pooled for further use [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This procedure was approved by the ethics committee for Human Medical Research KU Leuven (ML7861). Patient informed written consent was provided by the legal guardian. hPDCs were expanded in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with high-glucose (Life Technologies) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco), 1% sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies) and 1% antibiotic–antimycotic (100 units/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 0.25 mg/mL amphotericin B; Life Technologies), further mentioned as culture medium (CM). The cells were seeded at 5,700 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> and passaged at 80%–90% confluency.

<title>Ti6Al4V scaffolds</title>
<p>For 3D perfusion bioreactor cell expansion, additive manufactured Ti6Al4V scaffolds (Ø = 6 mm, h = 6 mm) [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] were used as described before [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The total volume of the scaffolds was 166 ± 3 mm<sup>3</sup>, the available volume 130 ± 5 mm<sup>3</sup> and the available surface 7.5 ± 0.6 mm<sup>2</sup> as determined with μCT [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Scaffolds were cleaned and prepared for experiments as described before [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>

<sec id="sec005">
<title>Scaffold seeding and culture</title>
<p>Prior to the 3D culture experiments cells were harvested at passage 6 using Triple Express (Life Technologies) and drop-seeded onto the scaffolds at a final density of 120,000 cells per scaffold [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Scaffold-cell constructs were incubated overnight in standard culture conditions resulting in an initial cell density of 17,100 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> or 700,000 cells/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>For cell expansion, seeded constructs were inserted in an in-house developed perfusion bioreactor system consisting of an interconnected bioreactor chamber and a medium reservoir [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. A total volume of 10 ml CM was perfused at a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min. CM was refreshed every two days by attaching a new medium reservoir containing 10 ml fresh CM.</p>

<sec id="sec006">
<title>Presto Blue measurement</title>
<p>To monitor cell growth, a Presto Blue (PB, Life Technologies) measurement was performed every second day on quadruplicate samples as described earlier for a period of 17 days [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. 5 ml of a 9% solution was perfused for 2 hours at 1 ml/min after which three 100 μl samples were taken from each unit and the fluorescent signal was measured with a Synergy HT Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Biotek) using an excitation wavelength of 544 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The measured fluorescent signal was expressed as arbitrary fluorescent units (FU).</p>

<sec id="sec007">
<title>Calcein Acetoxymethyl staining</title>
<p>A Calcein acetoxymethyl (AM) staining was used to qualitatively visualize the distribution of live cells by optical fluorescent microscopy. At day 3, 8 and 15, representative cell loaded scaffolds (based on PB measurements) were imaged. Constructs were rinsed with 1 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS) after which they were incubated in the staining solution (0.5 μl of a 4 mM Calcein AM in anhydrous dimethylsulfoxide solution, Life technologies) for 20 min in normal cell culture conditions. The constructs were imaged using a Leica M165 FC microscope.</p>

<sec id="sec008">
<title>Contrast enhanced nano computed X-ray tomography of cell expansion constructs</title>
<p>Cell—ECM structure developed during the expansion (further mentioned as neo-tissue) was visualized using contrast enhanced CE-nanoCT [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Prior to staining constructs were fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution (Sigma) for 2 hours. To enable visualization of the neo-tissue, constructs were stained with a 60% Hexabrix 320 solution (Guerbet) for 20 min [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A Phoenix NanoTom S (GE Measurement and Control Solutions) with a 180 kV/15 W high-performance nanofocus X-ray tube was used with a tungsten target, which was operated at a voltage of 90 kV and a current of 170 μA. An aluminum and copper filter, both 1 mm thick, were used to reduce beam hardening and metal artefacts. The exposure time was 500 ms, a frame averaging of 1 and image skip of 0 were applied, resulting in a scanning time of 20 min. The obtained radiographic images were reconstructed using Phoenix Datos|X (GE Measurement and Control Solutions). The reconstructed images had an isotropic voxel size of 3.75 μm [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>

<title>Cell harvest</title>
<p>For the use of the StemPro Accutase Cell Dissociation Reagent (Life Technologies) or 0.05% Trypsin–ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution (Life Technologies) the bioreactor circuits were first rinsed with Phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Life Technologies) to remove all FBS remnants. Cell harvest using the Accutase solution was performed at a flow rate of 1ml/min up to one hour at 37°C or up to 6 hours at room temperature (incubation times and temperatures according to the manufacturer’s instructions for cell recovery and tissue dissociation). The trypsin solution was applied up to 40 min at 37°C at 1ml/min. For the collagenase IV solution (Life Technologies) a 440U/ml solution in CM was perfused at 1ml/min up to 13 hours at 37°C as was also performed for the initial digest of the periosteum [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Harvest efficiency was determined based on DNA measurements on the scaffolds after harvest and on the resulting cell suspension as described further. Scaffolds that did not receive any harvest treatment were used as a control. All conditions were performed in triplicate on constructs expanded for 13 days.</p>
<p>A DoE approach was used to further optimize the cell harvest procedure using the Collagenase IV solution. In order to determine the influence of incubation time, concentration and flow rate on the cell yield and the viability of the harvested cell population a 3-level, 3-parameter fractional factorial design was used resulting in 9 combinations of the aforementioned parameters as shown in <xref rid="pone.0136875.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The assessed range of flow rates was selected based upon pervious work where we showed that no significant influence of the fluid flow could be observed on cell proliferation between 0.04ml/min and 4ml/min [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. As the preliminary screening experiment for Collagenase IV showed no significant increase in cell yield after 7 hours this was selected as the maximal incubation time. Additionally, no negative influence of the used setup was observed on cell viability. Therefore, the assessed preliminary concentration was selected as the low value for the DoE to achieve potential higher yields using shorter incubation times using higher concentrations. Harvest efficiency was determined both based on DNA measurements and by using a hemocytometer in combination with trypan blue staining, thereby enabling to determine the viability of the resulting cell suspension. Each measurement was performed on triplicate samples obtained from 13 day cultured constructs.</p>

<title>DNA measurement</title>
<p>The DNA content of samples was determined using a highly quantitative and selective DNA assay (Quant-iT dsDNA HS kit, Life Technologies). The constructs were rinsed with PBS and lysed in 350 μl RLT lysis buffer (Qiagen) supplemented with 3.5 μl β-mercaptoethanol after which the lysed samples were vortexed for 60 s and stored at -80°C. Prior to analysis, the samples were thawed at room temperature and spun down for 1 min at 13,000 rpm. 10 μl of the sample was diluted in 90 μl milliQ water after which the DNA content was quantified with a Qubit Fluorometer (Life Technologies) [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. For measurement of DNA content of the cell suspensions resulting from the harvest procedure the cells were rinsed with PBS and re-suspended in 350 μl RLT lysis buffer supplemented with 3.5 μl β-mercaptoethanol. Further processing for the DNA measurements was identical as described for the constructs.</p>

<p>In order to determine the proliferative capacity of cells expanded in the 3D perfusion bioreactor cells were seeded at a density of 10,000 cells/well in a standard 24-well cell culture plate (Nunc) and cultured for 6 days in CM (n = 4). Proliferation was monitored daily using the Presto Blue metabolic assay by replacing the growth medium with 0.5ml of a 9% Presto Blue solution and incubating for 2 hours.

<p><italic>In vivo</italic> bone forming capacity was evaluated using an ectopic implantation model [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. NuOss, a porous bone mineral matrix material (ACE surgical Sypply CO), and Bio-Oss, a bone substitute for regenerative dentistry (Geistlich), were used as a scaffold material. Cylindrical scaffolds with a diameter and height of 3 mm were punched out of the raw material and drop seeded with 1,000,000 2D or 3D expanded cells in a volume of 25 μl (n = 3 or 4 respectively for the Bio-Oss and NuOss scaffolds). Scaffolds were incubated overnight at 37°C in 3 ml of CM to allow cell attachment after which they were implanted ectopically in the back at the cervical region and the lower back of female NMRI-nu/nu mice as described previously [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Empty scaffolds were implanted as negative control. The total of 21 scaffolds were randomly distributed between the 6 experimental animals and grouped per scaffold type. The implants were collected after 8 weeks of implantation and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The animals were sacrificed using cervical dislocation. The volume of mineralized tissue in the explants was quantified using nanoCT as described further on, after which they were decalcified in EDTA/PBS (pH 7.5) for 14 days, embedded in paraffin and processed for haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) as well as Masson’s Trichrome staining. All procedures on animal experiments were approved by the local ethical committee for Animal Research, KU Leuven (P171-2011).

<title>nanoCT based quantification of mineralized tissue volume</title>
<p>For visualization and quantification of the mineralized tissue volume the same system was used as for the neo-tissue visualization in the perfusion bioreactor expanded constructs but the tungsten target was operated at a voltage of 60 kV and a current of 210 μA. A 1 mm thick aluminum filter was used to reduce beam hardening and the isentropic voxel size was 3μm.</p>
<p>The resulting transaxial images were analyzed by CTAn (Skyscan NV). Images were segmented into three distinct phases (background, mineralized tissue and scaffold grains) using a 2-Level, 3D multilevel Otsu algorithm generating grayscale images with distinct grayscale values for each fraction. A global threshold was applied to select the scaffold fraction upon which a closing of 1 voxel was applied in combination with a despeckling operation of 200 voxels (black and white) to remove image noise prior to analysis of the scaffold volume. In order to prevent edge effects and the correlated partial volume effect from influencing quantification of the bone volume the selected scaffold fraction was subsequently dilatated with 1 voxel and subsequently subtracted from the original grayscale images. The grayscales corresponding with the newly formed bone were selected and image noise was removed as performed for the scaffold fraction prior to volumetric analysis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite the need for the development of methods for cell recovery from 3D cell culture substrates this still remains a largely unexplored field [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Although recently the use of microcarrier based expansion systems has started to receive more attention, differences between these and other culture setups hamper the translation of existing harvest techniques across setups [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We therefore developed and optimized a dynamic methodology that enabled the recovery of cells from a 3D culture substrate after which the functional characteristics of the expanded cell population was assessed and compared to established 2D cultured cells.</p>
<p>Using metabolic activity measurements, which are directly correlated with the total cell number [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the time-point for cell recovery was set at 13 days to ensure maximum cell expansion and prevent over-confluence (<xref rid="pone.0136875.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Both the Calcein AM staining and the CE-nanoCT showed that the 3D culture environment was gradually being filled by cells and ECM resulting in 3D confluency by day 15 where no further hPDC expansion was expected [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The decrease of metabolic activity measurements at subsequent time points further indicated that cell growth ceased at this time point.</p>
<p>In order to choose the most suitable harvest reagent for cell recovery the use of Trypsin/EDTA, Accutase and collagenase IV was evaluated (<xref rid="pone.0136875.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Trypsin and Accutase are commonly used reagents for cell recovery from 2D cell culture substrates on which cells grow predominantly in a monolayer such as standard 2D cell expansion systems or microcarriers [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The loss of cells observed using trypsin and Accutase (respectively up to 35% and 57%) could be explained by the mechanism by which they act. Both agents are known to specifically cleave peptide chains at the carboxyl site of lysine or arginine. They will therefore cleave extracellular proteins as well as trans-membrane associated structures leading to the time dependent increase in cell loss observed for both solutions. Most setups (always 2D) therefore use a maximal incubation time of 10 to 15 minutes [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Additionally, trypsin it is known to be unable to cleave the helical structures of the collagen fibers, hence limiting its capacity to degrade the <italic>in vitro</italic> deposited collagen. As this is a major constituent of the ECM its application for cell recovery from a 3D cell culture environment within which abundant ECM is present is therefore suboptimal. Prolonging the incubation with trypsin in our system did consequently not result in an increased release of the cells from the deposited ECM but, as shown in <xref rid="pone.0136875.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, only resulted in progressive damage to the expanded cell population. The use of a pure collagenolytic solution was expected to prevent this proteolytic related cell degradation as these enzymes specifically target the peptide bounds in collagen. As this is a major constituent of the ECM but is not present in the cell membranes it was successfully used previously for the recovery of primary cells from various tissues [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and application in our system resulted in a successful recovery with an overall cell recovery efficiency of up to 92% (<xref rid="pone.0136875.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>Expanding further on the successful application of the collagenase IV solution for the recovery of single cells from the 3D culture substrate a DoE approach was employed to optimize its use. Prolonged exposure to collagenase (between 10 and 24 hrs) was previously shown to affect cell viability for the digest of primary tissues [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and as the strongest increase in yield was observed during the first 7 hours in the screening experiments (<xref rid="pone.0136875.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>), this was chosen as the maximal incubation time for the DoE study. None of the studied parameters showed a linear influence on the viability of the recovered cell population within the examined operating window which was on average 96% (<xref rid="pone.0136875.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A and 3E</xref>). Concentration and incubation time were shown to have a significant effect on both overall harvest efficiency and single cell yield while flow rate only had a significant positive effect on the single cell yield (<xref rid="pone.0136875.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B, 3C, 3F and 3G</xref>). The single cell fraction was positively influenced by a high incubation time and flow rate resulting in a continued dissociation of the aggregates into a single cell suspension as was shown earlier for different stem cell aggregate systems (<xref rid="pone.0136875.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D and 3H</xref>)[<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. No adverse effects related to shear stress on cell viability were observed in accordance with previous studies for comparable flow regimes as the maximal shear stress experienced by the cells in the tubing was approximately 2 mPa [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. This was evidenced by unaffected single cell viability while the cumulative DNA content of the cells remaining on the 3D culture substrate and in the harvested suspension was equal to that of the post expansion, pre-harvest culture environment (as also shown in <xref rid="pone.0136875.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the fact that no adverse effects of the applied procedure on the cell viability were detected the metabolic activity of the hPDCs was significantly decreased after replating in comparison to standard 2D expanded cells (<xref rid="pone.0136875.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). Adverse effects of prolonged use of a collagenase solution between 10 and 24 hours were reported for the digest of primary tissues which could result in a decrease of the metabolic activity of the harvested cell population [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Recent work also showed cells to possess a “mechanical memory” which can influence their behavior depending on the previous physical environments used for culture [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The switch from the complex, ECM containing 3D culture environment in the perfusion bioreactor system to the standard tissue culture plastic might therefore also influence the metabolic activity of the recovered hPDC cell population and might result in an initial lower metabolic activity.</p>
<p>Maintenance of the <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation potential of a progenitor cell population expanded in bioreactor systems has been reported for several MSC cell sources and was also observed in our system (<xref rid="pone.0136875.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The observed increase in calcium depositions and decrease in GAG accumulation suggest an osteogenic priming of the expanded cell population (<xref rid="pone.0136875.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). In previously published work we already hypothesized that the shear stress exerted on the cells during expansion might result in osteogenic priming of the expanded cell population based on the up regulation of certain gene markers associated with osteogenic differentiation which is further substantiated by this data [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although the 3D perfusion bioreactor expansion of primary MSCs was previously shown to result in enhanced <italic>in vitro</italic> osteo-, chondro- and adipogenic differentiation potential as well as an enhanced clonogenicity of freshly isolated primary MSCs [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], we only observed an increase in osteogenic differentiation (<xref rid="pone.0136875.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). The cells used for this study were however pre-expanded for multiple passages using standard cell culture methodologies, including the use of plasma treated polystyrene. This has been correlated with the progressive loss of the progenitor cell phenotype and commitment to the osteogenic lineage indicating that the differences in post expansion differentiation potential for primary cells might originate from an enhanced maintenance of the progenitor cell phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The initial 2D expansion of the hPDC population used for this work could therefore explain the absence of a significant difference in differentiation potential between 2D and 3D expanded cells in this culture setup.</p>
<p>Post expansion cell characterization is currently focused on cell identity as established by <italic>in vitro</italic> assays [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136875.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] while their functionality as evidenced by their performance in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models is largely subsided. Furthermore the lack of such data hinders the development of correlations that will eventually allow to link <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> cell behavior [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge no reports exist assessing the <italic>in vivo</italic> potency of a progenitor cell population after expansion and recovery in a 3D bioreactor system despite the need for adequate <italic>in vivo</italic> controls for the validation of these processes [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We therefore assessed the <italic>in vivo</italic> bone forming capacity of the 3D expanded and recovered cells in a standard ectopic bone formation assay [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Histological staining showed the clear presence of bone spicules in all cell seeded conditions (<xref rid="pone.0136875.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). In addition, the presence of bone marrow lacunae and blood vessels was unimpaired in comparison to their 2D control indicating the unaffected <italic>in vivo</italic> differentiation capacity of the 3D expanded cells. This was further confirmed and quantified by nanoCT analysis where no differences between 2D and 3D expanded cells were apparent (<xref rid="pone.0136875.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>) and observed volumes of newly formed bone were comparable to what was shown earlier [<xref rid="pone.0136875.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
<p>In conclusion, we optimized a closed bioprocess enabling the expansion and recovery of a viable cell population. The produced cell population showed minor differences in its <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation potential as compared to the 2D standard while it showed an uncompromised bone forming potential upon ectopic implantation. The development of this multi-unit integrated bioprocess shows the potential for integrated bioprocess development and sets the scene for the continued integrated optimization of current manual tissue engineering strategies to a clinical relevant setting.</p>
