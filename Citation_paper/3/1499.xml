<abstract>
<p>Shiga toxin-producing <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (STEC) cause infections in humans ranging from asymptomatic carriage to bloody diarrhoea and haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Here we present whole genome comparison of Norwegian non-O157 STEC strains with the aim to distinguish between strains with the potential to cause HUS and less virulent strains. Whole genome sequencing and comparisons were performed across 95 non-O157 STEC strains. Twenty-three of these were classified as HUS-associated, including strains from patients with HUS (n = 19) and persons with an epidemiological link to a HUS-case (n = 4). Genomic comparison revealed considerable heterogeneity in gene content across the 95 STEC strains. A clear difference in gene profile was observed between strains with and without the Locus of Enterocyte Effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island. Phylogenetic analysis of the core genome showed high degree of diversity among the STEC strains, but all HUS-associated STEC strains were distributed in two distinct clusters within phylogroup B1. However, non-HUS strains were also found in these clusters. A number of accessory genes were found to be significantly overrepresented among HUS-associated STEC, but none of them were unique to this group of strains, suggesting that different sets of genes may contribute to the pathogenic potential in different phylogenetic STEC lineages. In this study we were not able to clearly distinguish between HUS-associated and non-HUS non-O157 STEC by extensive genome comparisons. Our results indicate that STECs from different phylogenetic backgrounds have independently acquired virulence genes that determine pathogenic potential, and that the content of such genes is overlapping between HUS-associated and non-HUS strains.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Shiga toxin producing <italic>E. coli</italic> (STEC) are important human pathogens known to cause infections ranging from diarrhoea and haemorrhagic colitis to haemorrhagic uremic syndrome (HUS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Croxen1">[1]</xref>. Since the first reports of disease caused by O157:H7 in 1982 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Karmali1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Riley1">[3]</xref>, this serotype has been the most frequently reported cause of severe STEC disease and outbreaks worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Croxen1">[1]</xref>. However, several non-O157 STEC serogroups (<italic>e.g.</italic> O26, O45, O103, O111, O121 and O145) have also been recognized to be responsible for severe disease and outbreaks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Gould1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-European1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>The STEC pathotype is defined by the presence of Shiga toxins Stx1 and Stx2 encoded by the <italic>stx1</italic> and <italic>stx2</italic> genes, which are acquired through horizontal gene transfer of a heterogeneous group of lambdoid bacteriophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Allison1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Smith1">[9]</xref>. There are several subtypes of Shiga toxins, of which the Stx2 subtypes Stx2a, Stx2c and Stx2d are more often associated with HUS than other Stx subtypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Bielaszewska1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Scheutz1">[13]</xref>. In addition, the adherence factor intimin, encoded by the <italic>eae</italic> gene located in the Locus of Enterocyte Effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island, is important for STEC pathogenicity. STEC causing severe disease and outbreaks do usually harbour LEE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Croxen1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Delannoy1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Mellmann1">[15]</xref>, although also LEE negative STEC are sometimes found in patients with severe disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Mellmann1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Frank1">[21]</xref>. LEE encodes several genes responsible for the attaching and effacing nature of STEC, a feature that these bacteria share with the closely related enteropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> (EPEC). In addition, the LEE encodes additional associated regulators, translocators, effector proteins and chaperones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Garmendia1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Mcdaniel1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>Whole genome sequencing of bacterial genomes has become an accessible and affordable analysis. Comparison of whole genome sequences provides information on gene content and organization, and gives an overview of how organisms are related. Whole genome sequences available of STEC and other <italic>E. coli</italic> have demonstrated high diversity among different <italic>E. coli</italic> genomes, due to horizontal gene transfer, gene loss and other genomic alterations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Steyert1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Hayashi1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Lukjancenko1">[34]</xref>. Genomic comparisons of O157 and non-O157 LEE positive STEC genomes with other <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Shigella</italic> have also revealed that LEE positive STEC in general have larger genomes, mostly due to horizontally transferred DNA such as prophage DNA, plasmids and integrative elements encoding potential virulence factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Hayashi1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Perna1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>In Norway non-O157 STEC are more frequently isolated from patients with STEC disease than O157, and are also more common than O157 STEC in patients suffering from HUS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Jenssen1">[35]</xref>. Although whole genome sequence comparisons of O157 and non-O157 STEC are available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Steyert1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Ogura1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Hazen1">[28]</xref>, it is still unclear whether it is possible to differentiate between STEC strains based on their potential to cause HUS. In this study our main aim was to compare whole genome sequences from 95 non-O157 human STEC strains to investigate potential genetic differences suitable for distinguishing between highly pathogenic STEC having caused HUS and low-virulent STEC having caused only mild disease or asymptomatic carriage. We were not able to clearly distinguish between HUS-associated and non-HUS non-O157 STEC by extensive genome comparisons in this study. Our results indicate that STEC from different phylogenetic backgrounds have independently acquired virulence genes that determine pathogenic potential, and that the content of such genes is overlapping between HUS-associated and non-HUS strains. To our knowledge this is the largest collection of non-O157 STEC strains that has been sequenced to date, thus providing valuable data on the less characterized STEC serotypes.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Sequencing and whole genome comparison of the 95 non-O157 STEC strains included in this study revealed high degree of variation in gene content as well as diversity in whole genome phylogeny. A total of 1,954 genes represented the core genome among the 95 strains, while 26,073 genes represented the pan genome. The LEE pathogenicity island was identified in 54 (57%) of the genomes, whereas 41 (43%) of the sequenced STEC strains were LEE negative (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111788-t001">Table 1</xref>). Stx genes were detected in 84 (88%) genomes; <italic>stx1</italic> in 35 (37%), <italic>stx2</italic> in 37 (39%) and a combination of <italic>stx1</italic> and <italic>stx2</italic> in 12 (13%) of the genomes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111788-t001">Table 1</xref>). Eleven (12%) of the sequenced genomes which did not harbour stx genes, were classified as STEC-LST (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111788-t001">Table 1</xref>). The <italic>stx2</italic> subtypes were differently distributed: <italic>stx2a</italic> was significantly more frequent among LEE positive STEC, while <italic>stx2b</italic> was more frequent among LEE negative strains (p&lt;0.05 for both analyses) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111788-t001">Table 1</xref>). Of the <italic>stx1</italic> subtypes, <italic>stx1c</italic> was significantly associated with LEE negative STEC.</p>

<title>Phylogenetic analysis of the core genome</title>
<p>A core gene tree was constructed from alignment of the 1,861 core genes present in all the 95 STEC and 14 <italic>E. coli</italic> reference genomes representing the <italic>E. coli</italic> phylogroups (109 genomes in total). In this phylogenetic tree, the 95 strains were distributed in the <italic>E. coli</italic> phylogroups A, B1, B2, D and E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111788-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In general, clusters of LEE negative STEC strains were distributed between clusters of LEE positive strains. Most of the strains belonged to the B1 phylogroup, and a majority of the LEE positive STEC strains were also found within this group. All HUS-associated strains were found in phylogroup B1, in two clusters which we designated HUS-group 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111788-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The STEC strains in HUS-group 1 were distributed in three related clusters, consisting of mainly HUS and HUS-associated strains of serotypes O103:H25, O145:H[unknown], and O121:H- (n = 18) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111788-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111788.s001">Figure S1</xref>). HUS-group 2 consisted of one distinct cluster of strains (n = 23), in which all HUS and HUS-associated STEC strains of serogroups O26, O86 and O111 were located. Sixteen of the strains in HUS-group 2, of which 13 strains were of serogroup O26, were not associated with HUS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111788-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111788.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This group therefore appeared to be more heterogeneous than HUS-group 1 with respect to pathogenicity.</p>

<title>Comparative analysis of the accessory genome</title>
<p>The accessory genome consisted of approximately 24,000 genes. PCA of the accessory genome separated LEE positive (n = 54, Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111788.s003">File S1</xref>) and LEE negative (n = 41) STEC strains in two distinct groups (data not shown). PCA and PLS regression of LEE positive strains (n = 54) as well as of LEE positive/<italic>stx2</italic> positive strains (n = 33, Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111788.s003">File S1</xref>) could not further separate the strains into subgroups. In a random forest analysis of the accessory genome in the LEE positive strains (n = 54) 18 of the 23 HUS-associated strains were correctly classified as HUS-strains, whereas 29 of the 31 non-HUS strains were correctly classified (Table S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111788.s004">File S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111788.s002">Figure S2</xref>). However, a perfect separation of the two groups could not be achieved.</p>
<p>By comparison of all 54 LEE positive STEC strains, we identified eleven genes which were more frequent in the HUS-associated strains (n = 23) and four genes which were more frequent in non-HUS STEC strains (n = 31) (p&lt;0.01, FDR) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111788-t002">Table 2</xref>, Table S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111788.s004">File S2</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we have performed comparative genomic analyses on what to our knowledge is the largest collection so far of genome-sequenced non-O157 STEC strains, in order to investigate if there were genetic differences suitable for distinguishing between highly pathogenic STEC having caused HUS and low-virulent STEC having caused only mild disease or asymptomatic carriage. Whole genome sequencing and comparison revealed that there was considerable heterogeneity in genetic content across the 95 non-O157 STEC strains included in the study. The approximately 24,000 genes constituting the accessory genome contribute to this heterogeneity, while 1,954 core genes were shared by all the sequenced strains. Much of the accessory genome contained various mobile genetic elements, which have also previously been shown to contribute to heterogeneity and pathogenic evolution in <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Hayashi1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Perna1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Rasko1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Jackson1">[36]</xref>. The results from principal component analysis of the accessory genome where LEE positive strains were separated from LEE negative strains, is in line with several previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Delannoy1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Steyert1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Hazen1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Bugarel1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Tobe1">[42]</xref>. Although the accessory genome was not identical within LEE positive STEC strains, further PCA analysis of LEE positive strains showed scattering of the strains without any distinct subgroups. Furthermore, although random forest analysis showed a slightly better classification than PCA, it could not classify all strains correctly, indicating that variable accessory gene content was heterogeneously distributed within this group.</p>
<p>The various <italic>stx1</italic> and <italic>stx2</italic> subtypes were differentially distributed between LEE positive and LEE negative STEC strains, i.e. <italic>stx2b</italic> and <italic>stx1c</italic> were more frequent among LEE negative strains (p&lt;0.05) while <italic>stx2a</italic> was more frequent among LEE positive strains (p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111788-t001">Table 1</xref>). All HUS associated STEC in this study were LEE positive and contained <italic>stx2a</italic>, except for the STEC-LST (strains that have lost Shiga toxin). Thus our results are in accordance with previous studies where Stx2a has been shown to possess higher potency than Stx1 and other Stx2 subtypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Fuller1">[43]</xref>, and that LEE positive and <italic>stx2a</italic> positive STEC strains are more often associated with severe disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Persson1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Mellmann1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Fuller1">[43]</xref>. Furthermore, all the HUS-associated STEC belonged to <italic>E. coli</italic> O serogroups known to be associated with STEC disease (Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111788.s003">File S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Croxen1">[1]</xref>. However, although <italic>stx2a</italic> and LEE were typical for the HUS-associated STEC, these characteristics are not unique for such STEC, and thus not sufficient to clearly distinguish HUS-associated from non-HUS STEC. We therefore aimed to compare the accessory genomes of <italic>stx2a/</italic>LEE positive STEC in an attempt to differentiate between HUS-associated and non-HUS strains. This analysis revealed that certain genes were overrepresented among HUS-associated STEC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111788-t002">Table 2</xref>, Tables S3, S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111788.s004">File S2</xref>), suggesting that strains with this gene profile have a high pathogenic potential. However, none of the genes were exclusive for these strains, which further suggest that the gene content in HUS-associated STEC at least in part is shared with non-HUS STEC strains, or that different HUS strains have different gene content.</p>
<p>Core genome phylogeny revealed that the 95 non-O157 STEC strains were distributed over all the <italic>E. coli</italic> phylogroups except phylogroup F, confirming that the strains included in this study were heterogeneous. The majority of strains belonged to phylogroup B1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111788-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Most of the LEE positive and all the HUS-associated strains in this study also clustered in this phylogroup, similarly to what has been reported in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Mellmann1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Hazen1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Reid1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Kaas1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-EscobarParamo1">[44]</xref>. In addition, LEE negative STEC associated with HUS often belong to this phylogroup <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Steyert1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Kaas1">[33]</xref>, including the O104:H4 strain (FHI102) related to the 2011 German outbreak, which did however not cluster with any of the HUS and HUS-associated STEC strains in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111788-g001">Figure 1</xref>). LEE negative and LEE positive STEC did not form separate phylogenetic clusters, but were mixed in small clusters within several phylogroups as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Steyert1">[20]</xref>. This indicates that the LEE pathogenicity island has been independently taken up by different STEC lineages at different time points. Because HUS-associated O103, O121 and O145 strains were distributed in three related clusters in the phylogenetic analysis, these STEC strains were classified as HUS-group 1, although they did not belong to one defined cluster. The remaining HUS-associated strains were located in one cluster which we termed HUS-group 2. This clustering of HUS-associated strains based on variation in core genes as observed in this study indicates that the phylogenetic backgrounds of the bacteria at least to some extent determine the pathogenic potential of the organism. In an attempt to search for unique genes in these groups, we analysed the accessory genome and identified several hundred genes that were significantly overrepresented in both groups, suggesting that different sets of genes may contribute to the pathogenic potential in different phylogenetic STEC lineages. However, few of these genes were found to be unique to any of the groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111788-t002">Table 2</xref>, Tables S5, S6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111788.s004">File S2</xref>), which further suggest that the accessory genome is shared both between and within the different clusters defined by the core genome phylogeny.</p>
<p>The majority of strains in HUS-group 2 were of serotype O26, of which HUS-associated strains clustered with non-HUS strains, suggesting that accessory factors rather than core genes defines pathogenic potential within this group. Regardless, it was not possible to identify any genes in the accessory genome which could reliably distinguish HUS-associated from non-HUS strains of the same serogroup in HUS-group 2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111788-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>In the core genome of the 95 STEC strain included in this study, we identified approximately 13,000 different gene variants by edit distance analysis. However, despite the high number of gene variants, differences in protein sequences were identified for only 13 of these variants. Comparison of the core gene variants revealed that although 281 gene variants were overrepresented in HUS-associated STEC, several of these were also present in strains not associated with HUS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111788-t002">Table 2</xref>, Table S9 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111788.s004">File S2</xref>). The observation that none of the identified gene variants were unique to HUS-associated STEC is supported by the fact that HUS-associated strains clustered to more than one group in the core gene phylogeny. Also for the O26 strains, although PLS regression revealed that serogroup O26 strains in HUS group 2 containing <italic>stx2</italic> were separated from strains that contained <italic>stx1</italic>, no core gene variants were found to be significantly over- or underrepresented in either of these two groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111788-t002">Table 2</xref>, Table S10 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111788.s004">File S2</xref>).</p>
<p>By comparing the genomes of the STEC strains which were epidemiologically linked and belonged to the same MLVA outbreak cluster (Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111788.s003">File S1</xref>), we identified a number of genes that were different across HUS and non-HUS strains (Table S12 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111788.s005">File S3</xref>). The fact that different genes were present in strains from the same outbreak might indicate that the infecting source consisted of a mixture of similar but not identical STEC which could have evolved from the same clone. Regardless, we could not identify any genes that clearly distinguished between the HUS and non-HUS associated strains within each of these outbreak clusters.</p>
<p>GO terms related to L-idonate degradation were found to be enriched both among all 23 HUS-associated STEC strains collectively and the strains in HUS-group 1. <italic>E. coli</italic> is able to utilize L-idonate as a sole carbohydrate source through the Entner-Doudoroff metabolic pathway, which has been shown to be important for the ability of <italic>E. coli</italic> to colonize mammalian intestines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Peekhaus1">[45]</xref>. In addition, we identified enriched GO terms for protein secretion by the type II secretion system in HUS-group 1. The type II secretion system in Gram negative bacteria promotes protein transport across the outer membrane, and the majority of proteins exported by this system contribute to bacterial adaptation and colonization by generating nutrients available for uptake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Nivaskumar1">[46]</xref>. Furthermore, certain exported lipoproteins have been shown to be involved in biofilm formation in EPEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Baldi1">[47]</xref>. Genes responsible for the enriched GO terms could therefore contribute to enhanced bacterial colonization and adaptation, which might have an impact on bacterial virulence in these specific strains. This however needs to be confirmed in further investigations. Of the 26 GO terms that were enriched in HUS group 2, a few were related to flagellar motility, which in general are recognized as virulence factors in bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Duan1">[48]</xref>. In addition, enriched GO terms were related to siderophore biosynthesis. Siderophores, being iron chelating compounds, are important for iron acquisition in bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Ratledge1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Saha1">[50]</xref>. The specific siderophore identified among strains in HUS-group 2 was encoded on a high-pathogenicity island (HPI) found in a distinct clonal lineages of STEC, which includes serogroup O26 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Karch1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Bielaszewska2">[52]</xref>. These results indicate that both motility and iron acquisition might be important factors for bacterial virulence of STEC in HUS-group 2. However, the precise role of these genes for STEC pathogenesis needs to be explored in further studies.</p>
<p>In addition to bacterial factors, it is clear that infection dose and host factors like the immune system, expression of the Shiga toxin receptor and intestinal environment might also affect STEC virulence, and thus severity of STEC disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Schuller1">[53]</xref>. In this study, all patients with HUS were &lt;5 years old, which is known to be a risk factor for severe STEC disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Centers1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-European2">[55]</xref>. Unfortunately we could not obtain further information on host factors, but it is possible that such factors play an important part in explaining why highly similar strains lead to such different clinical outcomes in different patients.</p>
<p>In our study we included all non-O157 STEC strains from HUS-patients in Norway. However, these represent only a limited number of STEC strains from each phylogenetic lineage or serotype. Furthermore, few epidemiologically linked HUS and non-HUS STEC strains were included in the study. For future studies, if more STEC strains associated with HUS were included in the genomic comparisons this would give more strength both to phylogenetic and to statistical analyses. In addition, even if highly virulent STEC strains share overlapping genetic content with less pathogenic strains, further investigations regarding factors regulating transcription and translation as well as transcriptomics and proteomics analyses could shed further light into STEC virulence and pathogenicity.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this study whole genome sequencing and comparisons of 95 non-O157 STEC strains revealed that there were considerable genetic and phylogenetic heterogeneity between the strains. Although all HUS-associated STEC strains belonged to the B1 phylogroup, all non-O157 STEC from HUS patients did not cluster together, but were found in two separate clusters within this phylogenetic group. A clear difference in gene profile was observed between LEE positive and LEE negative STEC. A number of accessory genes were found to be significantly overrepresented among HUS-associated STEC, but none of them were unique to this group of strains. Our results indicate that STEC from different phylogenetic backgrounds independently have acquired virulence genes that determine pathogenic potential, and that specific genes overrepresented among HUS strains are not necessarily shared by all such strains, but that different sets of genes may contribute to the pathogenic potential in different phylogenetic STEC lineages.</p>

<p>We selected 94 non-O157 STEC strains from the strain collection at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (Oslo, Norway) isolated in 2000–2012 for sequencing in this study (Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111788.s003">File S1</xref>). In addition, three STEC strains (St. Olav104, St. Olav143 and St. Olav172, Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111788.s003">File S1</xref>) were selected from the strain collection at St. Olavs Hospital (Trondheim, Norway). The strains included in the study were primarily selected to represent different MLVA genotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Lindstedt1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Lobersli1">[57]</xref>, a diversity of non-O157 STEC serotypes and patients with different severity of disease (Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111788.s003">File S1</xref>). All available non-O157 STEC strains isolated from patients with HUS (n = 20) in Norway were included, except one strain (FHI10) which after whole genome sequencing was shown to be contaminated (Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111788.s003">File S1</xref>). Thus, a total of 96 strains were included in the study (Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111788.s003">File S1</xref>).</p>
<p>Some of the STEC strains from patients with HUS were from outbreaks and therefore had identical MLVA-genotypes or belonged to the same MLVA-genotype clusters (Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111788.s003">File S1</xref>). Four of the STEC strains included were furthermore classified as HUS-associated because they had identical MLVA-genotype as or belonged to the same MLVA-genotype cluster as a HUS case (Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111788.s003">File S1</xref>). Five of the STEC strains were from non-human sources and were isolated during various outbreak investigations related to STEC disease (Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111788.s003">File S1</xref>). One of these was designated as HUS-associated (FHI16, Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111788.s003">File S1</xref>). Of the total 96 STEC strains included in the study, 95 strains were included for genomic comparison throughout the whole study whereas one strain (St. Olav104) was included for parts of the study only. In addition, 14 <italic>E. coli</italic> were included as reference strains for classification of the STEC strains into the <italic>E. coli</italic> phylogroups A, B1, B2, D, E, and F (Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111788.s003">File S1</xref>).</p>
<p>Primary characterization of STEC at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and St. Olavs Hospital had been based on PCR for the <italic>stx1</italic>, <italic>stx2</italic> and <italic>eae</italic> genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Brandal1">[58]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Haugum1">[60]</xref>. Ninety-one strains then had contained the <italic>stx1</italic> and/or <italic>stx2</italic> genes, while six strains of serotype O103:H25 did not have <italic>stx</italic> genes at inclusion time (Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111788.s003">File S1</xref>). The six <italic>stx</italic> gene negative O103:H25 strains were included in the study because they were isolated from patients with HUS in an outbreak (five strains), or was isolated from fermented sausage linked to this specific outbreak (one strain) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Schimmer1">[61]</xref> (Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111788.s003">File S1</xref>). In this outbreak, <italic>stx2a</italic> was detected in only two of the isolated strains. As <italic>stx</italic> negative derivates of STEC causing HUS occasionally are shed by HUS patients, the six strains without <italic>stx</italic> genes were regarded as STEC that had lost their <italic>stx</italic> genes, often termed EHEC/STEC-LST <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Bielaszewska3">[62]</xref>. Fifty-five of the STEC strains were positive for the LEE pathogenicity island, as detected by the presence of the <italic>eae</italic> gene.</p>
<p>Serotyping was performed at the National Reference Laboratory for Enteropathogenic Bacteria at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, using monospesific O:K and H antisera by a combination of in-house antisera before 2002, and by antisera from Sifin (Germany) and SSI (Denmark) after 2002, covering altogether 44 O-serogroups including O26, O103, O111, O121, O145, O157; and 8 H-antigens. Twenty-four of the strains included in the study did not belong to any of the serogroups tested for (Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111788.s003">File S1</xref>).</p>

Reference protein sequences were downloaded for each Stx subtype and Stx type variant from GenBank <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Scheutz1">[13]</xref>. Amino acid sequences of the A and B subunits were concatenated and aligned separately for Stx1 and Stx2 using Clustal O in Jalview <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Waterhouse1">[78]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111788-Sievers1">[79]</xref>. For cluster analysis and tree calculations the Neighbour Joining algorithm in Jalview using % identity was used. Clustering of the Stx protein sequences of the sequenced strains with reference sequences was used to classify the former into Stx1 and Stx2 subtypes.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Fisher’s exact test was used to analyse if specific <italic>stx</italic> subtypes were differently distributed in LEE positive and LEE negative STEC, with a p-value ≤0.05 regarded as statistically significant. Fisher’s exact test was also used to test if specific genes in the accessory genome were overrepresented, and for overrepresentation of gene variants in the core genome, in subgroups of the 95 STEC strains. Classification of the strains into subgroups was based on clinical and outbreak investigation information, phylogenetic analysis, and PCA and PLS regression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111788-t002">Table 2</xref>). For corrections of false discovery rate (FDR) in multiple testing the Benjamini-Hochberg method was used, with FDR≤0.01 regarded as statically significant. Whenever no significant association was identified after FDR correction, results for uncorrected analysis are given. The statistical analyses were performed using the R software package version 3.03 (R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.R-project.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.R-project.org</ext-link>). In addition, in Blast2GO, Fisher’s exact test was used for GO enrichment analysis.</p>

<p>Unrooted core gene phylogeny. Unrooted core gene tree of the 95 sequenced non-O157 STEC and 14 <italic>E. coli</italic> reference genomes. The <italic>E. coli</italic> phylogroups are marked with the colours blue (A), green (B1), orange (B2), yellow (D), ochre (F) and indigo (E). LEE positive STEC were marked with a #-sign, while all HUS and HUS-associated STEC included in the study were coloured with red letters. HUS-group 1 consisted of 18 STEC strains in three related clusters, mainly strains of serotypes O103:H25, O145:H[unknown], and O121:H-. HUS-group 2 consisted of 23 STEC strains in one cluster, mainly strains of serogroups O26, O86 and O111.</p>
