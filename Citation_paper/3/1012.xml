<abstract>
<p>We assessed and compared abiotic preferences of aquatic macroinvertebrates in three river basins located in Ecuador, Ethiopia and Vietnam. Upon using logistic regression models we analyzed the relationship between the probability of occurrence of five macroinvertebrate families, ranging from pollution tolerant to pollution sensitive, (Chironomidae, Baetidae, Hydroptilidae, Libellulidae and Leptophlebiidae) and physical-chemical water quality conditions. Within the investigated physical-chemical ranges, nine out of twenty-five interaction effects were significant. Our analyses suggested river basin dependent associations between the macroinvertebrate families and the corresponding physical-chemical conditions. It was found that pollution tolerant families showed no clear abiotic preference and occurred at most sampling locations, i.e. Chironomidae were present in 91%, 84% and 93% of the samples taken in Ecuador, Ethiopia and Vietnam. Pollution sensitive families were strongly associated with dissolved oxygen and stream velocity, e.g. Leptophlebiidae were only present in 48%, 2% and 18% of the samples in Ecuador, Ethiopia and Vietnam. Despite some limitations in the study design, we concluded that associations between macroinvertebrates and abiotic conditions can be river basin-specific and hence are not automatically transferable across river basins in the tropics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Benthic macroinvertebrates have often been used for water quality monitoring and assessment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Rosenberg1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Kerans1">[2]</xref>. They are direct measures of stream conditions, integrate human and natural stressors over a long period of time and reflect the quality of their surroundings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Cairns1">[3]</xref>. Benthic macroinvertebrates can be used as bio-indicators since different macroinvertebrate taxa have different tolerances to pollution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Molozzi1">[4]</xref>. Therefore, benthic macroinvertebrates are suitable for assessing the ecological state of aquatic ecosystems. Macroinvertebrate-based water quality assessment methods have increasingly been applied in national monitoring campaigns (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Chutter1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Gabriels1">[6]</xref>). In the United Kingdom, macroinvertebrate-based water quality assessment has been applied since 1970 by means of the Chandler Score <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Chandler1">[7]</xref>. In later years, the biological monitoring working party (BMWP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Armitage1">[8]</xref>) was developed and accepted as a standard international biotic index. In various regions biotic indices have been applied using a derivate of the BMWP, including the Iberian BMWP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-AlbaTercedor1">[9]</xref> and the South African Scoring System (SASS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Chutter1">[5]</xref>). In tropical countries, water quality assessment has been primarily performed based on physical-chemical water quality measurements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Couceiro1">[10]</xref>. However, in recent years, macroinvertebrate-based water quality assessments have also been conducted in tropical countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Helson1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>Most macroinvertebrate-based water quality assessment methods have been developed in temperate climate regions where relationships between environmental variables and the occurrence of macroinvertebrate taxa are well documented. Due to the infancy of the macroinvertebrate-based monitoring and assessment in the tropics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Dudgeon1">[12]</xref>, the ecological water quality in tropical countries was often assessed based on indices constructed for temperate climate regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Marques1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Thorne1">[14]</xref>. However, it has been shown that applying ecological indices and habitat suitability models from temperate regions to the tropics can lead to uncertain ecological valuations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Moya1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Tomanova1">[16]</xref>. In this perspective, river basin scale habitat suitability models have recently been developed for the tropics, e.g. in Ecuador <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-DominguezGranda1">[17]</xref>, Ethiopia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Ambelu1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Mereta1">[19]</xref> and Vietnam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Hoang1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Nguyen1">[21]</xref>. In spite of this progress, limited knowledge is available about the habitat preferences of macroinvertebrates in rivers in the tropics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-RosTouma1">[22]</xref>. For instance, it is poorly understood whether associations between macroinvertebrate taxa and environmental conditions vary between river basins and continents. As such, the question remains whether the relations obtained between the macroinvertebrate taxa and the physical-chemical water quality conditions are only valid in the river basin where they have been developed. Therefore, it is questioned whether the abiotic preferences of macroinvertebrates and their responses to environmental pollution are transferable across river basins.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to assess if abiotic preferences of aquatic macroinvertebrates differed between three river basins in the tropics. We investigated associations between physical-chemical variables and macroinvertebrate occurrences in one Ecuadorian, one Ethiopian and one Vietnamese river basin. Five representative macroinvertebrate taxa, ranging from pollution tolerant to pollution sensitive were selected and their preferences towards environmental conditions were compared using regression-based ecological models.</p>

<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Samples were taken in the Chaguana river basin (Ecuador), Gilgel Gibe river basin (Ethiopia) and Cau river basin (Vietnam) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t001">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s001">Figure S1</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s003">S3</xref>). In each survey physical-chemical water samples and biological samples (macroinvertebrates) were collected. Per river basin, samples were taken at multiple sampling sites along a pollution gradient (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t002">Table 2</xref>). Details on sampling locations are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s001">Figure S1</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s003">S3</xref>. The number of sampling sites varied for each river basin, but each sampling site was visited twice in each year; once in the wet season and once in the dry season. In total, 60, 104 and 306 samples were taken at 15, 29 and 47 sampling locations in the Vietnamese, Ecuadorian and Ethiopian river basin, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t002">Table 2</xref>). Water samples were analysed according to the ISO standards and only the environmental conditions that were monitored in all three river basins were selected for further analysis, being conductivity (¬µS.cm<sup>‚àí1</sup>), dissolved oxygen concentration (mg.L<sup>‚àí1</sup>), pH (-), stream velocity (m.s<sup>‚àí1</sup>) and water temperature (¬∞C) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled, identified and quantified according to the method described in Gabriels et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Gabriels1">[6]</xref> which is an internationally accepted kick-sampling procedure for macroinvertebrate sampling. A conical net with a size of 20√ó30 cm and a mesh size of 300‚Äì500 ¬µm, attached to a stick, was used. With the hand net, all accessible aquatic habitats within a stretch of 10‚Äì20 m were sampled using the kick sampling method. The sampling effort was equally divided over the different habitats per sampling site. The organisms were identified to family level and this resulted in binary presence-absence data. Subsequently, five macroinvertebrate families, present in the three river basins and ranging from a pollution tolerant family towards a pollution sensitive family based on the BMWP tolerance list, were selected. The five target macroinvertebrate families that were selected were Chironomidae (tolerance class 2 (TS2)), Baetidae (TS4), Hydroptilidae (TS6), Libellulidae (TS8) and Leptophlebiidae (TS10). For a complete overview of the taxa encountered in each river basin we refer to the related publications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-DominguezGranda1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Ambelu1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Hoang1">[20]</xref>. No specific permission was needed for our sampling activities nor locations since we were only interested in macroinvertebrates. Sampling did not involve endangered or protected species.</p>

<title>Data exploration</title>
<p>Boxplots were used for data exploration. The first series of boxplots visualized the seasonality of the physical-chemical variables per river basin. The second series of boxplots summarized for each macroinvertebrate family and per physical-chemical variable and river basin the conditions under which the taxon was present and absent. Boxplots were constructed with the R software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-R1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>The univariate associations between explanatory variables were assessed with pairwise Spearman's rank correlations, which is often used in ecology due to its nonparametric nature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Zuur1">[24]</xref>.</p>

<title>Logistic regression model</title>
<p>The occurrence of five macroinvertebrate families was related to the physical-chemical water quality conditions using a regression-based model and these relationships were compared between three river basins situated in the tropics. Logistic regression models (LRMs) were used to infer relationships between occurrences of five aquatic macroinvertebrate families and environmental data. LRMs have been frequently used to model the presence or absence of a species in relation to environmental variables <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Pearce1">[25]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-HolguinGonzalez1">[27]</xref>. Five logistic regression models (LRMs) were constructed, one for each macroinvertebrate family. In a LRM, a binary response variable (here family presence or absence) is modeled as a function of explanatory variables (here environmental conditions). Since multiple samples were collected on the same sampling site, the responses were not mutually independent. Therefore the LRMs were fitted with Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Liang1">[28]</xref>) which account for the dependencies of the clustered sampling scheme. All LRMs were fitted with an independent working correlation matrix.</p>
<p>A hierarchical backward elimination model selection method was carried out to build the LRM. The starting model included five physical-chemical variables (conductivity, dissolved oxygen concentration, pH, stream velocity and water temperature), season and river basin (represented as country). In addition to the main effects, two-way interactions between the physical-chemical variables and the river basin as well as between season and river basin were included (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s059">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s060">S2</xref>). First it was tested whether the interactions were present at a 5% level of significance and insignificant interactions were excluded from the model. A significant interaction between a physical-chemical variable and a river basin suggests that the effect of the physical-chemical variable on the occurrence of the family under study differed between river basins. Furthermore, all main effects were included independent from their significance.</p>
<p>Residual plots and the extended Hosmer-Lemeshow test for LRMs based on GEE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Horton1">[29]</xref> were used to assess the goodness-of-fit of the LRM. None of the models showed lack-of-fit. Since the Hosmer-Lemeshow test is insensitive to omitted quadratic terms, quadratic effects of the physical-chemical variables were added to the LRM. However, none of these effects were significant.</p>
<p>The outcome of the LRM per family was visualized as the estimated probability that the family was present as a function of a physical-chemical variable. The explanatory variables different from the one on the x-axis, were set to their river basin specific medians and the season to ‚Äúdry‚Äù. The river basin-specific observed range of the corresponding physical-chemical variable were plotted as horizontal boxplots below the response curves and were subdivided between presence and absence points. The gray-colored ends of the response curves indicate extrapolation outside the observed range of the corresponding physical-chemical variable.</p>
<p>For the data exploration, the effects of season and river basin on the continuous physical-chemical variables were assessed using a linear regression model fitted with GEE for accounting for the clustered sampling scheme. Only few p-values were reported in the main text to prevent information overload, all p-values were summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t003">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t004">4</xref>. All statistical tests were performed at the 5% significance level.</p>

<title>Data exploration and correlation analysis</title>
<p>The observed range of physical-chemical water quality conditions was not always equal between river basins. Seasonal effects were observed for all physical-chemical variables and the seasonal effect of conductivity and stream velocity was similar for the three river basins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s059">Table S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s004">Figure S4</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s008">S8</xref>). Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration and water temperature ranges differed between river basins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t002">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s009">Figure S9</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s033">S33</xref>). The average stream velocity was higher during the wet season compared to the dry season (p&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s059">Table S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s004">Figure S4</xref>). The average conductivity in wet season was lower than in dry season in the Ecuadorian river basin (p&lt;0.01) and the Ethiopian river basin (p&lt;0.01). In the Vietnamese river basin, however, this difference was not significant (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.39; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s006">Figure S6</xref>). The seasonal effect differed per river basin for water temperature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s005">Figure S5</xref>), pH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s007">Figure S7</xref>) and DO concentration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s008">Figure S8</xref>). For instance, dry season DO concentrations tended to exceed wet season conditions in the Ecuadorian river basin, but in the Ethiopian river basin the opposite was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s059">Table S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s008">Figure S8</xref>). For both seasons there was no significant difference in mean stream velocity between river basins (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.32 and p‚Ää=‚Ää0.78, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s060">Table S2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s004">Figure S4</xref>). For DO there was a significant difference between river basins for the dry season (p&lt;0.01), but not for the wet season (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.16). In contrast, the mean water temperature, pH and conductivity were significantly different across river basins for both seasons.</p>
<p>The prevalence values, known as the relative frequencies of occurrence of taxa (here families, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Mouton1">[30]</xref>), did not always approximate 0.5, i.e. some families occurred rarely or ubiquitously (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t002">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, it was found that the range of preferred physical-chemical conditions differed between families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108898-g001">Figure 1A‚Äì1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108898-g002">Figure 2A‚Äì2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s009">Figure S9</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s033">S33</xref>). For less pollution sensitive families such as Chironomidae (TS2) and Baetidae (TS4) a wide range of suitable physical-chemical conditions has been observed. More sensitive families such as Leptophlebiidae (TS10) were only present within a more narrow range of stream velocity, conductivity and DO concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108898-g001">Figure 1A‚Äì1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108898-g002">Figure 2A‚Äì2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s009">Figure S9</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s033">S33</xref>).</p>

<title>Chironomidae (TS2)</title>
<p>For Chironomidae there was an interaction effect between river basin and water temperature (p&lt;0.01), i.e. the effect of water temperature on the occurrence differed between river basins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t003">Table 3</xref>). Although increasing water temperatures were associated with a lower probability that Chironomidae were present in the Vietnamese river basin (p&lt;0.01), in the Ecuadorian river basin and in the Ethiopian river basin this effect was not observed (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.46 and p‚Ää=‚Ää0.15, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t004">Table 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s035">Figure S35</xref>). However, note that Chironomidae were absent in only 4 out of 60 samples from the Vietnamese river basin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s035">Figure S35</xref>). We also found a positive association between the stream velocity and the probability of occurrence of Chironomidae (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.02), i.e. a higher stream velocity was associated with a higher probability that Chironomidae were present (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t004">Table 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108898-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The effect of stream velocity was similar between river basins, i.e. regardless the stream velocity, Chironomidae were always likely to be present in the three river basins (probabilities between 0.8 and 1.0 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108898-g003">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s034">S34</xref>). The latter is also reflected in the boxplots, which indicate that absence data for Chironomidae is low (4 out of 60 in Vietnam, 49 out of 306 in Ethiopia and 9 out of 104 in Ecuador; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108898-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Within the investigated physical-chemical range, conductivity, pH, and DO concentrations were not associated with the probability of occurrence of Chironomidae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108898-g003">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s036">Figure S36</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s038">S38</xref>).</p>

<title>Baetidae (TS4)</title>
<p>The effect of water temperature on the probability of occurrence of Baetidae differed between river basins (p&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t003">Table 3</xref>). Indeed, when looking at the response curves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s040">Figure S40</xref>) it is clear that within the observed water temperature ranges for each river basin, the slopes of the curves differ. However, probabilities of occurrence always exceeded the value of 0.6 in any river basin regardless the water temperature data. Moreover, within river basins no significant association was found between the presence of Baetidae and water temperature (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t004">Table 4</xref>). An increased stream velocity and pH was associated with an increased probability of occurrence of Baetidae in all three river basins (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.01 and p‚Ää=‚Ää0.03, respectively; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t004">Table 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s039">Figure S39</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s042">S42</xref>). Again, similar as for the Chironomidae, we found that Baetidae were likely to be present in all the three river basins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108898-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s039">S39</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s042">S42</xref>). In the investigated range, no significant association was found between the probability of occurrence of Baetidae and DO concentration (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.58, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s043">Figure S43</xref>) or conductivity (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.11, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s041">Figure S41</xref>).</p>

<title>Hydroptilidae (TS6)</title>
<p>Associations between the DO concentration, pH, stream velocity and water temperature relative to the probability of occurrence of Hydroptilidae were similar across river basins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t003">Table 3</xref>). Only the effect of conductivity differed between river basins (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.02; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t004">Table 4</xref>), i.e. higher conductivities were associated with a lower probability that Hydroptilidae were present; this was observed for the Vietnamese river basin (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.03) and the Ethiopian river basin (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.04; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t004">Table 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s046">Figure S46</xref>). Furthermore, a more alkaline pH was associated with a higher occurrence of Hydroptilidae (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.02; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t004">Table 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s047">Figure S47</xref>). No significant associations were found between water temperature (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.69; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s045">Figure S45</xref>), stream velocity (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.90; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s044">Figure S44</xref>) and DO concentration (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.26; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s048">Figure S48</xref>) and the probability of occurrence of Hydroptilidae (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t004">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Libellulidae (TS8)</title>
<p>The associations between water temperature (p&lt;0.01), stream velocity (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.02) and DO concentration (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.02) and the probability of occurrence of Libellulidae differed between river basins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t003">Table 3</xref>). Whereas in the Ecuadorian river basin, the probability that Libellulidae occurred increased with increasing water temperatures (p&lt;0.01), in the Ethiopian and Vietnamese river basin inverse associations were observed (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.02 and p&lt;0.01, respectively; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t004">Table 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s050">Figure S50</xref>). Concerning stream velocity, Libellulidae were likely to occur at higher stream velocities in the Ecuadorian and Vietnamese river basin (p&lt;0.01 and p‚Ää=‚Ää0.02, respectively), but in the Ethiopian river basin this was not observed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t004">Table 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108898-g004">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s049">S49</xref>). Increasing DO concentrations were associated with a higher probability of occurrence of Libellulidae in the Ecuadorian river basin (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.02), but for the Vietnamese (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.82) and Ethiopian river basin (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.62) this association was not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108898-g004">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s053">S53</xref>).

In the Vietnamese and Ethiopian river basin, however, these effects were not observed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t004">Table 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108898-g005">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s054">S54</xref>), probably due the limited amount of presence data in these river basins. The association between conductivity and the probability of occurrence of Leptophlebiidae suggested the highest probability of occurrence at lowest conductivities in the Vietnamese river basin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s056">Figure S56</xref>). For all three river basins, an increase in DO concentration was positively associated with the occurrence of Leptophlebiidae (p&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t004">Table 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108898-g005">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s058">S58</xref>). Associations between Leptophlebiidae and water temperature were similar between the three river basins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s055">Figure S55</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>For pollution tolerant macroinvertebrate families (e.g. Chironomidae (TS2)) only few significant associations between physical-chemical conditions and the occurrence of the families were found (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t004">Table 4</xref>) suggesting their occurrence at a wide range of physical-chemical conditions. This was also reflected in the data exploration as Chironomidae were present in 91%, 84% and 93% of the samples taken in the Ecuadorian, Ethiopian and Vietnamese river basin, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t002">Table 2</xref>). Chironomidae are known to be tolerant to disturbance, allowing them to occur in impacted environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Mereta2">[32]</xref>. Due to their physiological adaptations they have the ability to survive low oxygen conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108898-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108898-g003">3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Armitage2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Connolly1">[34]</xref>). Because of their pollution tolerant nature, it was surprising to conclude that high stream velocities are associated with an increased occurrence of Chironomidae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108898-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108898-g003">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s034">S34</xref>). However, in this study we only identified macroinvertebrates to family level. Chironomidae are represented by many species that show a different sensitivity to environmental pollution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Armitage2">[33]</xref>, which might explain the weak association between environmental variables and the occurrence of Chironomidae. Baetidae, present in 83%, 74% and 82% of the samples taken in the Ecuadorian, Ethiopian and Vietnamese river basin, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t002">Table 2</xref>), were more sensitive to pollution compared to Chironomidae. The habitat preference of Baetidae was mainly determined by stream velocity and pH. Baetidae have often been reported as one of the most acid-sensitive macroinvertebrate families <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Tixier1">[35]</xref>. As taxa sensitivity to pollution increased, more significant associations were found between environmental conditions and the occurrence of macroinvertebrate families (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t004">Table 4</xref>). For instance, a significant positive association between DO concentrations and stream velocities and the occurrence of Libellulidae (TS8) and Leptophlebiidae (TS10) was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108898-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108898-g005">5</xref>). DO concentration is a general indicator of water quality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Connolly1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Hynes1">[36]</xref> and also in other studies it was found that DO concentrations play a crucial role when analyzing the occurrence of macroinvertebrates (e.g., [37‚Äì39)]. In streams in Malaysia, Rawi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Rawi1">[40]</xref> found that DO concentration and stream velocity were crucial variables when explaining macroinvertebrate diversity. For other biological communities DO levels are also important, e.g. most fish require a DO concentration of at least 5 mg.L<sup>‚àí1</sup> for optimal health <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Chapman2">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>Habitat suitability of macro-invertebrates probably depends on more factors than those included in our statistical analysis. For instance, additional to the variables that were included in our analysis, Al-Shami et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-AlShami1">[42]</xref> also integrated geographical variables such as longitude, latitude and altitude. Blanchette and Pearson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Blanchette1">[43]</xref> related macroinvertebrate assemblages to chlorophyll, suspended solids, turbidity and nutrient data. Kasangaki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Kasangaki1">[44]</xref> studied benthic macroinvertebrates in Uganda and used DO concentration, conductivity, pH, turbidity and water temperature together with some hydromorphological stream characteristics. As such, physical-chemical variables used by Kasangaki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Kasangaki1">[44]</xref> are similar to those included in our statistical analysis. Conductivity can be seen as a general measure for disturbance as it integrates pollution related variables like minerals and inorganic pollutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-DHeygere1">[37]</xref>. For instance, Melo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Melo1">[45]</xref> concluded that stream size data and conductivity explained most of the variability in the macroinvertebrate community in a stream in the tropics. In Colombia, Holguin-Gonzalez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Rushton1">[26]</xref> used DO concentration and stream velocity to predict the presence of macroinvertebrates. According to Flecker and Feifarek <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Flecker1">[46]</xref> hydrodynamics (including stream velocity) play a crucial role in structuring tropic macroinvertebrate communities. Therefore, although only five physical-chemical variables were used in the models, explanatory variables embedded in the LRMs covered a wide spectrum of potential impacts.</p>
<p>Seasonal changes of environmental variables were taken into account <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Couceiro1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Blanchette1">[43]</xref>. Two samples in each year and at each sampling location (in the wet and dry season) were collected for two consecutive years for each river basin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s059">Table S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s004">Figure S4</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s008">S8</xref>). By including these, potential seasonal uncertainties were integrated in our statistical analysis.</p>
<p>The outcome of the LRM per family was visualized as the estimated probability that the family was present as a function of a physical-chemical variable (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108898-g003">Figure 3</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108898-g005">5</xref>). Within the physical-chemical ranges that were investigated and for the studied macroinvertebrate families (see boxplots and colored zone of the response curves), nine out of twenty-five interaction effects were significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t003">Table 3</xref>). Hence, the corresponding variable-macroinvertebrate relationships were different between river basins and suggested different habitat preferences for the investigated families. For Libellulidae for instance, it was found that the effect of dissolved oxygen was different between river basins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t003">Table 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108898-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Increasing DO concentrations were associated with a higher probability that Libellulidae were present in Ecuadorian river basin (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.02), but in the Vietnamese and Ethiopian river basin this relationship was not significant (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.82 and p‚Ää=‚Ää0.62). In the Vietnamese and Ethiopian river basin, Libellulidae were less responsive to shifts in DO concentrations as the probability of occurrence hardly changed at varying DO concentrations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t004">Table 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108898-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). In the Vietnamese river basin, this can be explained by the relative few observed presences of some taxa, i.e. Libellulidae were found in only nine out of sixty samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t002">Table 2</xref>). In the Ethiopian river basin however, presence and absence data were more equally represented. Concerning the association between stream velocity and the occurrence of Libellulidae it was found that Libellulidae favored high currents in the Ecuadorian and Vietnamese river basin (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.01 and p‚Ää=‚Ää0.02, respectively). In the Ethiopian river basin, this relationship was not observed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t004">Table 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108898-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). However, a negative relationship did not mean that Libellulidae were absent in the Ethiopian river basin as there was still an estimated probability of 50% that Libellulidae were present within the range of observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108898-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).</p>
<p>The fact that river basin dependent associations were found is not surprising. For instance, Bonada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Bonada1">[47]</xref> found that the response of macroinvertebrates to pollution was different between Mediterranean ecoregions. Also in the US, Zuellig and Schmidt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Zuellig1">[48]</xref> found dissimilar regional benthic invertebrate community compositions. Moreover, it was stated by Thorne and Williams <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Marques1">[13]</xref> that due to untreated domestic and urban effluents in developing countries the relationship between individual physical-chemical variables and macroinvertebrates present can be extremely complex. Hence, this may lead to river basin specific associations between abiotic conditions and the biological communities.</p>
<p>Since the range of the observed physical-chemical conditions were not always equal between river basins, in some cases extrapolations outside the observed range were shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108898-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). For instance, water temperature measurements significantly differed between the three river basins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s060">Table S2</xref>). Hence, it was found that the association between the occurrence of Libellulidae and water temperature was significantly different between river basins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108898-t003">Table 3</xref>). However, at the intersection of the three ranges, the estimated probabilities were similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108898.s050">Figure S50</xref>). Therefore, major differences in the estimated probabilities across river basins are likely to be attributed to difference in the range of the water temperature between those basins.</p>
<p>No relation was found between the occurrence of Leptophlebiidae and stream velocity in the Ethiopian and the Vietnamese river basin. However, according to the data Leptophlebiidae occurred in both river basins in upstream sampling sites with a moderate to high stream velocity. The reason for the non-significant relation is the prevalence of the present-points. In the Vietnamese and Ethiopian river basin, Leptophlebiidae were only present in 18% and 2% of the samples, respectively. Consequently, the occurrence of Leptophlebiidae seems statistically not associated with stream velocity. Therefore, due to unbalanced dataset prevalence it is possible that not all models obtained represent true ecological relations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Mouton1">[30]</xref>. As such, LRMs' outcomes should be carefully interpreted, but for those families and river basins where prevalence was in balance, the associations found, were ecologically relevant.</p>
<p>Presence and absence data are commonly used in macroinvertebrate research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Zuellig1">[48]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Everaert2">[51]</xref>) as they provide a basic inventory to explore the species' ecology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Pearce2">[52]</xref>. However, recently Howard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Howard1">[53]</xref> concluded that using abundance data instead of presence and absence data could make models more informative since abundance data provide additional insight with regard to the population dynamics. Although it may result in a gain of information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Fukuda1">[54]</xref>, including abundance data will also increase the variability of the response variable. In this perspective, Flecker and Feifarek <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Flecker1">[46]</xref> concluded that the abundance of macroinvertebrate families differed seasonally between one and four orders of magnitude. In this research the sample size (60‚Äì306) was relatively limited compared to the number of sampling locations (15‚Äì47) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Vaughan1">[55]</xref> and may not cover the entire seasonality in the macroinvertebrate abundance data. Therefore, it was more appropriate to analyze presence-absence data, which are more robust against seasonal changes. Moreover, logistic models have been frequently applied (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Zuur1">[24]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Rushton1">[26]</xref>) as they are well suited to provide predictions of the probability of occurrence based on presence and absence data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Pearce2">[52]</xref>.</p>
<p>As an alternative to the conventional taxonomic division of the benthic invertebrates one can use functional traits to categorize macroinvertebrate assemblages (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Zuellig1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Boets1">[56]</xref>). Such a trait-based approach is a promising alternative to taxonomy-based approaches for assessing the conditions of freshwater ecosystems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Menezes1">[57]</xref>. However, trait-based studies have often a limited scope and further testing is needed to establish their reliability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108898-Zuellig1">[48]</xref>, especially in regions where knowledge on macroinvertebrates is poor.</p>
<p>Overall, LRMs based on GEE are a flexible way to model the probability of occurrence of macroinvertebrates as a function of environmental variables. We revealed similar as well as dissimilar abiotic preferences of macroinvertebrates between the three river basins, but these estimated probabilities are restricted to the observed range of the predictor within each river basin. In conclusion we found that associations between macroinvertebrates and abiotic conditions can be river basin-specific.</p>
