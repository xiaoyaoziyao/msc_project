          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Metastasis, the spread and growth of tumor cells to distant organ sites, represents the most devastating attribute and plays a major role in the morbidity and mortality of cancer. Inflammation is crucial for malignant tumor transformation and survival. Thus, blocking inflammation is expected to serve as an effective cancer treatment. Among anti-inflammation therapies, chemokine modulation is now beginning to emerge from the pipeline. CXC chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) and its ligand stromal cell-derived factor-1 (CXCL12) interaction and the resulting cell signaling cascade have emerged as highly relevant targets since they play pleiotropic roles in metastatic progression. The unique function of CXCR4 is to promote the homing of tumor cells to their microenvironment at the distant organ sites.</p>

          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>We describe the actions of N,N′-(1,4-phenylenebis(methylene))dipyrimidin-2-amine (designated MSX-122), a novel small molecule and partial CXCR4 antagonist with properties quite unlike that of any other reported CXCR4 antagonists, which was prepared in a single chemical step using a reductive amination reaction. Its specificity toward CXCR4 was tested in a binding affinity assay and a ligand competition assay using <sup>18</sup>F-labeled MSX-122. The potency of the compound was determined in two functional assays, Matrigel invasion assay and cAMP modulation. The therapeutic potential of MSX-122 was evaluated in three different murine models for inflammation including an experimental colitis, carrageenan induced paw edema, and bleomycin induced lung fibrosis and three different animal models for metastasis including breast cancer micrometastasis in lung, head and neck cancer metastasis in lung, and uveal melanoma micrometastasis in liver in which CXCR4 was reported to play crucial roles.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
          <p>We developed a novel small molecule, MSX-122, that is a partial CXCR4 antagonist without mobilizing stem cells, which can be safer for long-term blockade of metastasis than other reported CXCR4 antagonists.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Chemokines are small, pro-inflammatory cytokines of approximately 10 kDa that orchestrate a diverse set of activities through interaction with their cognate receptors. Coupling of stromal cell derived factor 1 (SDF-1; CXCL12) with its receptor CXCR4, which was previously identified as a major coreceptor for the entry of T-tropic HIV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Davis1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Feng1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Sanchez1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Zaitseva1">[4]</xref>, plays critical roles in inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Calandra1">[5]</xref>, as well as cancer metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Zlotnik1">[6]</xref>. The invasion of cancer cells into surrounding tissue is associated with considerable destruction and regeneration of intercellular elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Liotta1">[7]</xref>. Newly synthesized stroma, known as “cancer-induced stroma,” is composed of inflammatory cells (including lymphocytes, granulocytes, and macrophages), endothelial cells of blood and lymph vessels, pericytes, and fibroblasts. Solid tumors are often infiltrated with leukocytes and macrophages. In some tumors, leukocytes can account for up to 50% of the tumor mass, the most represented subsets being lymphocytes and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). The presence of TAM at the tumor site represents one of the hallmarks of cancer associated inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Porta1">[8]</xref>. TAMs derive from circulating monocytes that are selectively attracted within the tumor microenvironment by locally produced chemotactic factors, such as CXCL12. Incoming monocytes differentiate in the tumor microenvironment to tissue resident macrophages. In turn, several TAM products have been shown to directly stimulate the growth of tumor cells. Additionally, TAMs also contribute to the angiogenic switch by releasing angiogenic factors (VEGF, FGF, and CXCL12) and to the degradation and remodeling of the matrix with metalloproteases (MMPs), suggesting an important role in neovascular formation and subsequent tumor progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Lazennec1">[9]</xref>. In addition, the CXCR4/CXCL12-axis has been shown to play a pivotal role in trafficking and homing of normal stem cells and metastasis of cancer stem cells to organs that express high levels of CXCL12, such as the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, and bone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Kucia1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Furusato1">[11]</xref>. Homing, the mechanism that allows foreign tissue-origin cells to reside and proliferate, is believed to be the rate-limiting step of the multi-step metastatic process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Weinberg1">[12]</xref>. Kang et al. generated an animal model of bone metastasis by the intercardiac injection of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells into female SCID mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Kang1">[13]</xref>. A subsequent microarray analysis on a sub-population of MDA-MB-231 cells with elevated metastatic activity isolated from the mouse showed that one of the six genes responsible for the metastatic phenotype was CXCR4, which was responsible for homing of breast tissue-origin tumor cells to bone. In samples collected from various breast cancer patients, Muller <italic>et al</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Muller1">[14]</xref> found that the level of expression of CXCR4 is higher in primary tumors relative to normal mammary glands or mammary epithelial cells. By contrast, CXCL12 is highly expressed in the most common destinations of breast cancer metastasis including the lymph nodes, lung, liver, and bone marrow. Taken together, CXCR4 and CXCL12 may indeed play critical roles in breast cancer metastasis. Thus, it is important to develop anti-CXCR4 compounds that can intervene in this interaction. The expression of CXCR4 has been detected in 23 different types of cancers, making it the most common chemokine receptor expressed on cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Balkwill1">[15]</xref>. There is a significant volume of literature demonstrating that CXCR4 and CXCL12 play critical roles in cancer metastasis in numerous types of cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Shim1">[16]</xref> and it is important to develop anti-CXCR4 compounds to intervene in this progression.</p>
      <p>The current clinical lead compound, AMD3100, is a metal-chelating bicyclam that has been shown to block calcium flux induced by CXCR4 activation. Its chelating properties are likely related to the cardiotoxicity reported in its clinical trial against HIV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-DeClercq1">[17]</xref>. AMD3100 was recently approved by the FDA for stem cell mobilization. While AMD3100 can benefit patients with certain diseases, it can also induce lung or liver fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Strieter1">[18]</xref>, and the mobilized cells may act as potential cancer stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Schiffer1">[19]</xref>. Therefore, while limited single use of AMD3100 is widely accepted, drugs with improved toxicity profiles will be required for long term clinical use. We had previously reported that blocking the CXCR4/CXCL12 interaction with a peptidic CXCR4 antagonist, TN14003, suppresses lung metastasis in models of breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Liang1">[20]</xref> and head and neck cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Yoon1">[21]</xref>. In addition, we reported that TN14003 blocks bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Xu1">[22]</xref>. Although the TN14003 results provided an important proof of concept, its lack of oral availability promted us to look for alternatives that possessed better phamacologic profiles. Using TN14003 as our benchmark, we herein report the development of a novel, small molecule CXCR4 modulator, MSX-122, that specifically blocks selected functions of CXCR4.</p>
      <p>Since a large patient population can benefit from anti-metastasis treatment, our drug could potentially have a significant impact on human health.</p>

        <p>Initially, we proposed that inclusion of a nitrogen atom in each of the terminal aromatic rings (i.e., pyridyl instead of phenyl) might impede rapid oxidative metabolism and improve inhibitor pharmacokinetic profiles. This working hypothesis was validated in our previously reported structure-activity relationship (SAR) study that led to discovery of WZ811 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Zhan1">[23]</xref>. A second nitrogen atom substitution in the terminal aromatic rings (i.e., pyrimidyl), which was designated as MSX-122, further improved the pharmacokinetic profile. This compound was prepared in a single chemical step using a reductive amination reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034038-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-AbdelMagid1">[24]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Screening for Anti-CXCR4 Small Molecules via Selected <italic>in vitro</italic> Assays</title>
        <p>For primary compound screening, the previously reported binding affinity assay was utilized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Zhan1">[23]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034038-g001"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>).

Effective concentration for MSX-122 was at a low nanomolar (the concentration at which each compound blocks more than 50% of TN14003 binding on CXCR4).</p>
        <p>MSX-122 cannot block <sup>125</sup>I-labeled full length CXCL12 binding to CXCR4 (data not shown), while the reports about AMD3100 are controversial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Gupta1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Fricker1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Kalatskaya1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Kofuku1">[30]</xref>. This may be due to the fact that CXCL12, a 10 kDa peptide, has multiple interaction sites on CXCR4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Gupta1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Crump1">[31]</xref>. However, we anticipated that CXCL12 would block MSX-122 binding to CXCR4 because MSX-122 binds to a CXCL12 binding site on CXCR4. To determine whether MSX-122 directly binds to the CXCL12 site on CXCR4, we utilized highly sensitive radiotracer technique, using a fluorine-18 radiolabeled MSX-122 analog (MSX-122F) in which one pyrimidine ring of MSX-122 was labeled by fluorine-18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034038-g001"><bold>Figure 1D</bold></xref>). Then, we tested whether preincubation with CXCL12 before adding [<sup>18</sup>F]MSX-122F blocked binding to CXCR4 in the CXCR4-positive metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN) cells that we established from a poorly metastatic parental cell line by four rounds of <italic>in vivo</italic> selection using a lymph node metastatic xenograft mouse model.

        <title>CXCR4/MSX-122 Docking Model</title>
        <p>The published crystallographic structure of CXCR4, bound by the small molecule antagonist IT1t (2.5 Å resolution; PDB code: 3ODU) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Wu1">[33]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034038.s003">Data S2</xref>), has been utilized to explore the interaction of MSX-122 with CXCR4 and in comparison to IT1t, a CXCR4 antagonist. Thus, IT1t was removed from the complex, and the flexible ligand Glide docking methodology with extra precision <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Friesner1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Halgren1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Sherman1">[36]</xref> was employed to predict binding poses for MSX-122 in the binding site of 3ODU/CXCR4. The resulting binding poses were subsequently sorted by energy with the MM-GBSA scoring algorithm, which provides an estimate of relative binding free energies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Graves1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Guimaraes1">[38]</xref>. A predicted binding pose of low energy is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034038-g001"><bold>Figure 1E</bold></xref>. MSX-122 (magenta) resides in close proximity to the binding locale occupied by a TN14003 analog in the rather spacious pocket. The docking result is consistent with Gupta’s speculation that small molecule antagonists can inhibit functional signal transduction without displacement of CXCL12 because CXCL12 interacts via multiple sites, one being the N-terminal segment of CXCR4 at the receptor surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Gupta1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Crump1">[31]</xref>. Thus, it is not unreasonable to postulate that a large molecule such as TN14003 can displace CXCL12 binding to CXCR4, while MSX-122 near the bottom of the binding pocket cannot. Nonetheless, we postulate that MSX-122 bound to CXCR4 can interfere with the “lock and key” mechanism between CXCR4 and CXCL12, which can result in inhibiting key functional signaling such as Matrigel invasion and cAMP modulation without displacing CXCL12.</p>

        <p>For secondary screening assays, we utilized three functional assays that use the full-length CXCL12 ligand.

CXCR4 and CXCL12 are also known to play critical roles in endothelial cell migration and tubular organization. While AMD3100 at 100 nM blocked 43% of CXCL12-induced tubular network formation, MSX-122 blocked 63% at the same concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034038-g002"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>).</p>

        <p>Lastly, we utilized a cAMP assay as a secondary functional assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Zhan1">[23]</xref>. As a GPCR, CXCR4 binds CXCL12 and activates G-protein mediated signaling through the Gα<sub>i</sub> pathway that reduces cAMP levels within cells. While MSX-122 counteracted CXCL12 function effectively at concentrations as low as 10 nM, 1000 nM AMD3100 was required to significantly block CXCL12 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034038-g003"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>). We also determined whether CXCL12 alters cAMP levels in CXCR4-negative (wild-type) vs. CXCR4-transfected MDA-MB-435 cells to ensure that the cAMP changes in this assay are CXCR4-specific. It is noteworthy that neither MDA-MB-435 cells nor CXCR4-transfected MDA-MB-435 cells express CXCR7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034038-g003"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>).

MSX-122 was also tested against other chemokine receptors (e.g., CCR3 and CCR5) for cross-reactivity, but it did not block cAMP reduction mediated by their corresponding ligands CCR3/CCL5 and CCR5/CCL5 (data not shown).</p>

          <p>Consistent with the histological differences, a marked decrease in neutrophil infiltration into the injured tissue (as assessed by myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Castaneda1">[41]</xref>) was observed in DSS/MSX-122 treated mice when compared with DSS treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034038-g004"><bold>Figure 4C</bold></xref>). To elucidate whether MSX-122 action inhibits T-lymphocyte infiltration in colonic mucosa, we determined the number of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells by immunohistochemical analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Andres1">[42]</xref> and found it to be markedly decreased in DSS/MSX-122-treated mice relative to DSS-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034038-g004"><bold>Figure 4D</bold></xref>). These data clearly demonstrate that inflammation was far less severe in MSX-122-treated <italic>vs.</italic> DSS-treated mice.</p>
          <p>Since inflammatory cells, including lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages, express CXCR4, we wanted to determine whether MSX-122 blocks accumulation of such cells in the mucosa. DSS-treatment for 7 days significantly increased the number of CXCR4-positive cells at the sites of ulceration, which remained elevated at day 10. By comparison, the number of CXCR4-positive cells was markedly decreased in DSS/MSX122 treated animals relative to the DSS-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034038-g004"><bold>Figures 4E, F</bold></xref>). These data show that MSX-122 blocks infiltration of CXCR4-positive cells in the mucosa.</p>
          <p>Since cytokines play a central role as mediators of inflammation, we next sought to determine the role of CXCR4 in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the colon of mice by real-time RT-PCR. In DSS-treated mice, drastic increases in the mRNA levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines were observed. MSX-122 attenuated the production of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 at day 7, and further decreased cytokine concentration at day 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034038-g004"><bold>Figure 4G</bold></xref>). INF-γ mRNA expression was slightly reduced by MSX-122 treatment, but did not reach a statistical difference compared with DSS-treated mice (data not shown). As a consequence, we conclude that the inhibtion of CXCR4 alters the cytokine profiles within the mucosa of DSS-treated mice.</p>
          <p>There is substantial evidence that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially Crohn’s disease (CD), is associated with invasive <italic>E.coli</italic>, which regulates cytokine expression and epithelial barrier function within the host environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Sasaki1">[43]</xref>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Metastasis is an end result for many solid tumor types and is the leading cause of cancer related deaths. This process involves intimate cooperation between tumor cells and their tumor microenvironment for homing and recruitment of tumor cells as well as tumor stroma components. Ironically, as of now, there are no marketed therapies that specifically target and address the metastatic process. As such, it has attracted an increasing amount of attention from research groups over the last decade in both academia and industry, as a target for disease intervention and life extension. The CXCR4/CXCL12 interaction, and the resulting cell signaling cascade, has recently emerged as one of the most relevant such targets as it has been shown to play a key role in metastatic progression. We have been simultaneously designing and generating new analogs to optimize their efficacy as well as expand our structural scope <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Zhan1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Zhu1">[45]</xref>. MSX-122 is currently our most advanced lead, which potently binds to CXCR4, thus, blocking certain functions of CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling. We have followed this discovery by demonstrating that MSX-122 inhibits tumor metastasis and inflammation in numerous <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. Specific screening assays that have been established for the selection process include <italic>in vitro</italic> binding potency, ligand competition, Matrigel invasion, and cAMP modulation, and CXCR4/MSX-122 docking modeling. We have also established and validated a number of <italic>in vivo</italic> models of cancer metastasis and inflammation that have been utilized here to establish a proof of efficacy for our lead molecule. The intended outcome of current work was the development of a unique small molecule that will effectively attenuate cancer metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic> by blocking CXCR4 function whilst demonstrating a specificity profile to merit advancement into human clinical evaluation.</p>
      <p>The anti-inflammatory efficacy of MSX-122 has been tested in three animal models in which inhibition of CXCR4 is reported to ameliorate the severity of disease progression. We observed that DSS/MSX-122-treated mice had shown only moderate signs of inflammation compared to DSS-treated mice. In addition, we demonstrated that MSX-122 blocks bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis involving chemotaxis and homing of CXCR4-positive mesenchymal progenitor cells into the lungs, the same critical mechanisms involved in cancer metastasis. Furthermore, MSX-122 exhibits anti-inflammatory activity in a carrageenan-induced paw edema model. Consistent with the effect of other known CXCR4 antagonists, MSX-122 blocks lung metastasis of breast cancer and SCCHN, and liver metastasis of uveal melanoma <italic>in vivo</italic>. These data further support the role of CXCR4 in chemotaxis, motility, and invasion and reinforce its value as a target for therapeutic intervention in disease states where these phenomena play key roles, such as inflammation and cancer metastasis.</p>
      <p>A most intriguing aspect of MSX-122 is that it behaves differently from other reported anti-CXCR4 compounds, especially AMD3100. MSX-122 is not effective in blocking T-tropic HIV infections as determined by studies carried out at Monogram Biosciences (data not shown). MSX-122 is also incapable of blocking the binding of <sup>125</sup>I-labeled CXCL12 to CXCR4. Consistent with previous reports of multiple interaction sites between CXCR4 and CXCL12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Gupta1">[27]</xref>, MSX-122 (molecular weight &lt;300 daltons) appears to be insufficiently large to block all binding sites between CXCR4 and CXCL12. However, we anticipated that CXCL12 would block MSX-122 binding to CXCR4 because MSX-122 binds to a CXCL12 binding site on CXCR4. To test this hypothesis, we labeled MSX-122 with fluorine-18 and tested whether preincubation with CXCL12 before adding [<sup>18</sup>F]MSX-122F blocked binding to CXCR4 in the CXCR4-positive metastatic SCCHN cells. As predicted, CXCL12 blocked binding of [<sup>18</sup>F]MSX-122F to CXCR4. This strongly supports that MSX-122 blocks certain CXCR4 functions via binding to the CXCL12-binding site and interfering with CXCR4/CXCL12-mediated signaling.</p>
      <p>Like our previous anti-CXCR4 compounds, MSX-122 can intervene in the Gα<sub>i</sub>-signaling pathway (cAMP modulation), but not the Gq-pathway (calcium flux) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Dorsam1">[48]</xref>. This limited functionality of MSX-122 as a CXCR4 inhibitor may represent a significant safety asset, since the CXCL12/CXCR4-axis is critical to normal physiology. In the normal adult, the CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling is involved in the homing and retention of hematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow. These progenitor cells express high levels of CXCR4, and are attracted to CXCL12 produced by stromal cells in specialized bone marrow niches. In addition, CXCL12 acts as a major chemoattractant for stem cells and some differentiated cells in the pathological contexts of tissue regeneration/repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Gao1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Imitola1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Kajiyama1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Moyer1">[52]</xref>. Therefore, our functionally circumscribed CXCR4 inhibitor, which blocks chemotaxis and homing of the CXCR4-positive cells to distant organ sites when enriched with CXCL12 in the stroma without disturbing the retention of hematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow, presages a unique therapeutic application of MSX-122 for cancer metastasis or inflammation.</p>
      <p>In summary, the novel small molecule, MSX-122, identified by rational design and analysis of emerging structural and pharmacologic data, is a partial inhibitor of CXCR4/CXCL12 functions. The compelling features of the MSX-122 profile include: (i) potent inhibition of CXCR4/CXCL12 actions (IC<sub>50</sub>∼10 nM); (ii) ease of production on a large scale; (iii) effectiveness as an anti-inflammatory and anti-metastatic agent <italic>in vivo</italic>; and (iv) unique property of blocking homing and recruitment without mobilizing stem cells.</p>

On day 28, hepatic tissues were collected and fixed in 10% formalin, processed, H&amp;E stained, and the number of hepatic micrometastases was counted under microscope. Six sections through the center of the liver were microscopically examined (Olympus BX41, Tokyo, Japan) for the presence of micrometastases (&lt;100 µm diameter) and the average number of micrometastases per section was determined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Zhu1">[45]</xref>. Ten mice per group were used. A table summarizing animal experiments for three metastasis models can be found in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034038.s004">Data S3</xref>.</p>
        <p>All the animals were housed in the Emory animal facility. All protocols for animal studies were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Emory University ( IACUC protocol numbers:170-2008, 155-2007, 029-2008, and 065-2006). Emory DAR (Division of Animal Resources) has experienced clinical veterinary and animal caretaker support staff who are well trained in the care of rodents. All animals were monitored daily by the investigators and by members of the clinical veterinary staff concerning general health and to detect signs of discomfort. Any animal showing signs of discomfort, pain or distress was sacrificed immediately following IACUC guideline for endpoints. All reasonable measures were taken to ensure the health and well being of the animals during the course of the study. The procedures to be used for animal care were consistent with those established by the NIH and the vivarium was fully accredited by the AAALAC. All experimental results adhere to the ARRIVE guidelines for the reporting of animal research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034038-Kilkenny1">[55]</xref>.</p>
