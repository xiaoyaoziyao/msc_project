<abstract>
<p>Faecal samples were collected from seventeen animals, each fed three different diets (high fibre, high fibre with a starch rich supplement and high fibre with an oil rich supplement). DNA was extracted and the V1–V2 regions of 16SrDNA were 454-pyrosequenced to investigate the faecal microbiome of the horse. The effect of age was also considered by comparing mature (8 horses aged 5–12) versus elderly horses (9 horses aged 19–28). A reduction in diversity was found in the elderly horse group. Significant differences between diets were found at an OTU level (52 OTUs at corrected Q&lt;0.1). The majority of differences found were related to the <italic>Firmucutes</italic> phylum (37) with some changes in <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> (6), <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> (3), <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> (2) and Spirochaetes (1). For the forage only diet,with no added starch or oil, we found 30/2934 OTUs (accounting for 15.9% of sequences) present in all horses. However the core (i.e. present in all horses) associated with the oil rich supplemented diet was somewhat smaller (25/3029 OTUs, 10.3% ) and the core associated with the starch rich supplemented diet was even smaller (15/2884 OTUs, 5.4% ). The core associated with samples across all three diets was extremely small (6/5689 OTUs accounting for only 2.3% of sequences) and dominated by the order <italic>Clostridiales</italic>, with the most abundant family being <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic>. In conclusion, forage based diets plus starch or oil rich complementary feeds were associated with differences in the faecal bacterial community compared with the forage alone. Further, as observed in people, ageing is associated with a reduction in bacterial diversity. However there was no change in the bacterial community structure in these healthy animals associated with age.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The gastrointestinal tract of mammals contains an extensive symbiotic microbial population composed of bacteria, phage, archaea, anaerobic fungi and protozoa. These microbes provide the host with essential nutrients, as well as modulating the immune system. In the horse, short chain fatty acids produced by microbial fermentation of fibre in the large intestine, provides a significant proportion of the animal’s daily energy requirements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Argenzio1">[1]</xref>. Despite the importance of microbes in supplying energy, little is still known about the overall composition of the microbial community (microbiome) in the equine hindgut. Several recent studies have characterised the faecal bacterial community of the equid using next generation sequencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Costa1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Steelman1">[4]</xref>. However, none of these studies have investigated the effect of diet on the gut microbiota. Carnivores, herbivores and omnivores cluster according to differences in their gut microbiota <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Ley1">[5]</xref> and diet is known to be a large driver of bacterial diversity between different species. In humans, diets enriched with animal protein and fat result in greater numbers of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> in the fecal microbiome, as compared to a plant based diets that are higher in fibre, that resultin higher numbers of <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> and cellulose and xylan degraders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-DeFillipo1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Wu1">[7]</xref>. Similarly, in mice fed high fat diets, <italic>Firmicutes</italic> (<italic>Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcus, Lactococcus</italic>) numbers increased and <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> numbers declined in fecal samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Zhang1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>It has been well documented that sudden introduction of readily fermentable starch/sugar to a horse’s diet results in marked alterations in the colonic microbial ecosystem. Changes include a drop in pH and increases in <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. and lactate concentration with a subsequent increase in lactate-utilising bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Goodson1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Milinovich1">[11]</xref>. Culture based microbiology has demonstrated increased counts of <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> and <italic>Streptococci</italic> coinciding with a decrease in cellulolytic bacterial numbers in horses maintained on a high starch diet compared to high fiber diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Medina1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-deFombelle2">[13]</xref>. However, few studies have used culture-independent techniques to study the influence of diet on the bacterial population in healthy horses over time. Willing <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Willing1">[14]</xref> used terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) to demonstrate a clear impact of high forage versus high carbohydrate diets on the fecal microbiome, where a high fibre diet resulted in greater stability and reduced bacteria associated with metabolic dysfunction. Whilst Daly <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Daly1">[15]</xref> found higher numbers of the phylum <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, the family <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> and the <italic>Bacillus-Lactobacillus-Streptococcus</italic> (BLS) group combined with lower numbers of <italic>Fibrobacter</italic> and <italic>Ruminococcus</italic> associated with increased dietary hydrolysable carbohydrate compared to a grass-based diet.</p>
<p>Age has also been shown to influence gastrointestinal bacterial diversity and community structure in humans. Studies have found an age-related reduction in diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Woodmansey1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Biagi1">[17]</xref> with a decline in some <italic>Bacteroidetes, Clostridia</italic> and <italic>Bifidibacteria</italic> and an increase in <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> and <italic>Bacilli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Biagi1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Mariat1">[19]</xref>. However, debate exists as to the influence of other environmental factors, including diet and geographical location <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Mueller1">[20]</xref>. To the authors’ knowledge, the influence of age has not been explored in relation to the bacterial community in the hindgut of the horse.</p>
<p>Here we present an investigation into the effect of three different diets (high fiber, fibre plus an oil rich supplement and fibre plus a starch rich supplement) on a group of seventeen healthy horses utilising 454 pyrosequencing to characterise the bacterial community of faeces. A cross over design was used allowing data to be collected from all 17 animals for each diet. Furthermore, the study group included 8 adult (5–12 yrs old) and 9 elderly individuals (19–28 yrs old).</p>

<title>Animal Nutrition Trial and Sample Collection</title>
<p>Faecal samples for microbiological investigation were collected as part of a wider nutritional study carried out at Michigan State University (USA). All animal procedures were approved by Michigan State University’s (MSU) Animal Care and Use Committee (approval #11/09-174-00). Seventeen healthy (with no dental abnormalities and that had recieved recent appropriate anthelmintic treatment) stock-type mares were chosen for their similar body type, size, body condition score (BCS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Henneke1">[21]</xref> and nutritional background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0087424.s003">Table S1</xref>). The horses were classified as either adult (8 horses aged 5–12 yrs) or elderly (9 horses aged 19–28 yrs). Within each age group, horses were stratified by age and BCS in order to pair one adult and one aged horse together with one group of three containing the additional elderly horse. The study was a modified Latin Square, cross over design with horse pairs randomly assigned to one of three diets for each 6 week feeding period (Diet composition <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0087424-t001">Table 1</xref>): hay alone (HAY), hay plus a high fibre, high oil and low cereal starch based complementary feed (OIL), and hay with a lower oil, cereal starch-rich concentrate (CHO). The hay used for all diets was timothy/mixed grass, the OIL diet was formulated with soya oil and the CHO diet was formulated using corn (cracked &amp; crimped), oat pellets and soya oil. During the study period all horses received each of the three diets, therefore data collected for each diet was from 17 animals. The HAY diet was initially fed at 1.6% bodyweight (BW) but this was increased after 31 days to 1.84% BW in order to maintain BW. The OIL and CHO diets were fed initially at 0.6% BW combined with hay at 1.0% BW hay but this was increased to 0.69% BW concentrate and 1.15% hay 31 days into the study. All diets were divided between two daily feedings at 0800 and 2000 hours. Horses changing to the OIL and CHO diets were fed gradually increasing amounts adjusted over a four-day period. Throughout, the horses were allowed ad libitum access to water. During each dietary period, each pair was housed in an individual dry lot paddock for 3 weeks of outdoor feeding. Horses were moved to MSU’s Veterinary Teaching Hospital and housed individually in 2.4×3 m box stalls for the final 3 weeks of the feeding periods. While stalled, the horses were turned out in a dry lot paddock for a minimum of 1 hour three times a week.</p>

<p>Faecal samples were collected during the final day of each dietary period. Three samples were taken during each sampling day (early morning, mid-day &amp; evening). Freshly voided faeces were selected and sub-sampled (approx 500 g) from the central portion to minimise contamination by bedding and flooring. After collection samples were stored on ice until frozen at −80°C prior to freeze drying.</p>

<title>DNA Extraction</title>
<p>Prior to extraction of nucleic acids, freeze dried samples were disrupted by bead beating. Freeze- dried samples (100 mg) were added to a 2 ml screw top tube and one autoclaved glass ball was added (4 mm, undrilled, G/0300/53, Fisher Scientific, UK). Samples were beaten for 90 s at 5000 rpm (maximum speed) in a Mini-Beadbeater™ (Biospec products Inc., Bartlesville, OK).

For each sample replicate PCR was performed in duplicate; a 25 µl reaction was prepared containing 5U µl<sup>−1</sup> FastStart High Fidelity Enzyme Blend, 10x FastStart High Fidelity Buffer with 18 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>(Roche Diagnostics Ltd., Burgess Hill, UK), 0.2 mM of each dNTP (Promega UK Ltd. Southampton, UK) with each primer used at 0.2 µM. For each reaction 1 µl DNA template at 2.5–125 ng/µl (as per Roche FastStart high Fidelity system recommendations) was used. The conditions used were a hot start of 95°C for 10 min, 95°C for 2 min followed by 22 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s and 72°C for 45 s with a final extension at 72°C for 7 min. Reactions were amplified in a T100™ thermal cycler (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK).

<title>Short Fragment Removal and Pooling of Libraries and Sequencing</title>
<p>Pooled PCR reaction products for all sample replicates were purified as per Roche technical bulletin 2011-007 (January 2012) ‘Short Fragment Removal Procedure for the Amplicon Library Preparation Procedure’ using Agencourt AMpure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Inc.,Fullerton, USA). DNA concentration of the purified PCR products was assessed using an Epoch Microplate Spectrophotometer with a Take3 Micro-Volume plate (BioTek UK, Potton, UK) to enable equi-molar pooling of samples into four libraries each containing 36 to 39 samples with unique barcode sequences. Each library was further purified using the E-Gel® System with E-Gel® SizeSelect™ 2% Agarose gel (Life Technologies Ltd, Paisley, UK). A final purification step using Agencout AMpure XP beads standard PCR purification procedure (Beckman Coulter Inc.,Fullerton, USA) was carried out for each library. To assess purity of the sample libraries a quality control PCR was carried out for each as detailed in Roche technical bulletin 2011-007. 25 µl reactions were prepared containing: 5U µl<sup>−1</sup> FastStart High Fidelity Enzyme Blend, 10x FastStart High Fidelity Buffer with 18 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (Roche Diagnostics Ltd., Burgess Hill, UK), 0.2 mM of each dNTP (Promega UK Ltd.

For each reaction 1 µl of each library containing 2×10<sup>8</sup> molecules/µl was used. The conditions used were 94°C for 11 min followed by 20 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 60°C for 1 min and 72C for 1 min with a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. On completion PCR products were incubated for 30 min at 37°C with 0.5 µl of Exonuclease I (New England BioLabs (UK) Ltd. Hitchin, UK). Reactions were amplified in a T100™ thermal cycler (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK). Products from the quality control PCR were assessed for quality and purified libraries were quantified on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with a High Sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent Technologies UK Ltd, Stockport, UK).

Taxonomic classification of OTU’s was carried out using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Classifier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Wang1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>Data were prepared and tables and figures produced using Microsoft Excel and the ‘R’ software environment (version 2.15; http//<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/" xlink:type="simple">www.r-project.org/</ext-link>). Simpson and Shannon-Wiener diversity indices were calculated using normalised data as recommended to reduce over-inflation of true diversity in pyrosequencing data sets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Gihring1">[27]</xref>. Species richness and diversity were then analysed by two-way ANOVA using GenStat® 12<sup>th</sup> edition. Each individual OTU was analysed for effects of diet and age by ANOVA (using GenStat® 12<sup>th</sup> edition). Although it was not possible to calculate skewness of the data, due to having only one replicate per treatment/animal combination, skewness was considered across all animal/treatment combinations for each OTU. Many of the OTUs showed marked skewness. Nevertheless ANOVA was performed as there is no non-parametric equivalent for a multi-factorial experiment. However to minimise the false discovery rate only OTUs with more than 100 occurances (across all samples) were analysed by ANOVA (579 OTUs). Furthermore, P values were adjusted using the method of Benjamini and Hochberg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Benjamini1">[28]</xref> where significance was set at Q &lt;0.1. A phylogenetic tree was constructed to display OTUs found to be significant for diet. The tree was constructed by 1) Sequences were aligned using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Pyrosequencing pipeline Aligner which utilizes the Infernal aligner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Nawrocki1">[29]</xref> 2) Tree built by UPGMA using Molecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis tool (MEGA) version 5.2. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Tamura1">[30]</xref> 3) Tree was graphically manipulated using the interactive tree of life (iTOL) tool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Letunic1">[31]</xref>. The core community at OTU level in faeces was defined by being present in all samples (each animal/diet combination) included in the study. When considering the core community in faeces for each diet, it was defined by being present in all animals for each diet.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>All horses remained healthy throughout the study with no gastrointestinal disturbances. One million, four hundred and sixty thousand, one hundred and twenty four sequences of average length 358 bp were obtained from the 454 FLX Titanium sequencing. Quality filtering resulted in 749,437 high quality sequences that were clustered into 5689 unique OTUs. Construction of a phylogenetic tree (data not shown) indicated that all samples from an animal on a sampling day (three across the day) clustered tightly together which allowed data from these samples to be pooled providing a minimum of 6197 sequences per sample day after normalisation. Rarefaction curves calculated from non-normalised data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0087424.s001">Figure S1</xref>) showed that for each sample the corresponding curve had not plateaued indicating that complete sampling of these environments had not yet been achieved. Good’s coverage estimates, however, indicated that a large part of the diversity in all samples had been captured with the average coverage being 96.3% (s.d. 1.6).</p>
<p>The bacterial community within faeces of horses on different diets was found to be highly diverse and even (as indicated by the Simpson and Shannon-Weiner diversity indices, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0087424-t002">Table 2</xref>) with no significant differences between diets. The bacterial community was significantly less diverse in the elderly horses (Shannon-Wiener P = 0.018, species richness P = 0.042). When exploring the data by principle component analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0087424.s002">Figure S2</xref>) no pattern was observed according to either diet or age. As principle component 1 (PC1) and principle component 2 (PC2) only accounted for 25% of the variance within the data discriminant function analysis with cross validation was conducted, however the model would not validate. Little difference could similarly be seen in the relative abundance of bacterial phyla under different diet/age combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087424-g001">Figure 1</xref>) with the only notable difference being an increase in <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> in the high oil and high starch diets.For all diet/age combinations the bacterial population in faeces was dominated by the <italic>Firmicutes</italic> (45%) followed by the <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> (37%) with smaller quantities (0.5–3.5%) of <italic>Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes, Actinobacteria</italic> and <italic>Tenericutes</italic> and very small amounts (0–0.4%) of <italic>Elusimicrobia, TM7, Synergistetes, SR1</italic> and <italic>Cyanobacteria/Chloroplast</italic>. Values shown for each phyla show little variation between individual animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0087424.s005">Table S3</xref>). Although little difference was seen at Phyla level when each individual OTU was compared by ANOVA, 52 were significantly different between diets but none were significantly different between age groups (corrected P&lt;0.1). For the OTUs that differed according to diet, 37 were <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, 6 <italic>Bacteroidetes,</italic> 3 <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>, 3 <italic>Unclassified,</italic> 2 <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> and 1 <italic>Spirochaetes</italic>.

<p>A small number of OTUs were identified which made up the core community in all faecal samples (all diets), 6 OTUs accounting for 2.3% of total sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087424-g003">Figure 3</xref>). When identifying a core community for each individual diet, a larger core was found than across all three diets; HAY diet-30 OTUs accounting for 15.9%, OIL diet-25 OTUs accounting for 10.3%, and CHO diet-15 OTUs accounting for 5.42%.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The horse is reliant on intake of large quantities of fibre that can be fermented by the microbiota found predominantly within the large intestine, to yield short chain fatty acids which in turn can be utilised for energy by the host. Due to increased demands placed on the equid for athletic performance, modern nutritional practices involve supplementation of this fibre-based diet with varying quantities of high energy-providing feedstuffs, in particular cereal grains and oil. When cereal starch is fed in small quantities, it is subjected to enzymatic breakdown and absorption of sugars in the small intestine, however when fed in large quantities, the small intestine’s capacity for starch digestion can be overloaded and a considerable amount may be passed to the hindgut where it undergoes rapid microbial fermentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-deFombelle1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Milinovich1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-ShiraziBeechey1">[32]</xref>. To accurately document how different diets influence the bacterial community in the caecum and colon, direct sampling following controlled feeding trials would be ideal. However, this is not practical and involves either cannulation or euthanasia. A more practical alternative is to document changes in the hindgut through exploration of the faecal microbiota which might be expected to contain representative organisms from all regions of the large intestine as they are moved physically with the digesta. In human studies, it has been suggested that faecal samples do not accurately reflect the population of the rest of the intestinal tract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Eckburg1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Durban1">[34]</xref>. Our previous work has demonstrated that there are differences in the microbial community found in the caecum compared to the right dorsal colon and faeces of horses and ponies with the main change in composition occurring at the point of the pelvic flexure between the ventral and dorsal colon. However, the microbiota of the distal hindgut (right dorsal colon through to the rectum) shares a similar composition to that of faeces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Dougal1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Dougal2">[36]</xref>, which, considering the importance of the right dorsal colon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Varoud1">[37]</xref> in fibre fermentation, means that studying the microbiota of faeces can provide useful information.</p>
<p>From the limited published work which has utilised next generation sequencing to document the bacterial community in the large intestine of the horse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Costa1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Steelman1">[4]</xref>, the dominant phylum appears to be <italic>Firmicutes</italic> (43–69%). We have similarly found this both in our previous work (46% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Dougal2">[36]</xref>) and in the current study regardless of diet or age (average 45%). There is, however, inconsistency over the next most abundant phylum (<italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> 14.2%, <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> 10.2% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Costa1">[2]</xref>, <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> and <italic>Verrucomicrobia</italic> 4.1% each, <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> 3.65% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Shepherd1">[3]</xref> or <italic>Verrucomicrobia</italic> 18.1%, <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> 5.7% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Steelman1">[4]</xref>). The higher numbers of <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> found in both this study (average 37%) and our previous work (43%) is in agreement with older culture-independent work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Willing1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Yamano1">[38]</xref>. We have identified smaller quantities (&lt;5%) of <italic>Fibrobacteres, Proteobacteria</italic>, <italic>Spirochaetes</italic> and <italic>Actinobacteria</italic>, again regardless of diet or age which is in agreement with our previous work and that of others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Shepherd1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Steelman1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Dougal2">[36]</xref> with a notable lack of <italic>Verrucomicrobia</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Costa1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>The concept of a core microbial population in the gut of mammals has recently received attention with a core community in the human gut identified, but differing in size dependent on the study design <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Turnbaugh1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Qin1">[41]</xref><monospace>. </monospace>What constitutes a core microbiome has not been well defined and factors such as sequencing depth and OTU clustering methods may influence identification of the presence of a core, estimation of the true size of that core (both the number and relative abundance of OTUs) and detection of core members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Sekelja1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-JalankaTuovinen1">[42]</xref>. In the horse, a core bacterial community in faeces has been suggested; with 123 out of 1620 identified OTUs present in each of 4 animals, with 6 of these having an abundance of greater than 25 occurrences per animal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Costa1">[2]</xref>. Our previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Dougal2">[36]</xref> also identifies a core, but smaller in size (25/2566 OTUs accounting for 13.7% of sequences). When considering the core community associated with a forage only, HAY diet in the current study, a similar size of core is seen to our previous work (30/2934 OTUs accounting for 15.9% of sequences). However, the core associated with the OIL diet was somewhat smaller (25/3029 OTUs accounting for 10.3% of sequences) and the core associated with a high starch providing, CHO diet was much smaller (15/2884 OTUs accounting for 5.4% of sequences). Interestingly, the core associated with samples across all three diets is extremely small in comparison to both the individual diets (6/5689 OTUs accounting for 2.3% of sequences) and other core communities from other gut environments such as in the rumen of the cow (157/4986 OTUs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Jami1">[43]</xref>. Another feature of the core community in the horse is that it is comprised of low abundance OTUs and is not dominated by any individual OTUs or bacterial families; the largest family found in the core associated with all diets is responsible for only 1.3% of all sequences. Core populations in other environments such as the oral cavity of dogs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Zaura1">[44]</xref> and humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Sturgeon1">[45]</xref> and the tonsils of pigs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Lowe1">[46]</xref> are characterised by having a few highly dominant OTUs. Regardless of the approach used, clostridia have been consistently identified as the most prevalent class of bacteria in the core community of the human gut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Turnbaugh1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Sekelja1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-JalankaTuovinen1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Booijink1">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Tap1">[48]</xref>. Members of this class that have been identified as part of the human core are <italic>Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Clostridiaceae</italic> and <italic>Streptococcaceae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Turnbaugh1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Sekelja1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-JalankaTuovinen1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Tap1">[48]</xref>. Bacteroidetes have also been shown to be core, but at low numbers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-JalankaTuovinen1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Tap1">[48]</xref>. Our data for the horse would interestingly seem to mirror this pattern with <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> being the most abundant in the core in the current work (also found by Costa <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Costa1">[2]</xref>). Our previous data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Dougal2">[36]</xref> identified <italic>Prevotellaceae</italic> followed by <italic>Ruminoccocaceae</italic>, <italic>Fibrobacteraceae,</italic> then <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> as being the most abundant members of the core community and is similar to what has been reported in cattle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Jami1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Durso1">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Petri1">[50]</xref>. As <italic>Lachnospiraceae,</italic> in particular, have been shown to exist in most mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Turnbaugh1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Sekelja1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-JalankaTuovinen1">[42]</xref> and have been found in 71% of the order Perissodactyla <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Ley2">[51]</xref>, this would be suggestive that this family may appear in the intestinal core of all mammals. The importance of this family in a gut core bacterial population is perhaps not surprising given that <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> are known butyrate producers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-JalankaTuovinen1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Cotta1">[52]</xref> and butyrate is known to have a protective function on colonocytes in the gut wall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Pryde1">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Brown1">[54]</xref>.</p>
<p>The lack of a substantial bacterial core combined with a lack of obvious ‘key’ members may help explain why the horse is so susceptible to disruption in its microbiota from its normal state resulting in subsequent gastrointestinal disorder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Dougal2">[36]</xref>. Furthermore, the reduction in core size when horses are fed a diet other than one high in fibre and, particularly when fed a high starch supplemented diet, may increase the risk for subsequent metabolic dysfunction.</p>
<p>The gastrointestinal tract of humans is initially colonised by bacteria at birth and the population increases in diversity over the first three years of life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Palmer1">[55]</xref>.

<p>In other mammals (human, mouse, cow), diet has been shown to be a strong driver of gut microbiota with obvious clustering of individuals according to type of diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-DeFillipo1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Zhang1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Petri1">[50]</xref>. In this study, such a pattern was not seen when analysing the total bacterial population, which is in a contrast with recent work in cows where samples clustered separately when starch was added to the diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Zened1">[62]</xref>. Only when individual OTUs were analysed were differences found, a possible explanation for this may be that as the core bacterial community in the faeces of the horse accounts for only a small proportion of the total community, changes may not be big enough to be seen at a general level of investigation. Furthermore, the effect of individual animals would appear to have a highly significant effect on the bacterial community and may indeed mask any dietary effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Willing1">[14]</xref>. Of the 52 OTUs found to show significant differences between diets (corrected P&lt;0.1), the majority are classified as <italic>Firmicutes</italic> (37 OTUs) with some <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> (6 OTUs), <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> (3 OTUs), <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> (2 OTUs) and Spirochaetes (1 OTU). Different OTUs belonging to the family <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> were found at different numbers in each of the three diets, with specific OTUs belonging to this family being significantly higher for each diet. When feeding the forage only diet, the OTUs that are significantly more abundant than in the other two diets are primarily <italic>Clostridiales</italic>. For the forage only and OIL diets, a member of the <italic>Firmicutes</italic> phylum, genus <italic>Acidaminococcus</italic> was significantly more abundant than with the starch supplemented diet. The OIL diet also shows most significant increases in abundance associated with the <italic>Clostridiales</italic>, including elevated numbers of <italic>Ruminococcus Oscillibacter</italic>. Although little is known about the function of this genus, it has been found to increase in abundance associated with high fat diets of mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Zhang2">[63]</xref> and humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Walker1">[64]</xref>; indicating a role in fat metabolism. When considering the starch supplemented diet, yet again the biggest changes seen centre around the <italic>Clostridiales</italic>, including <italic>Lachnospiraceae,</italic> similar to the influence of starch in cattle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Zened1">[62]</xref>, and <italic>Roseburia.</italic> Also of note is an increase in abundance of an OTU belonging to the <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> phylum, genus <italic>Succinivibrio</italic>. Both <italic>Roseburia</italic> and <italic>Succinivibrio</italic> have been shown to significantly increase in cattle changed from a high fibre to a high starch diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Petri1">[50]</xref>. <italic>Roseburia</italic> is a butyrate producer and although little is known about the function of <italic>Succinivibrio,</italic> it is found to be more abundant in cattle on a high starch diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Petri1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-OHerrin1">[65]</xref> and it has also been identified as an important component of the gut microbiome in the bee which relies on a starch rich diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Matilla1">[66]</xref>. Enrichment of <italic>Succinivibrio</italic> in these gut environments may be suggestive of a role in starch metabolism. Previous work in relation to dietary change in the horse has identified increases in <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> and the <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> phylum associated with a high starch diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Daly1">[15]</xref>. The fact that the <italic>Clostridiales</italic> appear to be the most influential across all diets in this study is consistent with findings in humans that the Clostridia Clusters IV and XIVa are very sensitive to dietary influence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087424-Claesson1">[59]</xref>.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Characterisation of the bacterial community from the hind gut of healthy horses is essential to enable comparison to disease state and thus develop diagnostic tests, prophylactic measures and appropriate treatments. Here we show that feeding different diets results in significant changes in the faecal bacterial microbiome. Also identified is a reduction in bacterial diversity in older horses. Furthermore we confirm the presence of only a small core bacterial community which is found in all horses regardless of age or diet, composed predominantly of the <italic>Lachnospiraceae.</italic> The presence of such a small core may begin to explain why the horse is so susceptible to metabolic dysfunction.</p>
