<abstract>
<p>Requirements of large numbers of transferred T cells and various immunosuppressive factors and cells in the tumor microenvironment limit the applications of adoptive T cells therapy (ACT) in clinic. Accumulating evidences show that chemotherapeutic drugs could act as immune supportive instead of immunosuppressive agents when proper dosage is used, and combined with immunotherapy often results in better treatment outcomes than monotherapy. Controversial immunomodulation effects of sorafenib, a multi-kinases inhibitor, at high and low doses have been reported in several types of cancer. However, what is the range of the low-dose sorafenib will influence the host immunity and responses of ACT is still ambiguous. Here we used a well-established E.G7/OT-1 murine model to understand the effects of serial low doses of sorafenib on both tumor microenvironment and transferred CD8+ T cells and the underlying mechanisms. Sorafenib lowered the expressions of immunosuppressive factors, and enhanced functions and migrations of transferred CD8+ T cells through inhibition of STAT3 and other immunosuppressive factors. CD8+ T cells were transduced with granzyme B promoter for driving imaging reporters to visualize the activation and distribution of transferred CD8+ T cells prior to adoptive transfer. Better activations of CD8+ T cells and tumor inhibitions were found in the combinational group compared with CD8+ T cells or sorafenib alone groups. Not only immunosuppressive factors but myeloid derived suppressive cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) were decreased in sorafenib-treated group, indicating that augmentation of tumor inhibition and function of CD8+ T cells by serial low doses of sorafenib were <italic>via</italic> reversing the immunosuppressive microenvironment. These results revealed that the tumor inhibitions of sorafenib not only through eradicating tumor cells but modifying tumor microenvironment, which helps outcomes of ACT significantly.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) is considered to be a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. However, the clinical outcome and application of ACT are impeded by the requirement of large amounts of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells for infusion, anergy or apoptosis of transferred CD8+ T cells, and inadequate numbers of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Mondino1">[1]</xref>. Increasing evidences show that immunosuppressive networks in the tumor microenvironment act as substantial barriers to T cell response. Cancer cells hinder T cells responses through several pathways, including impairing antigen presentation, activating negative co-stimulatory signals (CTLA-4/B7 and PD-1/PD-L1), secreting immunosuppressive factors (i.e. transforming frowth factor-β (TGF-β) and interleukin-10 (IL-10)) to recruit immunosuppressive cells like regulatory T cells (Tregs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and triggering proapoptotic pathways (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), Fas ligand (FasL) and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)) in effector T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Rabinovich1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Leen1">[3]</xref>. Because of high heterogeneity and dynamics of cancer, combination therapies are thought to be more efficient for cancer treatment than monotherapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Gillies1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Vanneman1">[6]</xref>. However, combination of ACT and chemotherapy was reported as incompatible due to the induction of lymphopenia and immunosuppressive cytokines, and the inhibition of effector T cell function by chemotherapy at first <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Rasmussen1">[7]</xref>. Nevertheless, later reports show that preconditioning radiotherapy or chemotherapy performed before CD8+ T cell transfer modifies unfavorable tumor microenvironments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Hawkins1">[8]</xref>, and improve the effectiveness of T cell therapy through inducing tumor cell deaths, eliminating Tregs, and enhancing tumor cell killing by effector T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Ramakrishnan1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Galluzzi1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>Sorafenib, a multi- kinase inhibitor (TKI), blocks cancer progression through inhibiting RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK-MAPK pathway, which relates to the proliferation, migration and angiogenesis of cancer cells by targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), c-kit and a receptor tyrosine kinase called rearranged during transfection (RET) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Wilhelm1">[11]</xref>. Different from sunitinib, sorafenib has been reported that affects maturation and functions of dendritic cells (DCs), reduces the T cells responses, and is inappropriate for combination with immunotherapies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Hipp1">[12]</xref>. On the other hand, several groups showed that sorafenib depletes frequencies of Tregs in RCC patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Busse1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Desar1">[14]</xref>. Sorafenib also has been shown with higher cytotoxicity to CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> regulatory/suppressor T cells as compared with CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, indicating that sorafenib could eliminate Tregs without harming effector T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Molhoek1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Cabrera1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>The underlying immunomodulation mechanisms of sorafenib and whether sorafenib could augment treatment outcomes of immunotherapies as ACT are still unclear. A well-established E.G7/OT-1 murine model combined with the <italic>pGBeLT</italic> imaging system to monitor the activation and distribution of CD8+ T cells after serial low doses of sorafenib treatments was used for therapeutic efficacy evaluation of ACT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Chang1">[17]</xref>. In brief, level of granzyme B increases when T cells are activated, thus, using granzyme B promoter to drive downstream imaging reporters may represent the activation of T cells. The results show that serial low doses of sorafenib enhances therapeutic responses of ACT significantly without harming the normal immunity. Sorafenib lowers the expressions of immunosuppressive proteins (e.g. TGF-β, IL-10 and VEGF) then augments the function and migration of CD8+ T cells both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, serial low doses of sorafenib (7.5 mg/kg/day) reduce the percentages of Tregs and MDSCs, increase the numbers of activating T cells, and prolong the period of T cells activation. Our results suggest that the low doses of sorafenib augment ACT through reversing immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and enhancing the functions of transferred CD8+ T cells.</p>

<title>Sorafenib inhibits the expression of multiple immunosuppressive factors and death receptor ligand in tumor cells</title>
<p>Cytotoxicity of sorafenib was determined by AlamarBlue assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109992-g001">Figure 1</xref>), and the IC50 of sorafenib on E.G7 cells was 15 µM in the following experiments, the doses of sorafenib used were &lt;15 µM (i.e. lower than IC50). To understand whether sorafenib could enhance treatment outcomes of ACT, expressions of well-known immunosuppressive factors including IDO, VEGF, IL-10, TGF-β, and CCL2/MCP-1 in E.G7 cells were evaluated by Western blotting. Sorafenib treatment decreased expressions of these immunosuppressive factors in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109992-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Another immunosuppressive factor, IDO, converts tryptophan to kynurenine resulting in apoptosis of T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Chen1">[20]</xref>. Except for endogenous expression, IDO could be exogenously induced by IFN-<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0109992.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Thus, E.G7 cells stimulated with IFN-γ were treated with sorafenib, and the level of IDO was evaluated by Western blotting. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109992-g002">Figure 2B</xref> shows that sorafenib inhibited both endogenous and exogenous IDO expressions. TGF-β signaling pathway starts from the binding of TGF-β with TGF-β I and II heterodimer receptors, and the autocrine TGF-β is highly related to endothelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) and metastases of cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Derynck1">[21]</xref>. Accordingly, the level of TGF-β receptor I was also assessed by flow cytometry to understand how sorafenib affects TGF-β signaling pathway. As inhibiting of TGF-β, the level of TGF-β receptor I was significantly decreased after sorafenib treatment in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109992-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Fas/FasL signaling pathway triggers apoptosis of T cells, besides tryptophan deprivation by IDO. Interestingly, expression of FasL on the surface of E.G7 cells was significantly lowered by sorafenib in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109992-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) (Left panel) Expressions of immunosuppressive factors were assayed by Western blotting, and (right panel) their quantitative results. IDO, VEGF, IL-10 and TGF-βwere decreased in a dose-dependent manner in E.G7 cells treated with 5–15 µM sorafenib for 24 hours. In addition, expressions of pSTAT3 and CCL2/MCP-1 also were decreased. (B) Expression of IDO in E.G7 cells treated with exogenous IFN-γto mimic the tumor-bearing animal model. Sorafenib decreases both endogenous and exogenous IDO expressions. (C) Expression of TGF-βreceptor I was assessed by flow cytometry. TGF-βreceptor I was significant decreased after 2–15 µM sorafenib treatments. (D) Survival of CD8+ T cells would affect the therapeutic outcome of ACT, and apoptosis of CD8+ T cells is mainly through Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) pathway.

Both numbers of tomato fluorescent protein-expressing and IFN-γ- producing CD8+ T cells were significantly increased (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109992-g003">Figure 3A, B</xref>). The killing effects of CD8+ T cells on sorafenib-treated E.G7 cells was determined by <sup>51</sup>Cr-release assay, and the cytotoxicity of T cells was found significantly increased after sorafenib treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109992-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Numbers of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells are another key to better ACT outcomes, thus, the migratory ability of CD8+ T cells was determined by transwell assay. Compared with both medium- and untreated controls, CD8+ T cells co-cultured with sorafenib-treated E.G7 cells showed significantly better migratory ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109992-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>

<title>Sorafenib mediates the immunomodulation through the inhibition of STAT3</title>
<p>STAT3 plays a critical role in mediating the antitumor effect of sorafenib on hepatocellular carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Tai1">[22]</xref>.

To verify that sorafenib downregulating immunosuppressive factors shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109992-g002">Figure 2A</xref> is related to STAT3 signaling pathway, the STAT3 inhibitor, WP1066 was used as a positive control. The results showed that STAT3 inhibition downregulated the expressions of IDO, VEGF, IL-10 and CCL2/MCP-1, which also examined in sorafenib-treated E.G7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109992-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>pGBeLT</italic>-transduced CD8+ T cells were co-cultured with WP1066-treated E.G7 cells, determined by flow cytometry and transwell assay. The percentages of both tomato fluorescent protein and intracellular IFN-γ expressions were increased significantly in the WP1066-treated group as compared with the non-treated one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109992-g004">Figure 4B, C</xref>).

<title>Serial low doses of sorafenib enhance the therapeutic efficacy of adoptively transferred CD8+ T cells <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>When tumor sizes reached 100 mm<sup>3</sup>, E.G7 tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into five groups: sorafenib alone (sora), 2×10<sup>6</sup> CD8+ T cells (2T), 5×10<sup>6</sup> CD8+ T cells (5T), 2×10<sup>6</sup> CD8+ T cells plus sorafenib (2T+sora), and vehicle control, to determine whether serial low doses of sorafenib could increase the accumulation and activation of transferred CD8+ T cells in target tumors <italic>in vivo</italic>. Mice were received sorafenib by gavage one day before ACT followed by four consecutive doses; the activation of transferred <italic>pGBeLT</italic>-transduced CD8+ T cells and tumor growth monitoring by BLI and caliper measurement were performed, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109992-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The signal of <italic>pGBeLT</italic>-transduced CD8+ T cells was slightly increased from day 0 to day 2, and reached its peak on day 3 in all groups with CD8+ T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109992-g005">Figure 5B, C</xref>). No significant difference of signal intensity was found between 5T and 2T+sora groups, indicating that sorafenib enhanced the recruitment and activation of CD8+ T cells in target tumors. Sorafenib alone did not show significant tumor inhibition, and 2T group exhibited moderate tumor inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109992-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). However, both 2T+sora and 5T groups showed similar tumor inhibitions with substantial tumor regression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109992-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). To further investigate whether sorafenib affects the expressions of immunosuppressive in the tumor microenvironment as <italic>in vitro</italic>, <italic>ex vivo</italic> assay in mice bearing E.G7 tumors were conducted. Mice were sacrificed on day 5 post sorafenib treatment, the expressions of immunosuppressive proteins in tumors were detected by Western blotting. The expressions of immunosuppressive proteins were found reduced in comparison with control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109992-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), indicating that immunosuppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment also were suppressed, since TGF-β, IL-10 and IDO were related to the induction of Tregs and MDSCs. Moreover, MDSCs are thought to be another important negative regulator of CD8+ T cells recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Gabrilovich1">[24]</xref>; hence, cells were isolated from TDLNs and bone marrow, and evaluated the changes of Tregs and MDSCs, respectively, using flow cytometry. The percentages of both Tregs and MDSCs were decreased on day 3 compared with the vehicle control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109992-g006">Figures 6B, C</xref>). The results showed that sorafenib could downregulate immunosuppressive cell populations, resulting in the improvement of CD8+ T cell function. Most importantly, no significant change was found in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations of the host after sorafenib treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109992-g006">Figures 6D, E</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Both of preclinical and clinical studies have shown that the tumor microenvironment plays an indispensable role in limiting the effectiveness of ACT. Blocking the key regulatory pathways of immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment can improve antitumor effects of ACT substantially. In this study, a well-established E.G7/OT-1 murine model was utilized to prove that sorafenib, a multi-kinases targeting drug used in HCC and RCC treatments, can reverse the unfavorable tumor microenvironment and enhance therapeutic efficacies of ACT both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>The combination of ACT with chemotherapy for cancer treatments is still challenging because of the immunosuppressive effects of most chemotherapeutic drugs. Chemotherapeutic drugs such as paclitaxel (TAX), cisplatin (CIS), and doxorubicin (DOX) have been shown some positive immunological effects which may help outcomes of ACT. These drugs modify the immune microenvironment <italic>via</italic> several mechanisms, including better immunogenicity induced by tumor apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Menard1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Krysko1">[26]</xref>, upregulations of tumor-associated antigens and mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) expressions and modulation of Fas/TRAIL-dependent pathway sensitize tumor cells to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Micheau1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Lacour1">[29]</xref>, elimination of Tregs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Ghiringhelli1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Ghiringhelli2">[31]</xref>, and disruption of tumor stromal caused larger numbers of tumor-infiltrating CTLs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Zhang1">[32]</xref>. Sorafenib downregulates the expression of TGF-βin E.G7 cells, and other immunosuppressive factors, such as IDO, VEGF and IL-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109992-g002">Figures 2A, B</xref>). Not only TGF-β expression was decreased, but fewer TGF-β I receptors on cell surfaces were found after sorafenib treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109992-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that sorafenib blocks the TGF-β signaling pathway, which is critical for tumor progression and immunosuppression. IDO, VEGF and IL-10 have been reported to lower the activities of CD8+ T cells, increase the conversion of Tregs from CD4+ T cells and polarize macrophages into immunosuppressive M2 subtype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Rabinovich1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Leen1">[3]</xref>. On the other hand, the number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) also contributes to the result of ACT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Breart1">[33]</xref>. Angiogenesis is highly related to infiltration of CD8+ T cells and regulation of other immunosuppressive cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Tartour1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Huang1">[35]</xref>, and sorafenib has been shown to target the expression of VEGFR in the endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Wilhelm1">[11]</xref> and reduce the expression of VEGF in cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Kuo1">[18]</xref>. Moreover, CCL2/MCP-1, acting as a monocyte chemoattractant and immunosuppressive factor, inhibits CD8+ T cells infiltration through the recruitment of TAMs and Tregs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Mitchem1">[36]</xref>. CCL2/MCP-1 plays a key role for immunosuppression, so that inhibition of CCL2/CCR2 pathway could be a possible approach for cancer treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Fridlender1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-KudoSaito1">[38]</xref>. Prolonging the survival of CD8+ T cells has been proofed related to outcome of ACT by transduced with Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Charo1">[39]</xref>. FasL plays an influential role in immunosuppression by sensitizing activated CD8+ T cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-OConnell1">[40]</xref>. Ryan et al. demonstrated that blocking FasL expression would suppress the immune escape <italic>in vivo</italic> by using FasL<sup>-/low</sup> cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Ryan1">[41]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109992-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, the FasL expression of E.G7 was decreased after sorafenib treatment, which may inhibit Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis in CD8+ T cells.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the killing effects, activation and migratory abilities of CD8+ T cells were measured by flow cytometry, <sup>51</sup>Cr-release and transwell assays. CD8+ T cells co-cultured with sorafenib-treated E.G7 cells were shown with higher killing effects, activation, and migratory abilities as compared to those co-cultured with untreated E.G7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109992-g003">Figure 3</xref>), suggesting that the suppressions of immunosuppressive factors after sorafenib treatment should play a role in tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109992-g002">Figure 2</xref>). STAT3 is an important regulator of immunosuppression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Yu1">[42]</xref>. For instance, TGF-β VEGF and IL-10 expressions are regulated by STAT3; furthermore, these proteins insure the continuance of STAT3 activation in immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Thus, inhibiting STAT3 in cancer cells would be a novel approach to reverse immunosuppression and improve results of immunotherapies. Kujawski et al. verified the impact of STAT3 on ACT and showed the restoration of T cell activity and better tumor inhibition in STAT3<sup>-/-</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Kujawski1">[23]</xref>. In their study, another TKI, sunitinib was used to combine with ACT. Phospho-STAT3 (pSTAT3) expressed in tumor cells was inhibited by sunitinib treatment. Moreover, sunitinib treatment resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition, elevated numbers of TILs and decreased Tregs accumulation in tumors. Sorafenib has been proved to downregulate STAT3 pathway in several types of cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Tai1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Yang1">[43]</xref>, and similar results were also found in this study. Moreover, WP1066, an STAT3 inhibitor, was used as a positive control in this study to verify the lower expressions of those immunosuppressive factors related to downregulation of STAT3 signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109992-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of TGF-β did not change in E.G7 cells after WP1066 treatment. However, sorafenib modifies the tumor microenvironment not only through STAT3 pathway, but TGF-β pathway as well. Whether sorafenib improves the tumor microenvironment to enhance the function of OT-1 CD8+ T cells through other signal pathways other than STAT3 pathway needs to be further investigated.</p>
<p>To investigate how sorafenib augments functions of CD8+ T cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, we applied five consecutive low doses of sorafenib (7.5 mg/kg/day) to a well-established E.G7/OT-1 murine model for understanding the immune modulations and clarifying whether this approach could be applied in ACT. The numbers of CD8+ T cells for combination therapy was determined according to our preliminary study. Various numbers of CD8+ T cells were transferred into E.G7 tumor-bearing mice, the tumors grew again from day 9 after adoptive transfer when two million or less CD8+ T cells were transferred. On the contrary, complete tumor inhibition was found in mice received 5×10<sup>6</sup> or 10×10<sup>6</sup> CD8+ T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0109992.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Thus, 2×10<sup>6</sup> CD8+ T cells (2T) were used for combination with low doses of sorafenib. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109992-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, the activation of CD8+ T cells in 2T+sora group was similar to that of 5T group and was significantly better than that of 2T alone group. The peak signals obtained from these two groups were detected on day 3 post ACT, but the signal of the 2T+sora group existed longer than that of 5T group. Notably, tumors started to shrink from day 3 in both 5T and 2T+sora groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109992-g005">Figure 5D</xref>) with no significant difference between these two groups, suggesting that the combination of smaller numbers of CD8+ T cells with serial low doses of sorafenib as a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. In addition, sorafenib decreased STAT3 and related immunosuppressive factors after serial low doses of sorafenib treatment as shown by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109992-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Some of these proteins are thought to be related to the expansion of Tregs and MDSCs, both could result in the inhibition of CD8+ T cells. Here we found that these two immunosuppressive cells were decreased after serial low doses of sorafenib treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109992-g006">Figures 6B, C</xref>). These findings are similar to those reported by Cao et al. in a murine liver cancer model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Cao1">[19]</xref>, in which the percentages of Tregs and MDSCs were significantly decreased after tumor-bearing mice were treated with 30 mg/kg/day for two weeks. Although both types of cells were decreased, no significance was found in our study. The possible reasons responsible for this difference may be due to the low dose, i.e. 7.5 mg/kg/day (one fourth of the dose used by Cao et al.), and the shorter treatment time (five days) were used in this study. Recently, Chen et al. also showed that sorafenib decreased Tregs population and PD-1 expressions on CD8+ T cells in a HCC-bearing animal model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Chen2">[44]</xref>, which were similar to our findings.</p>
<p>The usual dose of sorafenib used for the treatments of advanced HCC, RCC and thyroid cancer is 400 mgx2/day <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Llovet1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Brose1">[47]</xref>, however, adverse side effects are reported including hand-foot syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Azad1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Gutzmer1">[49]</xref>, skin tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-ElTal1">[50]</xref> and small intestine hemorrhage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Takahashi1">[51]</xref>. The dosage used in mice can be converted into the human equivalent dose (HED) with the following formula: HED (mg/kg)  =  dose in mouse (mg/kg) ×3<sub>(mouse Km)</sub>/37<sub>(human Km)</sub>, in which Km is the body weight divided by the body surface area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-ReaganShaw1">[52]</xref>. The dosage of sorafenib (7.5 mg/kg/day) used here resulted in a HED is only about one twentieth as compared to the usual dose. Doses of sorafenib often used in the mouse model range from 15 to 100 mg/kg/day <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Kuo1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Cao1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Kharaziha1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-BaronToaldo1">[54]</xref>. Therefore, the 7.5 mg/kg/day of sorafenib is so called as “low dose” in this study, which may avoid the adverse side effects found under the usual dosage.</p>
<p>Hosoi et al. proved that CD8+ T cells themselves recruit MDSCs to tumors by secreting IFN-γ and CCL2/MCP-1, which would further inhibit transferred CD8+ T cells and reduce the outcome of ACT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Hosoi1">[55]</xref>. New strategies to improve the survival and function of transferred CD8+ T cells are needed, to extend the “transient” antitumor effects of regular ACT. Increasing evidences show that sorafenib improves the antitumor effects through both innate and adaptive immunity, including enhancement of the crosstalk between macrophages and NK cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Sprinzl1">[56]</xref>, and downregulation of Tregs in RCC patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Busse1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Desar1">[14]</xref>. On the other hand, BRAF inhibitors have been shown to ameliorate functions of CD8+ T cells through downregulation of VEGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Liu1">[57]</xref> or CCL2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109992-Knight1">[58]</xref> in tumors, suggesting that sorafenib may be helpful in combination with ACT under the optimal dose and suitable timing since sorafenib is also a BRAF inhibitor.</p>
<p>Our findings may pave the way for clinical ACT studies in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer or hepatocellular carcinoma who will receive sorafenib as a standard care. Once phase I clinical studies in this particular cancer entity have been successfully conducted, one might even think of administering low-dose sorafenib as an enhancer of immune therapies such as ACT or other in different cancer entities, including melanoma or multiple myeloma. In the future, it will be worth to discover other immunomodulatory agents as sorafenib to be combined with ACT or other immune therapies, and the effects of low-dose sorafenib on other immune cells, such as DCs and TAMs, in ACT, to further elucidate the panorama of immune system and the tumor microenvironment in ACT. In conclusion, low doses of sorafenib may be an ideal immunomodulatory agent for improving the therapeutic outcome of ACT through downregulation of immunosuppressive factors and enhancement of T cells functions <italic>via</italic> inhibitions of STAT3. Inhibitions of these immunosuppressive factors decrease the conversion of Tregs and induction of MDSCs, which otherwise will impede the function of CD8+ T cells. IDO, responsible for tryptophan metabolism in tumor cells, is decreased both endogenous and exogenous after sorafenib treatment. Transferred CD8+ T cells may exhibit better functions and survive longer and improve the therapeutic efficacy of ACT when these immunosuppressive factors and cells decline <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109992-g007">Figure 7</xref>. Furthermore, administration of low doses of sorafenib prior to ACT could reduce the numbers of transferred CD8+ T cells, which is one of obstacles hindering ACT applications. Using this combinational strategy would facilitate the employment of ACT; on the other hand, the lower doses of sorafenib and CD8+ T cells may also improve the quality of life of patients.</p>
