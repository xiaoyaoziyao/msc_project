<abstract>
<p>Fibrosis is a significant health problem associated with a chronic inflammatory reaction. The precise mechanisms involved in the fibrotic process are still poorly understood. However, given that inflammation is a major causative factor, immunomodulation is a possible therapeutic approach to reduce fibrosis. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) that is present in all hematopoietic cells has been associated with immunomodulation. We investigated whether the intraperitoneal administration of paricalcitol, a specific activator of the VDR, modulates peritoneal dialysis fluid (PDF)-induced peritoneal fibrosis. We characterized the inflammatory process in the peritoneal cavity of mice treated or not treated with paricalcitol and analyzed the ensuing fibrosis. The treatment reduced peritoneal IL-17 levels, which strongly correlated with a significantly lower peritoneal fibrotic response. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies demonstrate that both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells appear to impact the regulation of IL-17. Paricalcitol treatment resulted in a significantly increased frequency of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells showing a regulatory phenotype. The frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs tends to be increased, but it did not achieve statistical significance. However, paricalcitol treatment increased the number of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> Treg cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. In conclusion, the activation of immunological regulatory mechanisms by VDR signaling could prevent or reduce fibrosis, as shown in peritoneal fibrosis induced by PDF exposure in mice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tissue fibrosis is the consequence of abnormal healing processes that are typically associated with chronic inflammation, and is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. The molecular and cellular mechanisms that contribute to the development of fibroproliferative diseases are still poorly understood, hindering the development of efficient therapies. Understanding the specific mechanisms involved could contribute to the development of therapeutic procedures.</p>
<p>Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a renal replacement therapy for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This therapy uses the peritoneum as a semi-permeable membrane, exposing it to a bio-incompatible, glucose-containing hyperosmotic solution known as peritoneal dialysis fluid (PDF). When chronically exposed to PDF, patients develop peritoneal fibrosis and ultrafiltration failure, which compromises treatment efficacy and patient outcomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Krediet1">[1]</xref>. The mesothelial cell monolayer is the first line of contact between the PDF and the body, and could trigger a peritoneal aseptic inflammatory process. The exposure of mesothelial cells to glucose degradation products (GDPs), Amadori adducts and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) stimulated NF-κB-mediated transcription and the secretion of cytokines and chemokines <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Mortier1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Musi1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Nevado1">[4]</xref>. PD results in increased serum concentrations of IL-6, TNF-α, VEGF and C-reactive proteins in patients, which suggests that PD leads to increased systemic inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-PecoitsFilho1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-PecoitsFilho2">[6]</xref>. Using a mouse model of chronic peritoneal exposure to PDF, we had already demonstrated that PDF induces peritoneal membrane inflammation and fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-GonzalezMateo1">[7]</xref>. The use of an anti-inflammatory drug (a Cox-2 inhibitor) reduced peritoneal inflammation and fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Aroeira1">[8]</xref>. This result confirms the role of inflammation in peritoneal fibrosis. However, the cardiovascular effects of this drug family preclude its use in patients undergoing PD.</p>
<p>In addition to its classic metabolic action, vitamin D has an immunomodulatory function. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a nuclear hormone receptor expressed in B, T, macrophages and dendritic cells, and it regulates their proliferation and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Bikle1">[9]</xref>. Vitamin D can prevent or ameliorate inflammatory disease in animal autoimmune disease models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Cantorna1">[10]</xref> and in patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Ginanjar1">[11]</xref>. The mechanism by which vitamin D regulates inflammatory response appears to be dependent on the activation of regulatory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Jeffery1">[12]</xref>. These regulatory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells control IL-17 and IFN-γ secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Chaudhry1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Liesz1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Zhang1">[15]</xref>. Because inflammation plays an important role in peritoneal fibrosis, vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling might have a beneficial impact on PDF-induced peritoneal fibrosis. Paricalcitol is a selective VDR activator used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism, a disorder often seen in patients with chronic renal failure. As a VDR activator, paricalcitol has shown anti-inflammatory activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Tan1">[16]</xref>. Therefore, given its various therapeutic targets, paricalcitol could represent a very interesting treatment for patients undergoing PD. To address the impact of VDR signaling on peritoneal fibrosis, paricalcitol was added to a commercial PDF, and its effect on PDF-induced peritoneal inflammation and fibrosis was addressed in a mouse model of peritoneal dialysis. The results demonstrate that paricalcitol prevents peritoneal membrane deterioration, reducing fibrosis and ultrafiltration failure. The mechanism of protection appears to be dependent on the increased frequency of regulatory T cells and the reduction in IL-17 production in the peritoneal cavity.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Animals and surgery</title>
<p>The experimental procedure was approved by the ethics committee for animal welfare of La Paz University Hospital (CEBA 06-2009). Female C57BL/6 mice, from 12–14 weeks of age, were purchased from Charles River (Barcelona, Spain) and maintained in conventional conditions in our animal facilities. Catheter implantation was performed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Aroeira1">[8]</xref>. The state of the animals' health was checked daily by a veterinarian, and mice presenting any sign of illness were excluded from the experiment. Only 3 mice were excluded from the experiment. The cause of exclusion was an infection at the site of the subcutaneous pump.</p>
<p>We used 3 groups of mice in these experiments. These groups were repeated in duplicate to analyze both the ultrafiltration capacity of the peritoneum and the production of cytokines and chemokines. These two measurements were not performed together because they required technical differences during euthanasia. Thereby, the experiments were performed in duplicate, and were repeated at least twice. The control group had a catheter and received no PDF (n = 6). This group was used to demonstrate that a catheter alone does not affect the peritoneal membrane. The PDF group received an instillation of 2 ml of staysafe (4.25% glucose) PDF (Fresenius Medical Care, Germany) daily through the catheter (n = 10). The paricalcitol group received 2 ml of staysafe (4.25% glucose) supplemented with paricalcitol daily (n = 11). The mice were treated for 30 days. At the end of the experiment, the mice were visually checked for the presence of peritoneal infection (signs of pus at the peritoneal cavity), and peritoneal washing fluid from the 3 mouse groups was seeded in agar plates for bacterial culture; no bacterial infection was detected. To study the mechanisms involved in paricalcitol peritoneal protection, we performed only the comparison between the PDF and the paricalcitol groups.</p>
<p>The experimental procedure was performed according to NIH guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and was approved by the institutional ethics committee.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Paricalcitol treatment</title>
<p>Paricalcitol dissolved in PDF was instilled daily into the mouse peritoneal cavity for 30 days, at a dosage of 0.3 µg/kg/week (0.86 ng/mouse/day). The dose used in mice is low considering the translation to humans based on body surface area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-ReaganShaw1">[17]</xref>, which would mean that human patients should receive about 0.024 µg/kg/week, whereas they normally receive 0.117 µg/kg/week.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Histological analyses and immunofluorescence</title>
<p>Parietal peritoneal biopsies were collected from the opposite side of the catheter installation. Part of the biopsies were fixed in Bouin's solution, embedded in paraffin, cut into 5 µm sections and stained with Masson's trichrome. The peritoneal membrane thickness was determined using a microscope (Leica CTR6000, with a Leica Microsystems LAS-AF6000). Microphotographs were obtained using an Olympus BX41 clinical microscope and an Olympus DP20 digital camera using cell acquisition software.</p>
<p>The peritoneal thickness of each mouse was calculated by the median of measurement taken every 50 µm from one extreme to the other of the biopsy. The result was used to calculate the group thickness.</p>
<p>For the immunofluorescence analysis, other biopsies were frozen in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound and cut into 5 µm sections. To identify the mesothelial cells, a mouse anti-cytokeratin 8/18 (clone 5D3 Novocastra, Newcastle, UK) antibody was used, which was stained with anti-IgG1 specific Zenon Fab fragments (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The blood vessels were stained with anti-CD31 and Zenon Fab. The CD45<sup>+</sup> cells were identified using a rat anti-mouse CD45 (BD Bioscience) and were stained with goat anti-rat antibodies. To stain CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells, the same antibodies used in flow cytometry were employed. The nuclei were stained with DAPI. The micrography was performed with a fluorescence microscope (Leica CTR6000, Leica Microsystems Heidelberg, Germany, with LAS-AF6000 software) or with a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SPE with LAS-AF software, version 2.0.1 build 2043).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d">
<title>Net ultrafiltration</title>
<p>On the final day of the experiment, the mice were euthanized 40 minutes after receiving 2 ml of PDF, and the total peritoneal volume was drained and measured.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2e">
<title>Chemokine and cytokine detection</title>
<p>To determine the peritoneal production of cytokines and chemokines, the peritoneal cavity was washed in this case with 2 ml of saline immediately after the mice were euthanized. The molecule concentration is thereby not affected by the differences in ultrafiltration. The solution was centrifuged, and the supernatant was separated into small aliquots and stored at -80°C. The peritoneal chemokines and cytokines were determined using the FlowCytomix technique (Bender MedSystems GmbH).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2f">
<title>Flow cytometry analyses</title>
<p>The peritoneal cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using the following antibodies purchased from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA, USA): anti-mouse CD4 PE, anti-mouse CD3e biotin, anti-mouse CD8a Alexa Fluor 488-labeled and anti-Foxp3 Alexa 647. FoxP3 stainning was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations in the kit “Mouse FoxP3 Buffer set” (BD Pharmingen).</p>
<p>The biotin-conjugated anti-CTLA4 and PE-Cy7-conjugated streptavidin were acquired from eBioscience (San Diego, USA). The flow cytometry analysis was conducted on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using Cell Quest Pro software.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2g">
<title>Determination of IL-17 producing cells</title>
<p>Peritoneal cells from the PDF-treated mice were enriched in T cells by negative selection using magnetic beads coated with monoclonal antibodies against unrelated populations. The elimination of bead linked cells was performed in an autoMACS cell separator (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's instructions. These cells enriched in T lymphocytes were used as the “effector T cell” population. Meanwhile, cells from the PDF or paricalcitol-treated groups were divided and enriched in CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells through negative selection of irrelevant cells to analyze their regulatory capacity. These CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> enriched T cell populations were stained with PKH67 (PKH67 green fluorescent linker; Sigma Aldrich) and cocultured with the enriched T cell population from the PDF-treated mice, at a ratio 1∶1(75×10<sup>3</sup> cells of each population). A negative control without the CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> enriched T cell populations was also analyzed.</p>
<p>The cells were cultured for 2 days in a 96-well plate pre-coated for 24 h at 4°C with anti-CD3 antibody (purified hamster anti-mouse CD3e; BD Biosciences) and activated with anti-CD28 (2 µg/ml) antibody (purified hamster anti-mouse CD28; BD Biosciences). On the final day, the cells were exposed to brefeldin A (2.5 µg/mL) for 12 h, and the expression of intracellular IL-17 was then analyzed by flow cytometry. Finally, the frequency of the IL-17<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from the PKH67<sup><underline>negative</underline></sup> population was determined.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2h">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism (version 4) (La Jolla, CA, USA) software for Macintosh, and the results were presented in box plot graphics. The bottom and top of the box represent the first and third quartiles, and the median is represented by the band inside the box. The ends of the whiskers represent minimum and maximum values. Comparisons between the control and the paricalcitol groups were performed using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. A value of <italic>P</italic>&lt;.05 was considered statistically significant. All the experiments were repeated at least twice. The correlation analysis was performed using Spearman's nonparametric test.</p>

<title>Paricalcitol treatment ameliorated peritoneal inflammation and fibrosis</title>
<p>PDF treatment was shown to induce peritoneal fibrosis in mice. To evaluate the effect of VDR signaling on peritoneal fibrosis, intraperitoneal paricalcitol was administered daily with PDF in an independent group of mice, and the thickness of peritoneal membrane was evaluated as a measure of peritoneal fibrosis. Masson's trichrome staining of the peritoneal biopsies revealed that the paricalcitol group had less matrix deposition and cell infiltration in the peritoneal membrane than the PDF group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108477-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). This was confirmed by a morphometric analysis, which showed thicker peritoneal membranes in the PDF-treated group as compared with the paricalcitol-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108477-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Increased thickness was the consequence of cellular and matrix deposition over the peritoneal membrane.</p>

<p>A) Paraffin sections of the peritoneal membrane from the 3 groups were stained with Masson's trichrome. B) Thickening of the peritoneal membrane was determined by morphometric analysis.

<p>A functional analysis of the peritoneal membranes revealed that the paricalcitol group had better ultrafiltration than the PDF group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108477-g001">Figure 1C, <italic>P</italic></xref>&lt;.05). This result might be the consequence of paricalcitol's effect on inflammation and angiogenesis. In the peritoneal membranes of the PDF group, CD45<sup>+</sup> cells were found on both sides of the mesothelial cell layer, which was not well preserved. The mesothelial cells of the paricalcitol-treated mice were better preserved than in the PDF group, and CD45<sup>+</sup> cells were present in lower numbers and located primarily in the sub-mesothelial space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108477-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the key events in tissue regeneration is angiogenesis at the fibrotic area generating granulose tissue. In PD-treated patients, this is related to ultrafiltration failure. This effect was also found in PDF-treated mice, which presented blood vessels embedded in the inflammatory zone. In addition, these mice had increased numbers of blood vessels in the muscular package at the base of the peritoneal membrane as compared with the control mice. The paricalcitol group had fewer blood vessels at the base and no blood vessels embedded in the inflammatory zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108477-g001">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>

<title>Paricalcitol treatment increased T cell populations in the peritoneal cavity</title>
<p>We next analyzed the phenotype of the leukocytes present within the peritoneal cavity after treatment. The paricalcitol-treated mice tended to have a higher number of nucleated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108477-g002">Figure 2A</xref>); however, the number of B cells in the control group was higher than in the PDF group and similar to that observed in the paricalcitol group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108477-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The PDF- and paricalcitol-treated mice presented a higher number of total macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108477-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), and the number of B cells and macrophages were similar between both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108477-g002">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>, respectively).

<title>Paricalcitol increased the number of T cells expressing a regulatory phenotype in the peritoneal cavity</title>
<p>Vitamin D has previously been associated with the activation and proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T regulatory cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Ghoreishi1">[18]</xref>. Regulatory T cells are characterized by the expression of Forkhead P3 (Foxp3) transcription factor and the membrane antigens cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and TGF-β. These cells are responsible for the regulation of the immune response. The paricalcitol-treated mice tended to have higher frequency of Foxp-3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells than that observed in the PDF group. However, the frequency of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing Foxp-3 was significantly higher in the paricalcitol-treated mice than in the PDF-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108477-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Both the paricalcitol and the PDF groups expressed similar frequencies of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing CTLA-4<sup>+</sup> and membrane TGF-β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108477-g004">Figure 4B and 4C</xref>, respectively), whereas both markers were expressed at higher levels in the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells of the paricalcitol-treated mice than in those of the PDF group. These results clearly show that paricalcitol preferentially improves the frequency of CD8<sup>+</sup> Treg in the peritoneal cavities of mice exposed to PDF. Nonetheless, the absolute number of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T regulatory cells (FoxP3<sup>+</sup>) were higher in animals treated with paricalcitol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108477-g004">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Fibrosis is the final consequence of a chronic inflammatory reaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Darby1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Marra1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Wynn1">[21]</xref>. Therefore, regulation of the inflammatory reaction could have beneficial effects on fibrotic disorders. VDR signaling has previously been shown to regulate inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Ghoreishi1">[18]</xref> and has shown fibroprotective activity in various organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Lee1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Meems1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Zhang2">[24]</xref>. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the role of VDR signaling in fibrosis regulation, but it is still poorly understood. The activation of this pathway has been shown to inhibit myofibroblast activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Li1">[25]</xref>, to induce differentiation of mesenchymal precursors into a non-fibrogenic phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Artaza1">[26]</xref> and to reduce inflammation through NF-κB sequestration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Tan1">[16]</xref>. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and might work together.</p>
<p>Inflammation is a key event in wound healing and fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Martin1">[27]</xref>. It is known that macrophages play an important role in the fibrotic process through the secretion of growth factors such as TGF-β and FGF. Here we addressed the role of paricalcitol in the development of fibrosis using a mouse model of peritoneal dialysis. Given that inflammation plays an important role in fibrosis, we centered our attention on the inflammatory mechanisms.</p>
<p>As previously reported by our group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Aroeira1">[8]</xref>, peritoneal exposure to PDF induced increased numbers of inflammatory cells at the peritoneal cavity, composed primarily of macrophages. However, the number of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the peritoneal cavity of mice exposed to PDF increased as well. T cells are responsible for the orchestration of inflammatory responses through the secretion of cytokines, which also play a role in fibrosis by the activation of fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Doucet1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Theiss1">[29]</xref> and fibrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Shao1">[30]</xref>. Th2 responses are associated with fibrosis development, whereas Th1 responses are associated with anti-fibrotic actions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Marra1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Hirata1">[31]</xref>. However, Th1 type responses have also been implicated in peritoneal fibrotic adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Tzianabos1">[32]</xref> and autoimmune-induced cardiac fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Daniels1">[33]</xref>, whereas Th17 responses have been related to fibrosis in the kidneys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Faust1">[34]</xref>, lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Simonian1">[35]</xref> and skin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Zhang3">[36]</xref>. We have recently demonstrated that IL-17 plays an important role in the generation of PDF-induced peritoneal fibrosis in patients and mice exposed to PDF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-RodriguesDiez1">[37]</xref>. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were the primary source of IL-17 in the peritoneum of the mice treated with PDF. We have also demonstrated that the direct administration of recombinant IL17 in the peritoneum induced peritoneal fibrosis in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-RodriguesDiez1">[37]</xref>. These results reveal that, depending on the model studied, different T cell phenotypes appear to be potentially fibrogenic.</p>
<p>Several studies have assessed the cytokine pattern produced in the peritoneal cavity of patients undergoing PD, with conflicting results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Roberts1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Yokoyama1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Zamauskaite1">[40]</xref>. The discrepancy in these results could be explained by the <italic>in vitro</italic> experimental approaches used. The PD mouse model, contrary to expectations, revealed an upregulation of all Th responses. This could be explained by the fact that approaches using <italic>in vitro</italic> cell stimulation might induce biases in cytokine production depending on the methodology used, whereas for the PD mouse model, cytokines are produced <italic>in vivo</italic> in response to PDF instillation.</p>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that VDR activation induces an increased frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Ghoreishi1">[18]</xref>. In this study, paricalcitol treatment tended to increase the frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing Foxp3 (<italic>P</italic> = .054), whereas the impact on the expression of other Treg markers was less important. The treatment with paricalcitol, however, increased the frequency of peritoneal CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing Foxp-3, CTLA-4 and membrane TGF-β. These results suggest that, at least in this model, VDR signaling preferentially affects CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. This selective effect on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells could be explained by the fact that mature CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells express higher concentrations of VDR than CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Deluca1">[41]</xref>. To our knowledge, this was the first time that a preferential effect on the activation/development of regulatory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was demonstrated <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108477-g003">Figure 3</xref>, the number of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is higher in paricalcitol-treated mice than in PDF mice. As a result of the increased number of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in paricalcitol and the tendency towards and increased frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing Foxp3, the number of peritoneal CD4<sup>+</sup> Treg cells was higher in paricalcitol than in PDF treated mice (P&lt;.001). Similarly, the number of peritoneal CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing Foxp3 was higher in paricalcitol-treated than in PDF mice. This outcome strongly suggests that the increased number of regulatory T cells is responsible for inflammation regulation in the peritoneal cavity.</p>
<p>The majority of studies concerning T cell-mediated regulation of immune response have been focused on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. The existence of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with regulatory activity (called “suppressor” cells) was demonstrated during the 1970s and 1980s, however, the study of these cells was hindered by technical limitations. The interest in CD8<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells has recently been revived, and increasing evidence points to their participation in the control of various inflammatory processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Pomie1">[42]</xref> through the regulation of IL-17 and IFN-γ. The results presented here show that paricalcitol treatment selectively reduced IL-17 peritoneal concentration. The regulation of IL-17 production was likely mediated by both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from paricalcitol-treated mice. Although the frequencies of CD4<sup>+</sup> T reg (CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup>) from paricalcitol were no higher than in the PDF group (<italic>P</italic> = .054), the absolute number of CD4<sup>+</sup> Treg were significantly increased and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from paricalcitol-treated mice appear to play a role in the prevention of PDF-induced fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108477-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In addition, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from the paricalcitol-treated mice, but not those from PDF mice, were able to reduce the frequency of IL-17<sup>+</sup> T cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108477-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This result clearly demonstrates that both, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are able to regulate IL-17 production <italic>in vitro</italic>. The effect on IL-17 strongly correlated with decreased peritoneal fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-RodriguesDiez1">[37]</xref>. However, given that regulatory T cells and IL-17-secreting cells appear to have a common precursor, it does not exclude the possibility that, <italic>in vivo</italic>, VDR signaling could stimulate the differentiation into a regulatory T cell phenotype to the detriment of the Th17<sup>+</sup> T cells. We cannot rule out the possibility that these mechanisms are working together.</p>
<p>VDR signaling has previously been related to fibroprotective activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Li1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Artaza1">[26]</xref>. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the role of VDR signaling in fibrosis regulation, but it is still poorly understood. This study demonstrated that paricalcitol administered intraperitoneally reduced peritoneal membrane inflammation and fibrosis. The mechanism appears to be dependent primarily on the activation of Treg cells and the reduction of IL-17 secretion. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and might work simultaneously.</p>
<p>VDR is also expressed in macrophages, which could play a role in peritoneal fibrosis. Macrophages are the largest cell population in the peritoneal cavity. VDR signaling promotes macrophage differentiation into the M2 phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Martinez1">[43]</xref>, which, as previously demonstrated, is related to peritoneal fibrosis in PD-treated patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108477-Bellon1">[44]</xref>. In addition, the levels of TGF-β in the peritoneal cavity of the mice treated with paricalcitol were no different than those of the mice treated with PDF alone, and there was no correlation with peritoneal fibrosis. It has been suggested that the fibrotic activity of TGF-β is regulated by IL-17 and that inflammation-induced fibrosis could be prevented by targeting IL-17 [3434]. Therefore, at least in our model of PD-treated mice, the evidence suggests that VDR signaling in macrophages might not play a role in the prevention of peritoneal fibrosis.</p>
<p>Further studies will be required to elucidate other immunological mechanisms involved in peritoneal fibrosis. However, the results presented here strongly suggest that VDR signaling reduces peritoneal fibrosis through the augment of the number Treg and the downregulation of IL-17 production at peritoneum.</p>
</sec><sec id="s5">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>VDR signaling promotes the recruitment of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with regulatory activity into the peritoneal cavity, increasing their number, reducing IL-17 production and diminishing PDF-induced peritoneal inflammation and fibrosis. VDR signaling could be used to reduce peritoneal fibrosis induced by chronic exposure to PDF as well as surgery-induced adhesion.</p>
