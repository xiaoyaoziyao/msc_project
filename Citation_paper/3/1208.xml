          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Measurement of partial pressure of oxygen (P<sub>O2</sub>) at high temporal resolution remains a technological challenge. This study introduces a novel P<sub>O2</sub> sensing technology based on Multi-Frequency Phase Fluorimetry (MFPF). The aim was to validate MFPF against polarographic Clark-type electrode (CTE) P<sub>O2</sub> measurements.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>MFPF technology was first investigated in N = 8 anaesthetised pigs at F<sub>IO2</sub> of 0.21, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0. At each F<sub>IO2</sub> level, blood samples were withdrawn and P<sub>O2</sub> was measured <italic>in vitro</italic> with MFPF using two FOXY-AL300 probes immediately followed by CTE measurement. Secondly, MFPF-P<sub>O2</sub> readings were compared to CTE in an artificial circulatory setup (human packed red blood cells, haematocrit of 30%). The impacts of temperature (20, 30, 40°C) and blood flow (0.8, 1.6, 2.4, 3.2, 4.0 L min<sup>−1</sup>) on MFPF-P<sub>O2</sub> measurements were assessed. MFPF response time in the gas- and blood-phase was determined. Porcine MFPF-P<sub>O2</sub> ranged from 63 to 749 mmHg; the corresponding CTE samples from 43 to 712 mmHg. Linear regression: CTE = 15.59+1.18*MFPF (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.93; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001). Bland Altman analysis: mean<sub>diff</sub> 69.2 mmHg, range<sub>diff</sub> -50.1/215.6 mmHg, 1.96-SD limits -56.3/194.8 mmHg. In artificial circulatory setup, MFPF-P<sub>O2</sub> ranged from 20 to 567 mmHg and CTE samples from 11 to 575 mmHg. Linear regression: CTE = −8.73+1.05*MFPF (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001). Bland-Altman analysis: mean<sub>diff</sub> 6.6 mmHg, range<sub>diff</sub> -9.7/20.5 mmHg, 1.96-SD limits -12.7/25.8 mmHg. Differences between MFPF and CTE-P<sub>O2</sub> due to variations of temperature were less than 6 mmHg (range 0–140 mmHg) and less than 35 mmHg (range 140–750 mmHg); differences due to variations in blood flow were less than 15 mmHg (all <italic>P</italic>-values&gt;0.05). MFPF response-time (monoexponential) was 1.48±0.26 s for the gas-phase and 1.51±0.20 s for the blood-phase.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
          <p>MFPF-derived P<sub>O2</sub> readings were reproducible and showed excellent correlation and good agreement with Clark-type electrode-based P<sub>O2</sub> measurements. There was no relevant impact of temperature and blood flow upon MFPF-P<sub>O2</sub> measurements. The response time of the MFPF FOXY-AL300 probe was adequate for real-time sensing in the blood phase.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The polarographic Clark-type electrode remains the gold standard for oxygen partial pressure (P<sub>O2</sub>) measurement to date, and is the underlying electrochemical principle of conventional blood gas P<sub>O2</sub> analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060591-Clark1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060591-Severinghaus1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060591-Hahn1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060591-Kimmich1">[4]</xref>. Moreover, polarographic P<sub>O2</sub> probes, such as the Licox probe, are used for the continuous monitoring of oxygen. These probes provide favourable properties, including high accuracy and stability; however, they lack high temporal resolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060591-Hoelper1">[5]</xref>. Several publications reveal that oxygen levels may largely fluctuate over time in the systemic (e.g., thoracic aorta) or capillary circulation (e.g. vasomotion, brain resting state) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060591-Purves1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060591-Williams1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060591-Zaugg1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060591-Baumgardner1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060591-Hartmann1">[10]</xref> due to oxygen consumption and delivery. Therefore, novel, fast oxygen-sensing technologies are required for the investigation of these physiologic or pathophysiologic phenomena <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060591-Ganter1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060591-Mahutte1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Recently, a novel technology for fast oxygen sensing based on Multi Frequency Phase Fluorimetry (MFPF), termed NeoFox® (OceanOptics, Dunedin, USA; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oceanoptics.com" xlink:type="simple">www.oceanoptics.com</ext-link>), was released. This technology is suitable for 10 Hz oxygen measurements using fluorescent dye sensors such as the FOXY-AL300 (OceanOptics, Dunedin, USA). This indwelling, uncoated ruthenium tipped fibre optic probe allows for rapid measurement of oxygen within blood or tissue. The technology, however, has not yet been compared to conventional polarographic Clark-type electrode (CTE)-based P<sub>O2</sub> measurements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060591-Klein1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060591-Herweling1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>This study aimed to validate MFPF-P<sub>O2</sub> measurements versus CTE-based measurements of oxygen partial pressure. Firstly, in a porcine lung model, MFPF-P<sub>O2</sub> was measured <italic>in vitro</italic> without the interference of blood flow using two FOXY-AL300 probes (OceanOptics, Dunedin, USA) and was then compared to CTE blood gas P<sub>O2</sub> analysis. Secondly, for further validation, we developed an artificial extracorporeal circulation setup primed with a mixture of crystalloid, colloid and human packed red cells to imitate <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions. In this setup, MFPF-P<sub>O2</sub> readings were assessed and then compared to conventionally measured P<sub>O2</sub> by CTE. Furthermore, in the artificial circulation setup, temperature and blood flow were randomly varied in order to evaluate their impact on MFPF-P<sub>O2</sub> measurements. In addition, MFPF FOXY-AL300 (OceanOptics, Dunedin, USA) probe response times were determined in the gas- and blood-phases to further assess this novel technology. In summary, the overall aim could be achieved.</p>

        <title>MFPF Technological Principle</title>
        <p>The MFPF platform (NeoFox®, OceanOptics, Dundin, USA) was mounted with the indwelling FOXY-AL300 (OceanOptics, Dunedin, USA) aluminium-jacketed optical fibre probe (500 µm outer and 300 µm core diameter) with an uncoated ruthenium complex at the tip to assess luminescence lifetime in the region surrounding the fluorescent dye, which was roughly equal to the fibre-optic tip surface area (about 0.3 mm<sup>2</sup>). MFPF assesses luminescence lifetime by modulation of light excitation frequency where the oxygen dependent phase shift of the emission is detected. Lifetime is related to phase shift by the equation:<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0060591.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where τ is calculated lifetime in s, f is LED modulation frequency in Hz, and θ is phase shift measured by the instrument. The signals are transmitted via connected glass fibre cable to the MFPF server (NeoFox®, OceanOptics, Dundin, USA) with an integrated light emitting diode, as well as temperature and atmospheric pressure transducers. An external thermistor probe compensates for temperature changes (once a multi-point temperature calibration is performed). Lifetime data were logged by NeoFox® Software (OceanOptics, Dunedin, USA) for calculation of absolute P<sub>O2</sub> values. Absolute P<sub>O2</sub> values, luminescence phase shift, luminescence intensity, temperature and ambient pressure were displayed at a digital sampling rate of 10 Hz.</p>

The chamber was purged with pure nitrogen (P<sub>O2</sub> = 0 mmHg), compressed air (P<sub>O2</sub> = 158 mmHg) and pure oxygen (P<sub>O2</sub> = 750 mmHg), respectively, in consideration of atmospheric pressure with a fixed laminar flow of 2 L min<sup>−1</sup> at 20, 30 and 40°C. After stabilisation, the corresponding lifetimes were used to create a multi-temperature calibration table.</p>

        <title>MFPF Validation <italic>in vitro</italic> using a porcine lung model</title>
        <p>Eight piglets, <italic>Sus scrofa domestica</italic> (20±2 kg), were investigated. After the induction of anaesthesia with a bolus of fentanyl 5 µg kg<sup>−1</sup> i.v., propofol 2 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> i.v. and single shot atracurium 0.5 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> i.v. via an ear vein, the pigs were orotreachally intubated (ID 8.0 mm cuffed tubing) and ventilated in pressure-controlled mode (AVEA, Viasis Healthcare, Höchberg, Germany). Vascular access was achieved by surgical cut down for the placement of an arterial blood pressure line in the femoral artery. Normocapnia (P<sub>aCO2</sub> 35–45 mmHg) was maintained with a tidal volume of 6–8 ml kg<sup>−1</sup> BW<sup>−1</sup>. Anaesthesia was maintained by continuous infusion of fentanyl (5 µg<sup>−1</sup> kg<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> i.v.) and propofol (5–10 mg<sup>−1</sup> kg<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> i.v.). During the experiment, F<sub>IO2</sub> was adjusted (0.21, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0) to obtain P<sub>O2</sub> readings over the whole normobaric measurement range. Core temperature by rectal probe was maintained within the physiologic range (37.0–38.5°C) using a heating blanket.</p>
        <p>Blood samples (10 ml each) were withdrawn at each F<sub>IO2</sub> level into heparinised gas tight syringes covered with opaque tape. For each sample, the tips of two FOXY-AL300 probes (OceanOptics, Dunedin, USA) were placed into the syringe outlet sealed with a rubber port to avoid air contact. After reaching steady state values, both MFPF-P<sub>O2</sub> readings were simultaneously recorded for 2 min using the corresponding animal core temperature for the measurement. Then, the same blood sample was analysed by conventional polarographic Clark-type electrodes (RapidLab 415, BayerHealthcare, Leverkusen) immediately afterwards.</p>

        <p>In order to provide standardised conditions and to simulate <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions, an artificial circulatory system was set up. The apparatus was built of: a) two oxygenators (Jostra Quadrox D, Maquet Cardiopulmonary AG, Hirrlingen, Germany), b) 3/8 inch silicon tubing (Fumedica, Muri, Switzerland) with 3/8–3/8 inch connecting pieces (Luerlock, Fumedica, Muri, Switzerland), c) two multi-flow roller pumps (Stöckert, Munich, Germany), d) a heat exchanger (HCU-30, Maquet Cardiopulmonary AG, Hirrlingen, Germany) and e) an ambient light protected measurement chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060591-g001">Figure 1</xref>). A switch valve between two independent closed circuits enabled the induction of a step change between highly oxygenated blood (F<sub>IO2</sub> 1.0, circuit 1) to oxygen free blood (F<sub>IO2</sub> 0.0, circuit 2) in order to assess the time constants of the FOXY-AL300 probes in blood-phase.</p>

            <p>Artificial circulatory setup with two independent circuits filled with human packed red blood cells (haematocrit of 30%). A switching valve between the circuits enabled a step-change between highly oxygenated (circuit 1: purged with pure oxygen) and oxygen free blood (circuit 2: purged with nitrogen). Black arrows represent direction of blood flow. Adapting the settings of the rollerpumps and the heating-cooling device (heat exchanger) allowed blood-flow and temperature to be controlled. Via the O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> blenders, oxygen content could be adapted at fixed sweep gas flow over the oxygenators. Measurement chamber contained 1.) ports for insertion of MFPF probes (Foxy-AL 300); 2.) a temperature probe and 3.) a sampling port for Clark-typed based (CTE) P<sub>O2</sub> analysis (ABL 700).</p>

In addition, linear regression analysis of difference versus mean was performed and then tested, if the slope is significantly different from zero.

To test the influence of blood flow and temperature variation, a multiple linear regression model was fitted: magnitude of P<sub>O2</sub> measurements [(CTE+MFPF)/2], temperature and blood flow as independent variables; differences of MFPF and CTE as dependent variable. The categories of temperature and blood flow were handled with dummy coding.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Findings demonstrate MFPF technologýs capacity for detecting changes in P<sub>O2</sub> compared to Clark-type electrode (CTE) based P<sub>O2</sub> measurements. For discrete samples, <italic>in vitro</italic> porcine blood phase measurements (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.93) did not give very tight limits of agreement. However, this study was not designed to validate MFPF as replacement for traditional <italic>in vitro</italic> blood gas analysis. For such a setup, we would have needed a configuration where the sensor and sample are part of a heated block with very tight control of both probe and blood sample temperature. The authors want to point out that the real application of MFPF is for flowing blood when the probe is placed <italic>in vivo</italic> - which was investigated by <italic>ex vivo</italic> measurements in an artificial circulatory setup filled with human blood. These findings demonstrate that MFPF technology provides high accuracy for P<sub>O2</sub> measurements compared to CTE based P<sub>O2</sub> measurements (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99). The <italic>ex vivo</italic> measurements showed that MFPF technology accurately compensates for variation in temperature and that P<sub>O2</sub> measurements are not affected by variation in blood flow. MFPF response time in combination with the indwelling FOXY-AL300 probes was 1.48±0.26 s in the gas-phase and 1.51±0.20 s in the blood-phase (step-change from pure oxygen to pure nitrogen).</p>
      <p>In summary, MFPF technology allows for fast, accurate and valid P<sub>O2</sub> readings over the normobaric P<sub>O2</sub> range (0–749 mmHg) for <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiments, as MFPF P<sub>O2</sub> measurements ranged between 11 and 749 mmHg. This fact is the most important, as novel oxygen sensing technologies should be validated over the whole measurement range.</p>
      <p>The <italic>in vitro</italic> animal model (porcine blood) showed good correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.93), although the data was determined in clusters of oxygen concentration (F<sub>IO2</sub> 0.21, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0). The observed high bias with positive drift as well as the enlarged standard deviation can be most likely explained by the systemic experimental error to use the animals' core temperature for the <italic>in vitro</italic> measurements. The main intention of this first series was to obtain readings without the influence of blood flow. Therefore, we focused on how to avoid air contact to the withdrawn blood and decided not to insert the temperature probe into the syringes. However, we did not expect such an impact of temperature, which presumably seems even more evident at high P<sub>O2</sub>-levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060591-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This finding can be explained by the underlying MFPF technology, as in fluorescent quenching, signal intensity increases at lower P<sub>O2</sub> values. To fully understand the observed discrepancy of the <italic>in vitro</italic> (porcine blood) and <italic>ex vivo</italic> (human blood) results, we evaluated the difference of animal core temperature and blood temperature in the syringes two minutes after withdrawal post hoc in one further animal and found an error range of 0.9 to 1.6°C in ten repeated measures. Nevertheless, in the interesting physiologically hypoxic and normoxic (0–140 mmHg) P<sub>O2</sub> range, porcine results show that MFPF technology provides good agreement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060591-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) for discrete samples, although in our setup the technique was less accurate for high P<sub>O2</sub> values. Due to the underlying technological principle precision of MFPF, P<sub>O2</sub> values should increase within this physiologically interesting range (0–140 mmHg), which is supported by the present data. Thus, it seems unlikely that MFPF technology characteristics were responsible for this discrepancy, as intra-class correlation between the MFPF probes was extremely high (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99) in porcine setup and MFPF measurements in the artificial circulatory setup (human blood) showed excellent agreement to CTE, even at high P<sub>O2</sub> levels. From our point of view, the porcine results nicely demonstrate the high temperature sensitivity of MFPF measurements and further highlight the importance of correct temperature acquisition. Instead of repeating this series, we decided to develop a new artificial circulatory system for further validation, where we could also investigate the influence of temperature and blood flow by standardised variation of these physiological values.</p>
      <p>Under <italic>ex vivo</italic> conditions in the artificial circulatory setup (human blood), we found excellent correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99) of MFPF and CTE P<sub>O2</sub> with measurements equally distributed over the entire normobaric range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060591-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In general, MFPF values were slightly lower in comparison to CTE values. These findings were unexpected, as the MFPF technology, unlike polarography, does not consume any oxygen. These results might be explained by the fact that the blood-gas-analysers used allow a potential bias of 5% in calibration drift and it is well known that these are not really linear over the entire range. This underestimation decreases with lowered P<sub>O2</sub> values and is therefore of limited clinical importance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060591-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060591-g003">3</xref>).</p>
      <p>In general and as demonstrated by porcine results, temperature is obviously one major confounder on P<sub>O2</sub> measurement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060591-Picandet1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060591-Madiedo1">[21]</xref>. However, the present results of the artificial circulatory setup show that the MFPF technology accurately compensates for alterations in temperature if assessed strictly at the measurement site. This fact highlights the efficiency of multi-temperature compensation performed by MFPF software between 20 and 40°C. In this context, it would be desirable to have sensors available with an integrated temperature thermistor to prevent errors such as temperature probe misplacement. In addition to temperature, blood flow may influence P<sub>O2</sub> measurements of an indwelling sensor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060591-Grundmann1">[22]</xref>. The present <italic>ex vivo</italic> results confirm that MFPF technology correctly measures P<sub>O2</sub>, even under variations of blood flow within the range of 0.8 to 4.0 L min<sup>−1</sup>.</p>
      <p>One major advantage of MFPF P<sub>O2</sub> readings, next to high agreement and reproducibility, is high temporal resolution. We measured the monoexponential time constant for a step change in P<sub>O2</sub> at 1.5 s in blood. In contrast, the polagraphic Licox probe showed response times up to several min <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060591-Hoelper1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060591-Haitsma1">[23]</xref>. Recently, faster P<sub>O2</sub> probes, such as the Neurovent PTO probe based on the fluorescent quenching of oxygen, have been presented. Although these probes reported higher response times (30 – 120 s), none of the commercially available technologies come near the temporal resolution of the uncoated ruthenium probe used in the current study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060591-Haitsma1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060591-Citerio1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060591-Huschak1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060591-Jaeger1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060591-Orakcioglu1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060591-Stewart1">[28]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The MFPF system is easy to set up and needs no complex calibration. In this validation study, the FOXY-AL300 probes were individually calibrated to minimise for potential errors, but in less demanding use, a calibration file supplied by the manufacturer for each probe can be used with acceptable accuracy. Furthermore, phase shift is not influenced by the medium the oxygen sensor is placed in, allowing simplified calibration in gas phase. Moreover, phase shift measurement is not influenced by the probe indicator dye concentration, photo bleaching of dye, or excitation source intensity. This results in stable signals with high signal to noise ratio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060591-Lakowicz1">[29]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, we could not obtain readings in a clinical setting in patients, as the indwelling probes available up to now (e.g. the FOXY AL-300) are not licensed for human application. Therefore, we investigated the MFPF technology <italic>ex vivo</italic> in a self-built artificial circulatory system filled with human blood. Although ruthenium-based dyes are commonly used in biological monitoring applications and are thought to be non-toxic, for future application in humans, the metallic surface of the probe and its tip containing ruthenium need to be coated with silicone or Teflon®. In contrast to a silicone probe coating, Teflon® would allow for more rapid diffusion of oxygen and thereby maintain ultrafast probe response time. The challenge for the sensor engineering community will be to avoid direct contact of the fluorescent dye to blood components. Also, it is necessary to avoid protein absorption and blood clotting to maintain signal stability and accuracy. Therefore, an intensive research effort is still necessary, but if engineering is to advance from laboratory-based research to commercial production levels, the MFPF technique could provide clinicians with an effective tool.</p>
      <p>A limitation of the study is that we did not explicitly investigate the measurement stability over time. However, the present findings showed no calibration drift of the probes.</p>
      <p>In summary we conclude that <italic>ex vivo</italic> MFPF-P<sub>O2</sub> readings are reproducible, and show excellent correlation and high agreement with the gold standard Clark-type electrode (CTE)-based P<sub>O2</sub> analysis. This novel technology adequately compensates for changes in temperature and allows for accurate measurements at various blood flow states. This feasible, accurate and easy to calibrate method has the potential to dynamically follow changes in blood oxygenation under various physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions with a high temporal resolution.</p>
