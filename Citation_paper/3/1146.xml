<title>Background and Aim</title>
<p>Prognostic markers are important for predicting the progression and staging of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Ezrin (EZR) and Podocalyxin (PODXL) are proteins associated with invasion, migration and poor prognosis in various types of cancer. Recently, it has been observed that chloride intracellular channel 5 (CLIC5) forms a complex with EZR and PODXL and that it is required for podocyte structure and function. In this study, we evaluated the overexpression of EZR, PODXL and CLIC5 in HCC.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The modified resistant hepatocyte model (MRHR), human biopsies and HCC cell lines (HepG2, Huh7 and SNU387) were used in this study. Gene and protein expression levels were evaluated in the MRHR by qRT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses, and protein expression in the human biopsies was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Protein expression in the HCC cell lines was evaluated by immunofluorescence and Western blot, also the migration and invasive abilities of Huh7 cells were evaluated using shRNA-mediated inhibition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Our results indicated that these genes and proteins were overexpressed in HCC. Moreover, when the expression of CLIC5 and PODXL was inhibited in Huh7 cells, we observed decreased migration and invasion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec004">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study suggested that EZR, CLIC5 and PODXL could be biological markers to predict the prognosis of HCC and that these proteins participate in migration and invasion processes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Invasion is a critical step in the development of metastasis, which is characterized by changes in the expression of proteins related to the cytoskeleton, migration, and invasion [<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Several cell membrane and cytoskeleton-related proteins are overexpressed in many types of cancers, including Ezrin (EZR) [<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and Podocalyxin (PODXL) [<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], which are associated with morphogenesis and migration because they function as scaffold proteins between the cell membrane and actin cytoskeleton [<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131605.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. EZR and PODXL are also overexpressed in various tumors [<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and their co-expression enhances the metastatic potential of cell lines and tumors [<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131605.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Chloride intracellular channel 5 (CLIC5) is an actin-associated protein involved in cell projections of placental microvilli [<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], inner ear hair cells [<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and podocytes [<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Recently, it has been observed that CLIC5 forms a complex with EZR and PODXL that is required for podocyte structure and function [<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
<p>Hepatocellular cancer (HCC) has high mortality because patients are asymptomatic until the cancer is so advanced that the tumor cannot be treated with radical hepatectomy and traditional therapy (chemotherapy and radiotherapy). Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify new and effective molecular markers for diagnosis and prognosis prediction and to find new molecular therapeutic targets for HCC patients [<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Although CLIC5 has not been reported to be involved in hepatocellular carcinogenesis, it has been proposed as a metastatic risk marker due to its overexpression in breast tumors and rectal tumors after radiotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131605.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Members of the CLIC family (CLIC1 and CLIC4) are associated with proliferation, angiogenesis, drug resistance, invasion, metastasis and poor prognosis [<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In this study, we examined the expression of EZR, CLIC5 and PODXL at the mRNA and protein levels in a modified hepatocyte resistant model (MHRM) and in cases of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Additionally, we studied for the first time the roles of CLIC5 and PODXL in HCC cell line migration and invasion.</p>

<title>Animals and treatments</title>
<p>All experiments were performed in accordance and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee named “Comité Interno para el Cuidado y Uso de Animales de Laboratorio (CICUAL)” under protocol No. 0001–02. Male Fischer 344 rats were acquired from the Unit for Production of Experimental Laboratory Animals (UPEAL Cinvestav, Mexico City, Mexico) and were given free access to food (PMI Feeds Inc., Laboratory Diet) and water, and they were maintained in a holding room under controlled conditions with a 12 h light/dark cycle, 50% relative humidity, and a temperature of 21°C. Male Fischer 344 rats weighing 180–200 g were subjected to a previously reported carcinogen treatment: briefly, rats were initiated with an intraperitoneal dose of DEN (200 mg/kg; Sigma-Aldrich), the administration of 2-AFF (25 mg/kg) was in three consecutive days, beginning on day 7 after initiation. On day 10, rats were subjected to parcial hepatectomy (HP) [<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Animals of each group (n = 4); experimental and control groups, were sacrificed at 9, 12 and 18 months, and their livers were excised and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). A section was cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen for RNA and protein extraction, and additional sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and processed for routine histological examination.

<sec id="sec012">
<title>RNA isolation and qRT-PCR</title>
<p>Total RNA was isolated from nodular, tumor and non-tumor areas of liver tissue using TriPure Isolation Reagent (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA synthesis was performed with 1 μg of purified RNA and 1 μL of Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). The expression levels of the target genes EZR, PODXL and CLIC5 were measured by qRT-PCR amplification performed using the TaqMan Gene Expression Assay in a Step One Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The 18s rRNA (Rn18s) gene was used as an internal control. The PCR conditions were 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 10 min and 40 cycles at 95°C for 1 sec followed by 60°C 1 min. The relative expression levels were calculated using the 2<sup>-ΔΔCt</sup> method.</p>

<sec id="sec013">
<title>Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis</title>
<p>For protein isolation, samples from nodular, tumor and non-tumor areas were lysed in buffer containing Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Applied Science, Manheim, Germany) and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany). Protein extract was obtained from cells using lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. For immunoprecipitation assays, cells were lysed using the Pierce Co-IP kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, USA), incubated with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies and detected using the ImmunoCruz Western Blotting Luminol Reagent (Santa Cruz, USA). Densitometry analysis was performed with ImageJ software.</p>

<title>EZR, CLIC5 and PODXL are highly expressed in rat liver tumors</title>
<p>As we reported previously, the carcinogen treatment in MHRM produced nodules and tumors in rats after 9, 12 and 18 months; the experimental group developed nodules and tumors (4/4 rats) and the control group did not present tumors (0/4 rats) [<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] (<xref rid="pone.0131605.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). The nodular (dotted arrow) and tumor areas (solid arrow) in the liver exhibited GGT activity (GGT+), whereas normal hepatocytes did not (GGT-) (<xref rid="pone.0131605.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). To analyze the liver expression of EZR, CLIC5 and PODXL, we isolated GGT+ or GGT- areas for mRNA extraction and then subjected the mRNA to qRT-PCR. Overexpression of EZR, CLIC5 and PODXL genes was observed in nodular (N) and tumor (T) areas but not in non-tumor (NT) areas and controls (C). For EZR and PODXL, the highest relative expression was in tumor areas at 18 months, with values of 4.51 (p&lt;0.002) for EZR and 3.72 (p&lt;0.03) for PODXL. CLIC5 showed high relative expression at 9 months, with a value of 41.27 (p&lt;0.002), and at 12 months, with a value of 43.97 (p&lt;0.002), but was only 5.43 (p&lt;0.05) at 18 months (<xref rid="pone.0131605.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>), although such a large CLIC5 overexpression is no observed in 18mT compared to 9mT and 12mT; it remains higher compared to 18m control. The protein expression levels of EZR, CLIC5 and PODXL were higher in nodular and tumor areas compared to non-tumor areas or controls (p&lt;0.05), which correlated with the qRT-PCR results (<xref rid="pone.0131605.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>).</p>

<title>EZR, CLIC5 and PODXL co-localize in tumor regions</title>
<p>We analyzed EZR, CLIC5 and PODXL expression by immunohistochemistry (<xref rid="pone.0131605.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Using GSTP as a marker for neoplastic lesions and tumors areas [<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], EZR, CLIC5 and PODXL expression was co-localized within the tumor region of serial samples of rat liver tumors after 9, 12 and 18 months of treatment (<xref rid="pone.0131605.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). In tumor regions, EZR expression was observed in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes, but EZR was not expressed in non-tumor regions; cells in the sinusoidal space did express EZR. Similarly, EZR expression was found in cells of the sinusoidal space in livers from non-treated rats. CLIC5 was detected in the cytoplasm of tumor region hepatocytes but was not expressed in controls and was only weakly expressed in non-tumor regions of livers from treated rats. PODXL was detected in the cytoplasm of tumor-region hepatocytes from treated rats, whereas PODXL expression was clearly nuclear in control livers. Interestingly, in non-tumor regions of livers from treated rats, PODXL was weakly observed in hepatocyte nuclei (<xref rid="pone.0131605.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Weak signals of EZR and CLIC5 were detected in the nodular regions of some livers from treated rats, though a clear PODXL signal was always observed in these regions (<xref rid="pone.0131605.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>).

<title>CLIC5 interacts with PODXL and EZR</title>
<p>Because we observed that the three proteins co-localized in tumor regions, the interaction of these proteins was evaluated in 18-month tumors by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. CLIC5 was detected when proteins were immunoprecipitated using either anti-EZR or anti-PODXL antibodies. However, EZR and PODXL were detected only when the complex was immunoprecipitated using an anti-CLIC5 antibody (<xref rid="pone.0131605.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>

<title>EZR, CLIC5 and PODXL are expressed in human HCC</title>
<p>Using immunohistochemistry and normal cervix as a negative control (NC), we found that EZR was positive in 5 of 9 HCC biopsies, with 55% exhibiting medium intensity and 44.44% negative. CLIC5 was positive in 9 of 9 HCC biopsies, with 56% staining with high intensity, 11% with medium intensity and 33% low with intensity. Finally, PODXL was positive in 7 of 9 cases, with 44.44% exhibiting high intensity, 11.11% medium intensity, 22% low intensity and 22% negative.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although the clinical staging system for HCC is implemented, there is a need to refine and complement this system with outcome predictions. New biomarkers will improve the prognostic assessment of HCC patients, and we hypothesized that EZR, CLIC5 and PODXL can serve as HCC biomarkers because they participate in HCC cell migration and invasion.</p>
<p>EZR, CLIC5 and PODXL are present in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes in liver tumors from rats and human HCC biopsies. Our study is the first to report overexpression of CLIC5 and PODXL in tumors in addition to their co-localization with EZR. Previous studies have reported EZR or PODXL overexpression in different tumors [<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], indicating their participation in tumor progression. EZR and PODXL were immunoprecipitated using an anti-CLIC5 antibody, which suggests that CLIC5 could be a scaffold protein between EZR and PODXL in hepatic rat tumors. The function of CLIC5 is proposed to be similar to that of EBP50, which is responsible for the interaction between EZR and PODXL in renal carcinoma [<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In breast cancer cells, the co-expression and interaction of EZR and PODXL increases the metastatic potential of the cells.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in control livers, EZR, CLIC5 and PODXL did not co-localize because EZR and CLIC5 are not expressed in normal hepatocytes. EZR was expressed in the cytoplasm of sinusoidal space cells, such as Kupffer cells, lymphocytes and bile ducts cells, but not in hepatocytes, consistent with previous reports [<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131605.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131605.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In untreated rats, PODXL is expressed in the nuclei of hepatocytes and in the nuclei of A-431, U-251 and U2OS cells, but the report describing these results provided no explanation for this phenomenon [<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>
<p>Currently, there are no reports of CLIC5 expression in the liver under pathological conditions, thus making ours the first observation of this effect. Using GSTP staining to identify preneoplastic lesions and by serial immunohistological analysis, we localized the expression of EZR and CLIC5 in preneoplastic lesions in only certain hepatocytes. We hypothesize that such hepatocytes may be those that eventually form the tumor. Our data demonstrated that EZR, CLIC5 and PODXL co-localization in the liver only occurs under the studied pathological conditions, suggesting that these proteins are potential biomarkers of liver cancer. We also observed overexpression of these proteins and a tendency of EZR, CLIC5 and PODXL co-localization in human HCC biopsies.</p>
<p>It has been reported that the cytoplasmic expression of EZR correlates with the metastatic potential of various cell lines [<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131605.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our study using three HCC-derived cell lines is the first report to evaluate CLIC5 and PODXL expression in these cell lines, and our results suggest that CLIC5 is expressed in the cytoplasm and nuclei in all three cell types. No significant changes were detected in the level of PODXL protein expression among the cell lines. However, nuclear PODXL expression was found in HepG2 cells, whereas both nuclear and cytoplasmic PODXL expression was found in Huh7 and SNU387 cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that the EZR, CLIC5 and PODXL proteins are overexpressed during cell transformation and may undergo changes in subcellular localization during this process.</p>
<p>CLIC5 was initially described as a chloride ion channel, but it has little or no channel activity in vivo [<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, CLIC5 overexpression does induce 3T3-L1 cell proliferation and inhibit the expression of proteins associated with the differentiation of adipocytes [<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In our study, the downregulation of CLIC5 expression reduced Huh7 cell proliferation. In contrast, it has been shown that CLIC5 overexpression in C2C12 cells is associated with the inhibition of proliferation and promotion of differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p>
<p>The expression of EZR and PODXL proteins is associated with increased metastatic potential [<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131605.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131605.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We showed that downregulating CLIC5 decreased the migration and invasiveness of Huh7 cells, which may also be associated with both EZR and PODXL. Therefore, we propose that CLIC5 functions as a scaffold protein between these two proteins. Previous studies have shown that EZR inhibition in HCC cells decreases their migratory and invasive potential [<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131605.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In renal cancer, the interaction between EZR and PODXL occurs through EBP50, which serves as a scaffolding protein. Interestingly, the metastatic potential of renal carcinoma cells is significantly reduced when the PDZ1 and/or PDZ2 domains of EBP50 are absent [<xref rid="pone.0131605.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In liver cancer, CLIC5 might play a similar role because the inhibition of CLIC5 decreases the migration and invasion of Huh7 cells.</p>
<p>Although we observed co-localization of EZR, CLIC5 and PODXL in HCC samples, this expression pattern in tumor cells was only found in the late stage of HCC. Further experiments are needed to understand the biological importance of the interaction of these proteins in cancer. Finally, it is important to investigate whether these proteins are related to cell signals in other cancer processes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we propose that the co-expression of EZR, CLIC5 and PODXL in liver tissue occurs in pathological conditions, such as HCC, and that these proteins are associated with the increased cell migration and invasive potential of neoplastic cells. CLIC5 may function as a scaffold protein between EZR and PODXL, and the temporal association of this complex with pathological conditions needs to be further characterized.</p>
