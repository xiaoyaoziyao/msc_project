<abstract>
<p>In this study we established a bipedal animal model of steroid-associated hip joint collapse in emus for testing potential treatment protocols to be developed for prevention of steroid-associated joint collapse in preclinical settings. Five adult male emus were treated with a steroid-associated osteonecrosis (SAON) induction protocol using combination of pulsed lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and methylprednisolone (MPS). Additional three emus were used as normal control. Post-induction, emu gait was observed, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, and blood was collected for routine examination, including testing blood coagulation and lipid metabolism. Emus were sacrificed at week 24 post-induction, bilateral femora were collected for micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and histological analysis. Asymmetric limping gait and abnormal MRI signals were found in steroid-treated emus. SAON was found in all emus with a joint collapse incidence of 70%. The percentage of neutrophils (Neut %) and parameters on lipid metabolism significantly increased after induction. Micro-CT revealed structure deterioration of subchondral trabecular bone. Histomorphometry showed larger fat cell fraction and size, thinning of subchondral plate and cartilage layer, smaller osteoblast perimeter percentage and less blood vessels distributed at collapsed region in SAON group as compared with the normal controls. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed poor mineral matrix and more osteo-lacunae outline in the collapsed region in SAON group. The combination of pulsed LPS and MPS developed in the current study was safe and effective to induce SAON and deterioration of subchondral bone in bipedal emus with subsequent femoral head collapse, a typical clinical feature observed in patients under pulsed steroid treatment. In conclusion, bipedal emus could be used as an effective preclinical experimental model to evaluate potential treatment protocols to be developed for prevention of ON-induced hip joint collapse in patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Steroid-associated osteonecrosis (SAON) is a common orthopaedic problem although steroids are initially prescribed for many non-orthopedic medical conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), organ transplantation, asthma, rheumatologic arthritis (RA), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-AssoulineDayan1">[1]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Mont1">[5]</xref>. Part of SAON patients even evolved to hip joint collapse with subsequent total joint replacement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Nishii1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Bradway1">[7]</xref>, and its long-term durability however still remained a big challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Davis1">[8]</xref>. How to prevent accumulation of SAON lesions is the first-line strategy for avoiding joint collapse. Therefore, establishment of appropriated SAON animal models that mimic clinical etiology and even evolves to joint collapse is desirable prior to translating prevention and treatment experimental protocols into clinical validation and applications.</p>
<p>Up to now there is lack of ideal animal models to exam the treatment efficiency or therapeutic strategy for SAON-associated joint collapse. The limitation of the existing animal models, such as rabbit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Zhang1">[9]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Yamamoto1">[13]</xref>, rat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Bitto1">[14]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Okazaki1">[17]</xref>, mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Yang1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Cui1">[19]</xref>, pig <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Drescher2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Drescher3">[21]</xref> and chicken <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Cui2">[22]</xref> is that they fail to progress to the end-stage of SAON, i.e. structural collapse of the weight-bearing joints. With bipedality, high activity level and large enough bodyweight similar to that of human beings, ON model to be developed in emu femoral head could provide a unique opportunity to progress to human-like femoral head collapse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Conzemius1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Goetz1">[24]</xref>. Focal cryogenic (liquid nitrogen) insults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Conzemius1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Reed1">[25]</xref> and alternative cooling and heating insults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Fan1">[26]</xref> have also been tested to induce ON in emus with femoral head collapse. However, these models are not etiology- and or pathophysiology-orientated for SAON research. Accordingly, the aim of the current study was to establish a SAON model in bipedal emus, with potentials to bone structural deterioration with subsequent femoral head collapse, a condition seen in SAON patients attributed to similar biomechanics or loading ratio imposed onto the hip joint <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Conzemius1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Goetz1">[24]</xref>. Such a model would be essential for testing strategies to be developed for potential clinical applications for prevention and treatment of steroid-associated joint collapse.</p>
<p>Of all available animal models, rabbits were intensively used for establishing ON model where either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Irisa1">[27]</xref> or methylprednisolone (MPS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Asada1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Yamamoto2">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Yamamoto3">[29]</xref> or their combination (LPS+MPS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Qin1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Yamamoto1">[13]</xref> were tested. All of them showed effectiveness in ON induction, yet with varying degrees of ON lesions and mortality of animals. Based on our established SAON rabbit model with a high incidence of ON and low or no mortality that was induced by a combination of LPS and MPS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Qin1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Sheng1">[30]</xref>, we hypothesized that such a combination of pulsed LPS and MPS injections might also be able to induce SAON in bipedal emus with subsequent hip joint collapse.</p>

<title>Ethics Statement</title>
<p>The research ethics committee of Shenzhen Second Peoples' Hospital reviewed and approved the experimental protocols [Licence No. 2009‚Äì001] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0076797.s003">Appendix S1</xref>). Both the <italic>Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animal</italic> (1996) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Resources1">[31]</xref> and the ARRIVE (Animals in Research: Reporting <italic>In Vivo</italic> Experiments) guidelines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Kilkenny1">[32]</xref> were followed.</p>

<title>Animals, grouping and treatment</title>
<p>Eight 24 months old young adult male emus were used for this study. They were kept in Shenzhen Emu Institute and received food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Five emus assigned to the SAON group were treated with a combination of LPS and MPS. Three emus were used as controls without receiving either LPS or MPS. The emus were euthanized by intravenous injection of overdose of pentobarbital via jugular vein at 24 weeks post injection. The details of this combined protocol were described as follows: each emu was intravenously injected with lipopolysaccharide (Escherichia coli O111:B4; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) twice via jugular vein with 8 Œºg/kg body weight at an interval of 4 days from day 0. Thereafter, three injections of methylprednisolone (Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn, Peapack, NJ, USA) with 10 mg/kg body weight were given intramuscularly at gluteus muscle at an interval of 2 days. In addition, each emu was intramuscularly injected at gluteus muscle with 40 mg Omeprazole Sodium and orally with 250 mg Amoxicillin Dispersible per day for 7 days immediately after induction to prevent potential stomach ulcers and systemic infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0076797.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</title>
<p>MRI was performed with a 1.0 T MR unit (Magnetom Harmony; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) at baseline, week 2 and then at monthly basis on SAON induced emus for <italic>in vivo</italic> examination on bilateral proximal femora until 12 weeks post induction. For facilitating <italic>in vivo</italic> bioimaging examination, a specific posture fixture was designed to obtain a highly reproducible image during MRI scanning (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0076797.s002">Figure S2</xref>). A phased-array body coil was used for MRI scanning. Coronal turbo spin-echo fat-saturated T2-weighted images (4000 ms repetition time, 96 ms echo time) were obtained with a slice thickness of 3 mm and interslice gap of 0.3 mm from a field of view of 300 mm √ó 300 mm with a matrix of 320√ó320 pixels.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d">
<title>Hematological evaluation</title>
<p>Blood was sampled at baseline, week 2, 4 and 8 post induction for routine blood examination and serum was prepared for examination of both coagulation and lipid metabolism. The serum parameters related to lipid metabolism, including Total Cholesterol (TC), Total Glycerin (TG), Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) and High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL), and the serum parameters related to coagulation, including Prothrombin Time (PT), Prothrombin Time and International Normalized Ratio (PT/INR), Fibrinogen (FBG) and Thrombin Time (TT), were tested using standard clinical laboratory protocols for blood chemistry in Shenzhen Second Peoples' Hospital.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2e">
<title>Gait observation</title>
<p>Gait of emus with SAON was observed regularly after induction by recording abnormal gait pattern using a video camera. Normal gait of the control emus was also recorded for comparison (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0076797.s004">Video S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0076797.s005">S2</xref>). Emus walked or ran on a 20-meter walkway, and the sagittal plane motion was videotaped at 300 Hz by a high-speed video camera (Casio EX-F1, Japan). The videos were analyzed by a motion analysis system (Kwon3D XP, Korea) to obtain the included ankle joint angle during a gait stride cycle with respect to the time presented in term of percentage stride. Gait pattern was defined abnormal when there was a deviation of the included ankle joint kinematics (more than 20 degrees at any time) or the proportion of the stance and swing time (more than 10% deviation from control case).</p>

<title>Micro-CT scanning and analysis</title>
<p>Bilateral proximal femora from both control group and SAON group were sampled and fixed in 10% buffered neutral formalin solution for 10 days, and then soaked in 70% ethyl alcohol for measurement of trabecular morphology within and around ON lesions. In brief, the proximal femur was scanned using a high-resolution peripheral CT (HR-pQCT) (Xtreme CT, Scanco Medical, Br√ºttisellen, Switzerland) at a voltage of 70 kV and a current of 114 uA, with entire scan length of 40 mm in a spatial resolution of 40 Œºm used for animal experimental studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Xie1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Xie2">[34]</xref>. After the initial scanning, 2-dimentiaonal (2‚ÄìD) images were realigned in the Z-axis along the direction of femoral neck for further evaluation. For separating the signals of the mineralized tissue from the background signal, noise was removed using a low-pass Gaussian filter (Sigma‚Ää=‚Ää2.5, Support‚Ää=‚Ää2) and mineralized tissue was then defined at a threshold of 85. 3‚ÄìD structures of entire femoral heads were then reconstructed. The collapse was identified when fracture and/or clear deformation appeared in femoral head. A 10 mm √ó10 mm √ó8 mm region in the centre of femoral head was defined as the region of interest (ROI) for analysis and comparison. ROI was defined within subchondral region centered in the collapsed region or the corresponding region of the non-collapsed femoral heads, where the largest thickness of this ROI was 1/3 diameter of the femoral head. Bone mineral density (BMD), bone tissue volume fraction (BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb. N), trabecular thickness (Tb. Th) and trabecular separation (Tb. Sp) in the ROI were measured separately by the workstation with the built-in HR-pQCT software.</p>

<title>Histology</title>
<p>After micro-CT scanning, femoral heads were sawed in half longitudinally along the coronal plane. Halves were decalcified and embedded in paraffin; and halves were embedded in Methyl methacrylate (MMA) without decalcification.</p>
<sec id="s2g1">
<title>1. Decalcified sections</title>
<p>For paraffin embedded samples, sections were sliced along the coronal plane for hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) and fast green and safranin O staining, respectively. A microscope imaging system (Leica Q500MC; Leica Micro-systems, Wetzlar, Germany) was used to digitalize the histological sections for histomorphometric evaluation. 1) Examination of ON: The entire area of each H&amp;E stained section was examined for the presence of ON with the established criteria, i.e. diffuse presence of empty lacunae or pyknotic nuclei of osteocytes in the trabeculae, accompanied by surrounding necrotic bone marrow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Yamamoto1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Yamamoto2">[28]</xref>.

The total bone marrow in subchondral bone was 200 fold magnified and captured. The fat cells were manually traced and then quantified. The fat cell size was interpreted by Fetet's diameter, i.e. the longest distance between any two points along a region of interest (ROI) boundary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Qin1">[11]</xref>. The fat cell area fraction was defined as total marrow fat cell area normalized by total marrow tissue area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Zhang2">[35]</xref>. 3) Histomorphometry of the subchondral plate: the thickness of subchondral bone plate of the femoral head was measured on the 50√ó images. At least 10 views per section were randomly selected for measuring. The thickness was examined by measuring point-to-point distance from the top of the calcified cartilage to the deep surface of the subchondral bone plate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Wang1">[36]</xref>. 4) Examination of articular cartilage: The average thickness of cartilage were examined by the total area of cartilage divided by the length of cartilage band measured from the manually traced region on the entire frontal sections for evaluation under 200√ó magnification. The thickness of cartilage at the collapsed region or the corresponding region of the non-collapsed femoral head was also examined. The proteoglycans content was quantified by measuring the thickness of safranin O stained articular cartilage. 5) Calculation of osteoblasts: The osteoblast perimeter percentage (%Ob.Pm) was calculated as the ratio of the total perimeter of the trabecular surface covered by osteoblasts to the whole perimeter of the trabecular surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Parfitt1">[37]</xref>. 6) Blood vessel quantification: The number of blood vessels within the collapsed region or the corresponding region of the non-collapsed femoral head was quantified on H&amp;E sections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Lane1">[38]</xref>.</p>

The incidence of SAON was defined as the number of SAON emus divided by total number of emus in each group, and analyzed with fisher's exact test. The serum parameters were expressed as Mean ¬± SD, and analyzed by one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a post hoc Bonferroni's multiple comparison test to compare the differences between every time point and baseline. Micro-CT and histomorphometry data were expressed as Mean ¬± SD, and analyzed with Mann Whitney test to compare the differences between the control group and SAON group. SPSS 10.0 was used. The significance for comparison was set at <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using a combined pulsed LPS and MPS induction protocol previously established for SAON quadrupedal rabbits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Qin1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Yamamoto1">[13]</xref>, the present study established a SAON model in bipedal emus characterized with subchondral bone deterioration and hip joint collapse, an experimental model mimicking human ON often developed at hip joint with femoral head collapse.</p>
<p>As bioimaging evidence, we used MRI to evaluate <italic>in vivo</italic> alteration of MRI signals in the first 12 weeks post induction as MRI could diagnose early-stage ON, even presymptomatically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Fordyce1">[42]</xref>. Abnormal signals were firstly detected at week 2 post-induction, showing large scales of edema at the proximal femora. This phenomena is similar to clinical ON where the bone marrow edema was found from MRI earlier than either formation of the necrotic lesion or the collapse of the necrotic fragment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Turner1">[43]</xref>. However, MRI of emu hips merely shows bone marrow edema without typical band pattern shown in initial MRI signaling of ON patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Kubo1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Fujioka1">[45]</xref>. This could be explained by the differences in anatomy and physiology of human (mammals) and emu (aves), such as that the bone marrow of emu hip mainly presented in subchondral bone in a shell-shaped region and there was hollow structure in emu's bone marrow cavity at both femoral neck and head. Irrespective such differences, there were common structural features, i.e. ON lesion and hip joint collapse found in SAON emus and this would provide a platform, i.e. a large bipedal animal model for testing biomaterials developed for bone defect repair, including for that after surgical core-decompression in hip joints, a condition indicated for patients with early stage of ON.</p>
<p>For functional evidence, asymmetric limping gait was observed at week 12 post-induction, suggesting that emus might suffer from joint pain caused by the ON lesion formation and structural damage confirm histologically after harvesting the samples for detailed analysis. This symptom was also common in patients at early stage of ON <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Koo1">[46]</xref>. The asymmetric limping gait shown in bipedal emus was similar to the low limb dysfunction in SAON patients with subchondral lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Lv1">[47]</xref>.</p>
<p>For biochemical evidence, the current study suggested hyperlipidemia occurred after SAON induction, which was evidenced by a significant increase in TC at all examined time point post-induction. In addition, abnormal higher lipid transportation to the peripheral tissues also occurred after induction, as evidenced by a significant increase in LDL/HDL, which was consistent with the results found in both SAON rabbit model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Zhang1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Qin1">[11]</xref> and ON patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Moskal1">[48]</xref>. However, there was no significant difference in coagulation-related parameters after induction as compared with baseline, while hypercoagulable and hypofibrinolysis state were reported in SAON rabbit model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Zhang1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Qin1">[11]</xref> and SARS ON patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Sun2">[49]</xref>. This inconsistency suggested that the pathogenesis of SAON in emu might be explained by the dominant disorder in lipid metabolism.</p>
<p>Histological and histomorphometric analysis was performed in three ROIs of the femoral head, including the articular cartilage, subchondral bone region and the central part of the femoral head. Under higher magnification of the subchondral bone region where edema was shown in MRI images, remarkable necrotic changes were observed in emu after induction, including 1) avascular zone at load bearing region, referring to the blood vessels quantification within the collapsed region; 2) extravascular adipogenesis (fat cell enlargement); 3) apoptosis of osteocytes in regions next to the marrow region packed with fat cells; and 4) thinning of subchondral bone, poor quality of bone matrix and more osteo-lacunae that weakens the mechanical integrity of the femoral head, which could also be weakened by the necrosis and thinning of articular cartilage. These were essential indices of later joint collapse, typically seen in SAON patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Griffith1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Shen1">[51]</xref> that were substantiated in our histomorphometric analysis. On the contrary, our micro-CT evaluation for the central region of the femoral head, where no bone structural collapse was demonstrated, implied that the pulsed LPS-MPS induction protocol did not result in general osteoporosis as no difference in boney structural and BMD was found between SAON emus and normal controls in regions away from the subchondral bone. This finding was also similar to a bone densitometry study in SARS patients who underwent pulsed steroid treatment in Hong Kong <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Lau1">[52]</xref>. No obvious osteoporosis found in SAON patients with joint collapse or animals were mainly explained by short-term effects of pulsed corticosteroid administration that resulted in local damage of vasculature in the subchondral bone region and impairment of bone marrow mononuclear cells, which triggered up-regulation of osteoclastic activities and inadequate bone formation known as destructive repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-AssoulineDayan1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Nishii1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Sun1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Xie2">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Ito1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Hernigou1">[54]</xref>. Yet, long-term steroid administration was known to be able to induce secondary osteoporosis in patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Solomon1">[55]</xref> or animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Bitto1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>In spite of the presence of difference in hip anatomy, the similarity in biomechanics of the hip joint with regard to proportion of joint loading between human and bipedal emu was well characterized by Iowa Biomechanics Research Group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Goetz2">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Troy1">[57]</xref>. The contact stress of femoral head was reported with a maximum hip contact force of approximately 5.5 times of body weight in emus, directed axially along its femoral neck, which was moderately larger than that of humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Goetz2">[56]</xref> and the contact stress magnitude and the sites of habitual loading on the femoral head was also comparable between emu hip and the human hip <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Troy1">[57]</xref>. That the joint biomechanics plays a crucial role for NO-induced hip joint collapse was also well supported by findings obtained from bipedal and quadrupedal animals. In fact, the ON-induction protocol with a combination of LPS and MPS successfully induced SAON in quadruped animals, yet without resulting in subchondral collapse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Qin1">[11]</xref>, although inadequate repair was also demonstrated in quadruped SAON animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Zhang2">[35]</xref>. Besides emu study, another report showed that the chicken was also bipedal animal suitable for building up SAON animal model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Cui2">[22]</xref>, yet their induction protocol did not result in hip joint collapse. In order to mimic ON and hip joint collapse, we tested large bipedal emus not because of its similarity in hip joint biomechanics to that of human but mainly that emu hip was sizeable to perform core decompression and testing porous scaffold biomaterials developed for potential clinical applications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Chen1">[58]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Chen2">[60]</xref>.</p>
<p>The SAON induction protocol tested in the present study successfully induced hip joint collapse in large bipedal emus. The occurrence of hip joint collapse in emus was apparent more (7 out of 10 hips from 5 emus) than clinical data, such as 32.7% SAON incidence reported by Li ZR and co-workers in their well-documented clinical study in SARS patients who were treated with a high dose of corticosteroid for life-saving <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Li1">[61]</xref>. As SAON incidence is often dose-dependent and the purpose of the current preclinical study is to establish a SAON bipedal large animal model with high incidence of ON and hip joint collapse, we tested much higher dose of MPS as compared with clinical recommended dose for SARS patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Li1">[61]</xref>. Differ to human situation where only MPS was used, we used both LPS and MPS pulsed treatment, where LPS served the purpose to mimic clinical conditions, i.e. disease-related tissue inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Qin1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Irisa1">[27]</xref>, in addition to higher mechanical loading imposed to the hip joint in emus where emu hip joint share 65‚Äì70% of the body weight as compared with around 60% of body weight in human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Goetz2">[56]</xref>.</p>
<p>In present emu study, we selected two LPS injections with 4 days interval that showed safe and effective to induce SAON. Neut % increased 2 weeks post induction and decreased gradually to baseline level from 2 weeks to 8 weeks post induction which indicated inflammation reaction induced by LPS. No typical clinical Shwartzman reaction was observed in emus as we did not systemically study the non-skeletal tissue thrombosis or reticuloendothelial blockage for comparison with that in SAON patients. It would be of interest to study in details the differences in physical or immune responses between human and birds in SAON in future. In our previous study, we established SAON in rabbit with 1√óLPS (10 ¬µg/kg) +3√óMPS (20mg/kg) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Qin1">[11]</xref>. As emu was estimated with similar body surface area to that of human, we calculated the current experimental dose based on the conventional human-rabbit dose conversion. However, the dose for the initial experiment for emu was 6.67 mg/kg. As we found that emus could tolerate larger dosage from our pilot study, we increased MPS dose to 10 mg/kg for the current study at a time interval of 2 days for avoiding potential side-effect of MPS injection. Specific design for studying dosing effects (amount and frequency of LPS and MPS treatment) would also be of interests for further studies.</p>
<p>The limitation of the current experimental study is that we are not able to delineate if the cause of joint collapse is attributed to SAON and/or cartilage and subchondral bone thinning as we did not observe typical destructive repair by uncoupling of osteoclasts and osteoblasts as well as extensive local fibrosis found within necrotic regions reported in both quadrupedal rabbit model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Zhang2">[35]</xref> or patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Plenk1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Hansen1">[63]</xref>. Future studies shall be designed to monitor such pathological changes at various time points after ON-induction. Larger sample size would also be appreciated although our findings did reach statistical significance where we estimated sample size using PS (Power and Sample Size Calculations Version 3.0) for establishing our current emu SAON model based on our previous rabbit model with a SAON incidence of 93% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076797-Qin1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this was the first experimental study to confirm that a combined injection protocol of pulsed LPS and MPS was able to induce ON and deterioration of subchondral bone microarchitecture in bipedal emus, with subsequent femoral head collapse. The establishment of this bipedal emu model with hip joint collapse provided a platform for evaluation of potential treatment protocols to be developed for prevention of steroid-associated hip joint collapse.</p>
