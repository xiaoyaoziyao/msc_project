<abstract>
<p>Insect pollination is of great importance to crop production worldwide and honey bees are amongst its chief facilitators. Because of the decline of managed colonies, the use of sensor technology is growing in popularity and it is of interest to develop new methods which can more accurately and less invasively assess honey bee colony status. Our approach is to use accelerometers to measure vibrations in order to provide information on colony activity and development. The accelerometers provide amplitude and frequency information which is recorded every three minutes and analysed for night time only. Vibrational data were validated by comparison to visual inspection data, particularly the brood development. We show a strong correlation between vibrational amplitude data and the brood cycle in the vicinity of the sensor. We have further explored the minimum data that is required, when frequency information is also included, to accurately predict the current point in the brood cycle. Such a technique should enable beekeepers to reduce the frequency with which visual inspections are required, reducing the stress this places on the colony and saving the beekeeper time.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Insect pollination has been demonstrated to be of tremendous importance to crop production and the survival of wild plants [<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and honeybees (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic>) play a major role in ensuring these [<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Because of the decline of managed colonies recently observed in Europe [<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and in the USA [<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and with regard to these important pollinator services provided by bees [<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the health of honeybee populations has been a growing concern amongst scientists, ecologists, farmers and policy makers [<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Monitoring for pests, parasites and diseases, as well as colony strength, is a vital element of successful beekeeping. Brood rearing and colony growth depend (among other things) on the queen's reproductive state (i.e. the number of eggs a queen can potentially lay per day) and because larvae are reared by adults, the size of the worker population [<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The amount of brood that is reared determines the colony's population size and hence future brood rearing. It is also basic information for the beekeeper to estimate bee colony health.</p>
<p>There are important diseases that can affect both sealed and unsealed brood. They are caused by bacteria, fungi, parasites, pesticides or viruses [<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. European Foulbrood (EFB) and American Foulbrood (AFB) are major bacterial diseases, economically important in honeybees worldwide, and highly infectious. AFB is the most damaging bacterial brood disease. Not only does it kill infected larvae but it is also potentially lethal to infected colonies [<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. EFB is also a severe disease, affecting mainly unsealed brood, killing honeybee larvae usually when they are 4–5 days old [<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Another disease that can severely affect the brood is Chalkbrood, caused by the fungus <italic>Ascosphaera apis</italic>. It can be recognised by the presence of mummified larvae at the entrance or back end of the hive and the presence of a spotty brood pattern. Even if <italic>A</italic>. <italic>apis</italic> is lethal to individual larvae, it usually does not destroy an entire bee colony. However, it can cause significant losses in terms of both bee numbers and colony productivity [<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. <italic>Varroa destructor</italic> also impacts the brood of colonies as it enters the brood cells just before capping, and further reproduces inside capped cells [<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In severe infestations, the brood symptoms of <italic>Parasitic Mite Syndrome</italic> often resemble those of EFB and sacbrood [<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Specific pesticides can also affect honeybee immature phases, larvae, nymphs and pupae [<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] or predispose brood to diseases [<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Larvae may be exposed to the chemicals both by contact and/or orally. Well known active substances affecting larvae are insect growth regulators such as fenoxycarb, which is used as a toxic standard in toxicological tests on larvae (OECD 2013). However, other molecules (e.g. fungicides like Captan<sup>TM</sup>, Iprodione, Chlorothalonil or Ziram® and acaricides/insecticides like Fluvalinate, Coumaphos or Chloropyrifos) with different modes of action can also affect brood [<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
<p>To assess honeybee colony health, beekeepers must open the hive and visually inspect for the presence of diseases and colony development and strength (bee and brood quantity). However, this intrusive inspection is a source of stress to the colony and is also time consuming. Worker bees can be killed during this invasive assessment, and there is also a risk that the queen will be killed in the process [<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
<p>The use of modern sensor technology to monitor honeybee colony status is growing in popularity [<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. There are already devices, such as electronic scales for measuring temporal hive weight changes, but the increase in hive weight can be due to increased pollen and nectar collection by foragers even in times of colony stress, including the presence of diseases [<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It is therefore of interest to develop new non-invasive methods that can further contribute to assessing colony physiological status. Our approach is to use accelerometers inserted in the central frame of the hives to measure vibrational amplitudes in order to provide information on bee population, activity, and development. To validate vibrational data, visual inspection data of the colonies, particularly the brood development, are reported for correlation. We show that suitable vibrational data processing allows highly sensitive monitoring of the brood cycle in the vicinity of the sensor. We also explore the minimum data that are required, when frequency information is included, to accurately determine the current point in the brood cycle.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Honey comb vibrational measurements were undertaken with accelerometers embedded in the centre of hive's frames, in an apiary consisting of 22 hives.</p>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Apiaries</title>
<p>One ‘Langstroth’ and 19 'Dadant' hives were set up in a line over approximately 40 meters length in Avignon, France, in March 2014, with permission from INRA (owner of the site). They were managed using standard beekeeping practices and continuously monitored for vibrations until November 2014 apart from short power cuts. Only data from this apiary were used for the numerical discrimination exercise.</p>
<p>Two hives ('British Standard National') were set up in Nottingham, UK, in March 2013, with permission from NTU (owner of the site), and were continuously monitored for vibrations for 13 months apart from short power cuts.</p>
<p>The population status of the colonies in Avignon was evaluated seven times, from March to October, using the ColEval [<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] method. This method allows estimation of the percentage of each frame having brood, honey and pollen, as well as the number of worker bees in the colony [<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Hives were opened once a month and each side of each frame was examined.</p>

<title>Vibrational measurements</title>
<p>Accelerometers (100mV/g in France and 1000mV/g in UK, Brüel and Kjær (Nærum, Denmark) ref: 4705) were pressed into the honey comb of the centre of the central frame of all monitored hives, to monitor vibrations transverse to the plane of the comb. Small amounts of molten wax were poured on the sensors to avoid direct exposure of metallic parts. Spectra with a bandwidth of 5500Hz and a resolution of 3.125 Hz were averaged for 3 minutes and stored on a hard disc with Brüel and Kjær's PULSE software, on a computer set to reboot itself every day at midnight. Data were stored on files covering one day of data (tailored PULSE macros supplied by Brüel and Kjær). Although occasional breaks in data logging occurred during power cuts, recordings resumed automatically upon reestablishment of power. Four of the twenty colonies in France were additionally monitored with accelerometers secured, externally, to the middle front face of the brood box (<xref rid="pone.0141926.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> to <xref rid="pone.0141926.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref> Figs). One of the colonies in the UK was measured with eight accelerometers embedded in the centre of eight contiguous frames.</p>
<p>Longer spectral averaging was explored by using successive averaged spectra. Histograms were obtained with a bin width sometimes tailored to the vibrational average strength of the colony under consideration, and ranging from 0.1x10<sup>-7</sup> m/s<sup>-2</sup> to 0.4x10<sup>-7</sup> m/s<sup>-2</sup>.</p>
<p>Analysis was undertaken using code written in the Matlab® core (at Nottingham Trent University, NTU), with the additional use of the 'statistics toolbox' for Generalised Linear Modelling, using the glmfit function. We used the DFA algorithm implemented in Matlab® with a routine made available to us by Professor Roy Goodacre (Manchester University, UK).

<title>Overnight vibrational amplitude distributions</title>
<p>To minimise the effect of daytime foraging activity of the bees and occasional high amplitude spikes in the data set, for example caused by human intervention in the hive, only vibrational frequency spectra measured between midnight and six a.m. were considered. A histogram of the amplitudes was produced as described in <xref rid="pone.0141926.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> and this then lost any frequency information contained within the data.</p>

Note the pronounced peaks at 125 Hz and 250 Hz, a feature common to all honeybee vibrational spectra collected from the comb. (B) A histogram of amplitude values from the same data shown in panel A. The majority of amplitudes are found between 1x10<sup>-6</sup> m/s<sup>-2</sup> and 5x10<sup>-6</sup> m/s<sup>-2</sup>, as clearly seen in (A). Note that the information regarding frequency is lost. (C) Vibrational spectra (averaged over 3 minutes) collected from midnight to 7 a.m shown as a spectrogram. Each vertical line is the equivalent of the spectrum in (A) but with the amplitude now colour coded (blue = 0 ms<sup>-2</sup>, red = 3x10<sup>-5</sup> ms<sup>-2</sup>). The large number of spectra available each night results in the histogram shown in (D) which is much smoother. In subsequent figures all histograms shown have been further normalised to their maximum value, this would be approximately 340 in the case of panel D.</p>

<p>More than one hundred spectra were available each night resulting in a good estimate of the amplitude most often logged during the night. Each histogram was normalised to its maximum value and then colour coded with black equal to zero and red equal to one (the most often occurring amplitude). When a suitable range of vibrational frequencies is considered (see <xref rid="pone.0141926.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0141926.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> movies), the histograms exhibit a single, pronounced maximum, which oscillates with a remarkably regular period, closely matched to, although slightly greater than, that of the worker bee brood cycle (<xref rid="pone.0141926.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Overnight vibrational amplitude distributions for three colonies.</title>
<p>In colony No. 5, the most common vibrational amplitude oscillates regularly over the entire summer, whilst in colony No. 6, a period without a peak in May takes place three weeks after the primary swarm (the date of which is indicated with the yellow tick in early April). Visual inspection revealed that colony No. 2 was temporarily 'drone laying' in July, and this is also reflected as a clear perturbation of the cycle. Histograms are all normalised to their maximum (red pixel). The data for all colonies is available in <xref rid="pone.0141926.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>.</p>

<p>The regular oscillation is disturbed after a primary swarm or when a colony has lost its queen. It is also disturbed prior to summer colony failure (<xref rid="pone.0141926.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). It is absent in the winter time and the phase of the oscillation is frame-dependent (<xref rid="pone.0141926.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>).</p>

<p>The periodically repeating maximum can be extracted, for example by fitting an analytical function to the distributions and the period of the oscillation quantitated by Fourier transformation of the time series of these coordinates.

<p>All 20 colonies from one apiary are shown, including those used in <xref rid="pone.0141926.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>. The spectra have been normalised to their maximum and subsequently sorted to show the colonies with the shortest period (top) to the longest (bottom). Note many spectral maxima in remarkable agreement, between 21 and 26 days. Colony 2, which was found 'drone laying' for a month or so, exhibits small peaks that are additional to the single one seen for Colony 5 and 6. Only one colony (No. 4) out of 20 does not exhibit a clear peak in the range 21 to 26 days. Only four colonies out of 20 do not have their maximum in that same range. Two of these (No. 12, and No. 14) are colonies that failed a month after their primary swarm took place.</p>

<title>Correlation between vibrational measurements and visually assessed frame condition</title>
<p>The brood, pollen and honey levels visually assessed on most frames exhibit remarkable agreement on either side of the frames. As there is only one sensor in a given frame and it is in the middle, we assume that it is affected equally by each side and the ColEval data were therefore averaged for the frames in which the accelerometer resided. In <xref rid="pone.0141926.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> each quantity is plotted against the maximum in the vibrational amplitude at the seven points in time where visual assessments took place for the three colonies shown in <xref rid="pone.0141926.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>.</p>

Brood and honey levels both contribute to reduce the measured signal and the effect of linearly combining them, together with pollen to further improve the correlation, are also shown in <xref rid="pone.0141926.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>; a set of plots for all the hives show a similar correlation and are included in <xref rid="pone.0141926.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref> including a linear combination using three generic coefficients, different from those in <xref rid="pone.0141926.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>. The contribution to signal damping from the honey levels is the highest even though, on these central frames, honey is seldom greater than 20% of the frame area and is often located at the periphery.</p>

<title>Single averaged spectrum analysis</title>
<p>The ability to determine the position in the brood cycle from a single averaged spectrum has been investigated by means of a simple two step clustering exercise; note that we are now including frequency information as well as the amplitude. Five colonies were selected (colonies 2, 5, 6, 7 and 15), on the basis of the clarity and regularity of the oscillations that their distributions exhibit, as candidates to identify an algorithm that would further allow predictive discrimination on the other colonies. Although strict validation of the outcome is not possible (honeycomb loads in the vicinity of the accelerometer are not known), it is useful to explore whether frequency-resolved accelerometer data carries the oscillating information seen in the amplitude data. Spectra were selected at some of the maxima and minima of their respective oscillations, and underwent Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. For each spectrum, the corresponding dominant 10 PCA scores were further fed into a Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) [<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] for supervised discrimination based on troughs and peaks. In order to find discriminant functions with generic effectiveness to all five colonies in the data set, the best results were obtained when the PCA scores were collapsed onto three DFA scores, and when measurements from all five colonies in the 'low vibrational amplitude' state were clustered into a single cloud, whilst measurements in the 'high vibrational amplitude' states were clustered into separate clouds for different colonies. When raw spectra, containing both amplitude and frequency information were fed into the algorithm, suitable clustering could be achieved provided the measurement comprised at least 30 minutes of averaging, as shown in <xref rid="pone.0141926.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>.</p>

<p>Clustering is also possible purely on the basis of vibrational spectral shape. However when spectra normalised to their maximum were fed into the algorithm, discrimination necessitates measurements with at least 60 minutes spectral averaging, as can be seen in <xref rid="pone.0141926.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="sec010">
<title>Evidence suggesting brood cycle sensing</title>
<p>Numerous features of the vibrational amplitude oscillations that we have highlighted directly point to those of the honeybee brood cycle:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>its period is remarkably constant from colony to colony and slightly longer than 21 days, consistent with honeybees known to take some time to maintain a cell immediately after the birth of a worker bee, before the queen would lay a fresh egg in the same cell. This, together with the fact that the queen may be busy on another frame, accounts of the measured period of our oscillation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>its absence in the winter time is consistent with the fact that the queen does not lay in that season.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>its absence after a primary swarm and in a drone-laying colony is consistent with the fact that these situations respectively correspond to a temporary absence of brood, or absence of locally synchronous brood, in frames.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>its frame-varying phase is consistent with a honeybee queen concentrating on one side of a frame at a time to lay eggs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>its maxima taking place at low levels of recorded brood is consistent with the fact that an increase in honey comb density enhances the attenuation of the measured vibrations with a constant stimulus, as a consequence of Newton's second law (denser objects are harder to accelerate with the same force).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>its ability to correlate with a spectral shape change is consistent with the frame load affecting the vibrational modes of the honey comb. As an empty honey comb is gradually loaded with pollen, brood and honey, vibrational spectral changes are expected in addition to the simple signal attenuation mentioned above. In the simple driven harmonic oscillator the acceleration is proportional to the square of the frequency.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>its origin lying in the vibrational modes change of the honey comb is further substantiated by the observation that vibrational signals measured in the wall of the hive do not exhibit the oscillation revealed in the honey comb (see <xref rid="pone.0141926.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> to <xref rid="pone.0141926.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref> Figs). With time, the walls of the hive will not suffer 'load' or density changes, except perhaps for small moisture increase/decrease with rain/lack of rain, so any signal changes seen there are essentially coming from the variations in the stimulus causing the recorded vibrations: the honeybee sounds and vibrations. The stimulus is clearly not exhibiting the regular, deep oscillation in amplitude recorded on the honeycomb accelerometers.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The honeycomb may be seen as a vibrating substrate, stimulated by sounds and vibrations originating from honeybees in the colony. As the comb content changes, its corresponding transfer function changes too, and in spite of variations in the stimulating signal (evidenced e.g. by the data coming from the wall of the hive) it is the vibrational transmission changes that dominate the modulation of the measured substrate acceleration. The maxima of the amplitude oscillation (appearing as valleys on Figs <xref rid="pone.0141926.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0141926.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, and peaks on Figs <xref rid="pone.0141926.g008" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0141926.g009" ref-type="fig">9</xref>) most probably correspond to the intervals between brood-rearing (when cells in the vicinity of the sensor are empty). This correspondence is consistent with (i) with the observed unusually long high amplitude sections taking place after a primary swarm or a drone laying colony, (ii) the ColEval data, (iii) the period closely matching that of the brood cycle, and finally (iv) Newton's second law. The relatively disappointing correlation with the recorded brood levels may be attributed to errors arising from (i) recordings relying on visual estimates, (ii) recordings referring to an entire frame, whilst our accelerometers are more sensitive to solid structures closer to them, (iii) some measurements being affected by deviations in the source of the measured vibrations, i.e. activities of the bees themselves. The outcome of the vibrational amplitude spectral shape analysis is encouraging, in suggesting that the brood cycle could be monitored using only one hour of night time measurements, in a way less sensitive to drifts than when using amplitude alone, more generic to multiple colonies, and more specific to the brood cycle. The exploitation of the results by other researchers requires no sophisticated numerical analysis. The discriminant curves shown in the last plots of Figs <xref rid="pone.0141926.g006" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0141926.g007" ref-type="fig">7</xref> simply need cross-correlating with the measured averaged spectrum to give a set of 3D coordinates used to compute the distance to the centroid of interest. Therefore, all that is needed by others is the discriminant curves and the coordinates of the centroid(s) of interest.</p>
<p>Improved brood cycle monitoring could be obtained by applying an artificial stimulus to the frame with known amplitude and frequency rather than relying on the bees to generate the vibrations, and potentially allowing further specific sensitivity to brood, honey and pollen to be identified. Inexpensive accelerometer sensors that cover the relevant range of frequencies are readily available. An improved validation of the signal's sensitivity could be obtained by regular photographic assessment of the vicinity of the accelerometers. This would allow us to check e.g. the hypothesis that queens that lay brood with minimal interleaved empty cells will produce a frame with a vibrational oscillation with a deeper peak-to-trough ratio than those where interleaved empty cells are common.</p>
<p>Mathematical models of the normal brood cycle can easily be performed as a function of the time of the year using vibrational measurements from accelerometer and can be used as a tool to detect abnormal brood cycle to be transmitted to the beekeeper. This information can be helpful to the beekeeper as they can visit the colony to diagnose and solve the problem. Abnormal brood cycle may result from diseases, swarming, queen failure, pesticide exposure or lack of room in the hive. In case of a disease, it can be controlled using medicine or beekeeping techniques or destroying the colony; this would be required in the case of American Foulbrood to avoid the disease spreading to other colonies. This tool also opens new promising opportunities for the testing of toxicological effects at the colony level, enabling long-term, non-invasive observations and bridging the gap between laboratory and field tests. If the abnormal brood cycle is due to swarming, then the beekeeper will have to check for a new queen and follow the development of the colony. Detecting a queen failure will be useful so that the beekeeper can replace it or introduce the workers of the colony to another one with a queen so as to save the queenless workers.</p>
<p>Monitoring of the brood cycle is an interesting scientific tool to measure population dynamics of honeybee colonies. As brood development is closely linked to the climate, it can be performed in different regions of the world or of a country to look at differences in brood development. There are 28 different geographical bee subspecies [<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], some of which have a very different brood cycle. Some ecotypes have even been identified to have a brood cycle linked to the blooming of local flowers [<xref rid="pone.0141926.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Measuring the evolution of the brood cycle of those honeybees is of important evolutionary and ecological interest.</p>

<p>For the same colony (colony 6), overnight histograms of amplitude distribution are shown (top figure), when the upper limit of the cropped spectra (bottom figure) is increased from 255 to 800 Hz, whilst the lower limit is kept at 10 Hz. The effects are large and varied. To start with, most amplitude distributions exhibit two peaks, although some have one or three peaks. As the upper limit becomes larger than 400 Hz, a steady states emerges, gradually leading to extremely well defined unique maxima for each night under investigation. The oscillation of interest in our study is seen with the highest contrast for an upper limit around 600 Hz.</p>
