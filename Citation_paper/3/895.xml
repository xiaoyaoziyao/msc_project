<title>Objective</title>
<p>This study was performed to investigate the therapeutic effects of iguratimod in a lupus mouse model.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Female MRL/lpr mice were treated with iguratimod, vehicle solution or cyclophosphamide. Proteinuria was monitored and kidney injury was blindly scored by a renal pathologist. Serum anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies were monitored by radioimmunoassay. Kidney IgG and CD20 were stained by immunohistochemistry. Splenic lymphocyte phenotypes were analyzed by flow cytometry. BAFF, IL-17A, IL-6, and IL-21 levels in serum and splenic lymphocytes were detected by ELISA or quantitative PCR.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Compared with the vehicle-treated controls, MRL/lpr mice treated with iguratimod showed less protenuria, less acute pathological lesions and no chronic changes in the kidneys. There were significant differences in glomerular injury and vasculitis scores, as well as in the semi-quantitave analysis of immune complex deposition between the two groups. Disease activity markers in sera (anti-dsDNA antibodies and immunoglobulin levels) were reduced and hypocomplementemia was attenuated. Lymphocyte expression of BAFF, IL-6, IL-17A and IL-21 was decreased. The abnormal splenic B220+ T cell and plasma cell populations in MRL/lpr mice were reduced by iguratimod treatment, with recovery of the total B cell population and inhibition of B cell infiltration of the kidney tissue. The dosage of iguratimod used in this study showed no significant cytotoxic effects <italic>in vivo</italic> and no overt side-effects were observed.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Iguratimod ameliorates immune nephritis in MRL/lpr mice via a non-antiproliferative mechanism. Our data suggest a potential therapeutic role of iguratimod in lupus.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Iguratimod (iguratimod, N-[7-[(methanesulfonyl) amino]-4-oxo-6-phenoxy-4H-1-benzopyran-3-yl] formamide) is a small molecular weight immunomodulator. We, and other researchers, have demonstrated the therapeutic effect of iguratimod both in the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Du1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Du2">[2]</xref> and in clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-L1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Hara1">[5]</xref> This agent has been approved for treating RA in several countries over the last 3 years.</p>
<p>During the last two decades, a series of studies have demonstrated multiple immunomodulatory effects of the iguratimod. This agent inhibits nuclear factor-κB activity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Kohno1">[6]</xref> blocks IL-17 signaling, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Luo1">[7]</xref> stabilizes the lysosome membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Sawada1">[8]</xref> and suppresses inflammatory cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Du1">[1]</xref> both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Notably, iguratimod reduces immunoglobulin production by acting directly on B cells in both mice and humans, despite having no notable effect on B cell proliferation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Tanaka1">[9]</xref> We also observed decreased serum anti-type II collagen antibody titers in the CIA model following iguratimod treatment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Du1">[1]</xref> In clinical trials, serum levels of rheumatoid factor and immunoglobulin were also decreased in RA patients after iguratimod treatment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Lu1">[4]</xref></p>
<p>Based on these observations, we hypothesized that iguratimod is a plausible candidate for the treatment of another autoimmune disease, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), since all of the mechanisms described participate in the development of this disease. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Sanz1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Martin1">[13]</xref></p>
<p>We tested our hypothesis in the MRL/lpr mouse model of lupus. This strain spontaneously develops an autoimmune syndrome characterized by immune nephritis and autoantibody production, which closely resembles human (SLE). In these mice, Fas-dependent apoptosis is deficient because of a mutation in the <italic>lpr</italic> gene, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Watson1">[14]</xref> leading to a rapid acceleration and deterioration of the autoimmune condition driven by genes of the MRL mouse lineage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Cohen1">[15]</xref></p>
<p>Therefore, we treated MRL/lpr mice with iguratimod, vehicle solution or cyclophosphamide. We assessed the effects of iguratimod on immune nephritis, proteinuria, kidney histology and serum markers, as well as its cellular and molecular effects on lymphocytes in MRL/lpr mice.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Treatment of mice</title>
<p>Iguratimod was kindly provided by Simcere Pharmaceutical Group (Nanjing, China). Female MRL/lpr mice were purchased from the Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center and were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions. All of the experimental protocols involving animals and their care were approved by the Committee on Use of Human &amp; Animal Subjects in Teaching and Research of the Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, and were carried out in accordance with the regulations of the Department of Health of Shanghai. All surgery was performed under chloral hydrate anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. All mice were sacrificed using cervical dislocation.</p>
<p>To assess the effects on the treatment of nephritis treatment, 8-week old mice were selected at random for oral administration of iguratimod (30 mg/kg d, n = 14) or vehicle solution (1% carboxyl methyl cellulose, CMC solution, n = 15) for 20 weeks before being sacrificed. For analysis of serum immunology and lymphocyte subsets, female MRL/lpr mice (aged 10 weeks) were treated orally with iguratimod (30 mg/kg d, n = 5), vehicle solution (1% CMC solution, n = 5) or with cyclophosphamide (20 mg/kg w, n = 5) intraperitoneally as a positive control. Animals were sacrificed after 8 weeks of treatment.</p>

<title>Serum and urine analysis</title>
<p>Blood samples were collected every 4 weeks from 7 weeks of age. Serum C3 was detected by ELISA (ICL lab, Portland, OR, USA), anti-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody titers were quantified by radioimmunoassay and serum alanine transaminase (ALT), creatinine and blood cell counts were analyzed by using an autoanalyzer.</p>
<p>To determine kidney injury in MRL/lpr mice, urine samples were collected every 3 weeks from the 7 weeks of age by placing the mice individually in metabolic cages for 24 h. Urine protein concentrations were measured by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA).</p>
<p>For histological analyses, kidneys were fixed in paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, stained with H&amp;E and evaluated by a renal pathologist, who was blinded to the treatments of the mice. Glomerular injury was scored from 0 to 4 for each glomerulus and each sample involved evaluation of 30 glomeruli, within at least three separate parts of one section. The average of these 30 values was calculated as the injury score of an individual sample.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of kidney samples</title>
<p>Immunohistochemistry for IgG deposition and CD20+ B cell infiltration was performed in paraformaldehyde-fixed kidney sections. After deparaffinizing in xylene, absolute ethanol and 95% ethanol, tissue sections were placed in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and heated at 99.0°C for 20 minutes. Endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited by treatment with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 15 minutes at room temperature. The tissue sections were blocked in goat serum for 20 minutes at room temperature, incubated overnight at 4°C with goat-anti-mouse polyclonal IgG (ICL Lab) or rabbit-anti-human monoclonal CD20 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) antibodies. For CD20 staining, sections were incubated for a further 2 hours at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Abcam) as the secondary detection antibody. Immune reactivity was detected using a DAB kit (Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and then slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. Immunohistochemical staining data were acquired using the OlyVIA system (Olymphus, Southend-on-Sea, UK) and semi-quantitatively analyzed by Image Pro Plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, Rochville, MD, USA).</p>

<title>Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of cytokine expression</title>
<p>Total RNA from splenic lymphocytes was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) and reverse-transcribed using Sensiscript RT Kit (Life Technologies). mRNA expression of mouse GAPDH, BAFF, IL-6, IL-21 and IL-17 was determined by real-time PCR using SYBR Green Master Mix (Life Technologies) using the following primers: GAPDH (forward) <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-AGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTG-3′</named-content>, (reverse) <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-TGTAGACCATGTAGTTGAGGTCA-3′</named-content>; BAFF (forward) <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-CCACCGTGCCTCTGTTTTTG-3′</named-content>, (reverse) <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-TGCGGAGTGATGGGATCATATC-3′</named-content>; IL-6 (forward) <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-CTGCAAGAGACTTCCATCCAG-3′</named-content>, (reverse) <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′- AGTGGTATAGACAGGTCTGTTGG-3′</named-content>; IL-17A (forward) <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-TCAGCGTGTCCAAACACTGAG-3′</named-content>, (reverse) 5′-GACTTTGAGGTTGACCTTCACAT-3′IL-21 (forward) <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-GGGGACAGTGGCCCATAAATC-3′</named-content>, (reverse) <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-TGGAGCTGATAGAAGTTCAGGA-3′</named-content>. Thermocycler conditions included an initial incubation at 95°C for 15 s. This was followed by a two-step PCR program: 95°C for 5 s and 60°C for 30 s for 40 cycles. Each reaction was performed in triplicate. Data were collected and quantitatively analyzed on an ABI PRISM 7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY, USA). The GAPDH gene was used as an endogenous control. The amount of gene expression was then calculated as the difference in cycle threshold (ΔCT) between the CT value of the target gene and β-actin. ΔΔCT is the difference between the ΔCT values of the test sample and the control. Relative expression of target genes was calculated as 2-ΔΔ<italic>CT</italic>.</p>

<title>Flow cytometric analysis of mouse splenic lymphocyte subsets</title>
<p>Mouse spleen cells were isolated by disruption of spleens. Erythrocytes were lysed by hypotonic shock in a potassium acetate solution. Cells were then incubated for 30 min at 4°C with the following antibodies: PercpCy5.5-CD19, PE-CD138 (BD Biosciences) and APC-B220 (Miltenyi, <bold>Teterow</bold>, Germany). Spleen cell suspension data were acquired on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA).</p>

<title>Iguratimod attenuated renal injury and other lupus-related manifestations in MRL/lpr mice</title>
<p>Iguratimod therapy remarkably delayed development of proteinuria in MRL/lpr mice. At the age of 24 weeks, iguratimod-treated mice showed only trace amounts of protein in urine, while control mice began to develop notable proteinuria from 15 weeks of age. At the end of the observation, proteinuria level in iguratimod-treated mice was less than 40% of those in the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108273-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). In accordance with the effects on proteinuria, iguratimod prevented elevation of serum creatinine in MRL/lpr mice in the late stage of the observation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108273.s001">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>

<p>Reflecting the effects on proteinuria, control mice developed large amounts of lymphocyte invasion, creasants, glomerular sclerosis, casts in the tubula and vasculitis in the kidneys; histological assessment scored by a pathologist blindly revealed moderate to severe glomerular damage and signs of perivascular inflammation in all of the control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108273-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). In contrast, the kidneys of iguratimod-treated mice showed much milder glomerular damage (median: 1.615, QR 1.360–3.895 vs. median: 3.385, QR 2.665–4.0, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0376) and perivascular inflammation (median: 1, QR 1–2 vs. median: 2, QR 2–2, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0447) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108273-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Of note, chronic pathological changes, including vascular sclerosis and fibrosis, were present only in control mice, indicating that nephritis progression was restrained by iguratimod.</p>
<p>IgG IHC staining of the kidney tissue revealed marked membranous and subendothelial deposition of IgG immune complexes and occasional staining of capillaries within the glomeruli of vehicle solution-treated mice. In contrast, there was little or no IgG deposition in the glomeruli of mice treated with iguratimod. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108273-g001">Fig 1D</xref>) Semi-quantitative analysis of integrity optical density (IOD) scanning confirmed this result (median: 44.73, QR 13.06–132.5 vs. median: 363.2, QR 254.3–587.1, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108273-g001">Fig 1E</xref>).</p>

<p>All serum immunoglobulin isotype concentrations detected, including IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3, IgM and IgA, were strongly decreased after 8 weeks of iguratimod treatment, while the vehicle-treated control mice developed severe hyperglobulinemia.

<p>Iguratimod treatment also remarkably improved hypocomplementemia, which is another serum marker characteristic of lupus nephritis in MRL/lpr mice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Hunsicker1">[16]</xref> The serum complement C3 levels remained stably high following iguratimod treatment, especially in the late stage of the study.

<title>Absence of overt toxicity</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>SLE is a complicated and treatment-refractory autoimmune disease. Nephritis is the most common complication that may be fatal. In contrast to the high heterogeneity of the disease, current options for disease modifying drug are still limited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Tsokos1">[26]</xref> and new agents for lupus treatment are urgently needed. Here, we describe a novel small molecular weight immunomodulator, iguratimod, which relieves multiple manifestations of lupus-like disease in MRL/lpr mice, including immune nephritis, joint swelling and changes in serological biomarkers. Our findings in a lupus-prone mouse strain suggest the potential therapeutic role of this agent in human SLE.</p>
<p>As a small molecular weight agent, iguratimod showed inhibitory effects on both T cell and B cell functions in previous studies. We found that iguratimod induced T cell response skewing away from Th17 in a CIA model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Du1">[1]</xref> and Luo <italic>et al.</italic> further demonstrated the direct effect of iguratimod on IL-17 signaling. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Luo1">[7]</xref> In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, iguratimod directly inhibited myelin basic protein-specific T cell activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Aikawa1">[27]</xref> Iguratimod also effectively decreased immunoglobulin production by human and mouse B cells and suppressed antibody class switching. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Tanaka1">[9]</xref> In this study, we found that iguratimod significantly reduced the number of B220+ “autoreactive” T cells and plasma cells in the spleen. This suppressive effect was sufficient to significantly reduce hypergammaglobulinemia and anti-dsDNA autoantibodies as major hallmarks of polyclonal autoimmunity in SLE.</p>
<p>We observed decreased B cell infiltration in kidney tissues following iguratimod treatment, which is also observed in several other effective treatments for lupus patients or mice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Cunnane1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Lee1">[29]</xref> It can be speculated that this effect is the result of iguratimod-induced downregulation of BAFF, which seems to be critical for B cell renal infiltration in patients with lupus nephritis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Sun1">[30]</xref> This phenotype is probably with clinical relevance, since B cell infiltration <italic>in situ</italic> is strongly correlated with severe nephritis and poor prognosis in lupus patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Sun1">[30]</xref> Furthermore, elevated levels of the B cell chemoattractant CXCL13 in target tissue or in circulation is positively correlated with disease activation both in patients and mice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Lee1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Schiffer1">[31]</xref> The function of the infiltrating B cells is not clear; however, several studies reporting antibody producing by local plasma cells in the kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Espeli1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Lacotte1">[33]</xref> may shed some light on this issue.</p>
<p>We found that IL-6, BAFF, IL-17A and IL-21 were downregulated by iguratimod in this study. All these cytokines play essential pathogenic roles in autoreactive T cell or B cell activation in MRL/lpr mice, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Rankin1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Kyttaris1">[37]</xref> as well as in lupus patients. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Tsokos1">[26]</xref>. Targeting these cytokines can effectively treat lupus-like disease in mouse models; therefore, inhibition of these cytokines may help to explain the therapeutic effect of iguratimod on nephritis as well as its cellular effects on autoreactive T cell and plasma cell populations. Moreover, IL-6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Kawano1">[23]</xref> and BAFF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108273-Bossen1">[22]</xref> are also essential for the survival of plasma cells, which is crucially dependent on a complex microenvironment – the so-called ‘plasma cell niches’. Hence, modulation of the microenvironment by iguratimod may also contribute to decreasing plasma cell population.</p>
<p>Compared to rheumatoid arthritis, fewer new medicines have been approved for the treatment of SLE in recent years. Our data revealed that iguratimod effectively ameliorates immune nephritis of MRL/lpr mice, as well as other lupus symptoms, with relatively low risk side-effects. Taken together, these findings indicate that investigations of the therapeutic efficacy of iguratimod in human SLE in well-designed clinical studies are warranted.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Iguratimod ameliorated antibody-mediated nephritis in MRL/lpr mice. This agent modified the imbalance in peripheral B cell differentiation probably through a non-antiproliferative mechanism. Our data indicate a potential therapeutic role of iguratimod in lupus.</p>
