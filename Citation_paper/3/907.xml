<title>Background</title>
<p>This study aims to identify that intrathecal (i.t.) injection of dexmedetomidine (Dex) and ropivacaine (Ropi) induces synergistic analgesia on chronic inflammatory pain and is accompanied with corresponding “neuron-astrocytic” alterations.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Male, adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham, control and i.t. medication groups. The analgesia profiles of i.t. Dex, Ropi, and their combination detected by Hargreaves heat test were investigated on the subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of complete Freund adjuvant (CFA) induced chronic pain in rat and their synergistic analgesia was confirmed by using isobolographic analysis. During consecutive daily administration, pain behavior was daily recorded, and immunohistochemical staining was applied to investigate the number of Fos-immunoreactive (Fos-ir) neurons on hour 2 and day 1, 3 and 7, and the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) within the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) on day 1, 3, 5 and 7 after s.c. injection of CFA, respectively, and then Western blot to examine spinal GFAP and β-actin levels on day 3 and 7.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>i.t. Dex or Ropi displayed a short-term analgesia in a dose-dependent manner, and consecutive daily administrations of their combination showed synergistic analgesia and remarkably down-regulated neuronal and astrocytic activations indicated by decreases in the number of Fos-ir neurons and the GFAP expression within the SDH, respectively.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>i.t. co-delivery of Dex and Ropi shows synergistic analgesia on the chronic inflammatory pain, in which spinal “neuron-astrocytic activation” mechanism may play an important role.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Analgesia with local anesthetics (LAs) has been proved to be effective in neuraxial block <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Jones1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Dadure1">[5]</xref>. However, the catastrophic neural complications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Goldman1">[6]</xref> and great impacts on motor function restrict the intrathecal (i.t.) application <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Perrott1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Harsten1">[8]</xref>. Ropivacaine (Ropi) achieves less impact on motor function in a low concentration and favorable safety profile compared with other LAs. However, repeated i.t. Ropi also dose-dependently induces neurotoxicity and triggers neuronal apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Zhong1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Sun2">[11]</xref>. Thus, physicians tend to prefer the “combination analgesia” with low dose of Ropi and another adjuvant that employs different but somehow overlapped mechanism, may lead to the synergistic analgesia, <italic>via</italic> enhancing the shared pathways or complementing the independent pathways.</p>
<p>Dexmedetomidine (Dex), a highly selective α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors (α<sub>2</sub>AR) agonist, exhibits analgesia when systemically administered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Ihmsen1">[12]</xref>. Besides, perineural Dex also facilitates the analgesia of Ropi in peripheral nerve block <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Stone1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Mori1">[14]</xref>. However, there is no experimental evidence concerning the synergistic analgesia of i.t. co-delivery of Dex and Ropi, and also far from being revealed about the underlying mechanisms for their synergism.</p>
<p>The current evidences inspired us that co-delivery of Ropi and Dex might induce synergistic analgesia <italic>via</italic> inhibiting the activity of neurons and astrocytes. First, the analgesic mechanisms for Ropi include blocking fast voltage-gated sodium channels on neuronal axons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Toda1">[15]</xref>, and suppressing glial activations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Toda1">[15]</xref> within the spinal dorsal horn (SDH), etc. Second, studies of others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Chichorro1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Li1">[18]</xref> and ours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Mei1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Wang2">[24]</xref> suggest that crosstalk between neurons and astrocytes contributes to the initiation and maintenance of pain. Third, α<sub>2</sub>ARs are expressed on not only neurons but also astrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Liu1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Xu1">[26]</xref>. Activation of α<sub>2</sub>AR not only reduces noxious stimuli evoked release of nociceptive substances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Bourgoin1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Holz1">[28]</xref> from the primary afferent fibers, but also inhibits the spinal astrocytic activation.</p>
<p>Hence, we designed the current experiment to test the hypothesis that the i.t. co-delivery of Dex and Ropi at lower dosages yields synergistic analgesia and the underlying mechanism correlates with inhibition on the spinal neuron-astrocytic activation.</p>

<title>Animal preparation</title>
<p>Male <italic>Sprague-Dawley</italic> (SD) rats (180–220 g) provided by Experimental Animal Center of the Fourth Military Medical University were housed in standard transparent plastic cages with a 12/12 h light/dark cycle (light on at 08:00 am) under 22–25°C ambient temperature with food and water available. Before experiments, animals were allowed to habituate to the housing environment for 7 d.</p>

<title>Drugs</title>
<p>Dex (Precedex, 200 μg/2 ml ), lidocaine (Lido, 100 mg/5 ml) and Ropi (Naropin, 100 mg/10 ml) were purchased from Nhwa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Jiangsu, China), Hualu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Shandong, China), and AstraZeneca AB. (Sweden), respectively. CFA (10 mg/10 ml) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC.. Artificial cerebral spinal fluid (ACSF: NaCl 124 mM, D-Glucose 10 mM, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1 mM, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 25 mM, MgSO<sub>4</sub> 1 mM, KCl 4.4 mM and CaCl<sub>2</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O 2 mM) was used as vehicle for the i.t. injection and diluting Ropi (100 mg/10 ml) to the target concentrations (1 mg/ml).

<p>Experiment 1 was designed to evaluate the analgesia profiles of i.t. delivery of Dex, Ropi, or their combination (based on the theoretical 50% effective dose (ED<sub>50</sub>) for their combination (ED<sub>50add</sub>)) and identify whether there is synergistic analgesia according to the actual ED<sub>50</sub> for combination (ED<sub>50comb</sub>) by isobolographic analysis. In this section, rats were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: (1) rats receiving i.t. injection with 10 μl of ACSF followed by s.c. injection with 100 μl of saline 1 h later (Saline-Veh group); (2) rats receiving i.t. injection with 10 μl of ACSF followed by s.c. injection with 100 μl of CFA 1 h later (CFA-Veh group); (3) rats receiving different dose regimes of i.t. Dex, Ropi and their combination injection (Dex: 0.5, 1, and 2 μg/200 g; Ropi: 5, 10, and 20 μg/200 g; Dex&amp;Ropi: ED<sub>50add*1/10</sub>, ED<sub>50add*2/10</sub>, ED<sub>50add*4/10</sub> and ED<sub>50add*8/10</sub>) followed by s.c. injection with 100 μl of CFA 1 h later. PWLs to noxious thermal stimuli were measured a 15 min interval until analgesic effect faded away.</p>
<p>Experiment 2 was designed to evaluate the effect of i.t. delivery of ED<sub>50</sub> Dex, ED<sub>50</sub> Ropi, or ED<sub>50comb</sub> Dex&amp;Ropi on pain behaviors and neuron-astrocytic activations. In this section, i.t. delivery of medication or vehicle was made 30 min after s.c. CFA/saline injection. Then, from day 0 to 7, daily pain behavior was tested at 30 min after daily i.t. medication. Rats in this section were sacrificed at 2 h, 1, 3, and 7 d after s.c. CFA injection for Fos immunofluorescence histochemical staining, at 1, 3, 5 and 7 d for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining, and at 3 and 7 d for Western blot.</p>
<p>Supplemental experiments were designed to identify whether repeated i.t. Dex&amp;Ropi caused potential tachyphylaxis or sensitization by investigating the analgesic duration and intensity after repeated i.t. ED<sub>50comb</sub> Dex&amp;Ropi. Open field (OF) and rotarod tests on naïve rats free from CFA injection or pain behavioral observation after maximal dosages of medications (or their combination) delivery were performed to exclude the potential influence on intubation procedure and i.t. medication that might influence motor function and bias our behavioral readout. Besides, pathology on SDH were examined by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining (details were presented in <bold>Supporting Information</bold>).</p>
<p>The dosages of i.t. Dex and Ropi applied in the present study were based on the previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Kimura1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Zhang1">[31]</xref> and our pilot experiment. All behavioral tests were performed during 8–12 am and conducted by an observer blinded to the experimental condition.</p>

<title>CFA-induced chronic inflammatory pain model</title>
<p>Firstly, i.t. intubation was performed under 2% (w/v) sodium pentobarbital anesthesia (45 mg/kg, i.p.) according to our previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Mei1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Mei3">[21]</xref>. Briefly, a midline incision (3 cm) was cut on back of the rat at the level of the thoracic vertebrae. A pre-measured PE-10 tube (ID 0.28 mm and OD 0.61 mm) was passed caudally from T<sub>8</sub> to L<sub>3</sub> level of the spinal cord, fixed at the back of rat’s ears through s.c. tunnel, with 2 cm free end exposed in the upper thoracic region. Only the rats judged as no neurological deficit and presented complete tail and bilateral hind legs paralysis after i.t. Lido (2%, 10 μl) were used in the followed experiments.</p>
<p>After 3 d recovery, CFA-induced pain model was established according to our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Guo1">[32]</xref>. Briefly, rats were re-anesthetized with 2% isoflurane in O<sub>2</sub>, and received s.c. injection with 100 μl of CFA (1 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) or 0.9% normal saline into the plantar side of the left hind paw.</p>

<title>Hargreaves test</title>
<p>Thermal hyperalgesia was investigated using Hargreaves method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Hargreaves1">[33]</xref>. Paw withdrawal in response to noxious thermal stimuli was assessed using an RTY-3 radiant heat stimulator (Xi’an Fenglan Instrumental Factory, Xi’an, China). Rats were placed in plastic boxes on a glass plate for at least 30 min before testing. The time from initiation of the light beam to paw withdrawal was recorded as PWL. The intensity of the beam was set to produce a basal PWL of approximate 14–16 s. A cut-off time of 35 s was set to prevent excessive tissue damage due to repeated application of the thermal stimuli.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence histochemical staining</title>
<p>Rats were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (65 mg/kg, i.p.) and perfused through the ascending aorta with 100 ml of 0.9% normal saline followed by 500 ml of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.2–7.4) containing 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 30% (v/v) picric acid. After perfusion, the L<sub>4-5</sub> spinal segments were removed and postfixed in the same fixative for 2–4 h and then cryoprotected for 48 h at 4°C in 0.1 M PB that contained 30% (w/v) sucrose. After being embedded in an inert mounting medium (OCT; Tissue-Tek; Sakura; Torrance, CA, USA), transverse frozen spinal sections (30 μm thick) were cut in a cryostat (CM1800; Leica, Heidelberg, Germany) and collected serially. The sections were rinsed in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2–7.4) 3 times (10 min each), blocked with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) in 0.01 M PBS containing 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 60 min at room temperature (RT), followed by immunofluorescent labeling.</p>
<p>The sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with one of the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-GFAP antibody (1∶4000; Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA) and rabbit anti-Fos antibody (1∶1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), respectively, in the antibody dilution medium. The medium consisted of 0.01 M PBS (pH 7.4) containing 5% (v/v) normal donkey serum (PBS-NDS), 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.05% (w/v) NaN<sub>3</sub> and 0.25% (w/v) λ-carrageenan. The sections were washed three times with 0.01 M PBS (10 min each) and then incubated for 4 h at 22–25°C with the secondary antibody: Alexa 488 donkey anti-mouse and Alexa 594 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1∶500; Amer Control Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Piscataway, NJ, USA), respectively, diluted in the antibody dilution medium. The specificity of the staining was tested on the sections from another dish by omitting the specific primary antibody. Finally, the sections were obtained using a confocal laser scan microscope (FV1000; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan; 1 μm thick optical section).</p>

<title>Western blot</title>
<p>Rats were sacrificed under deep anesthesia (2% (w/v) sodium pentobarbital, 65 mg/kg, i.p.) and the L<sub>4-5</sub> SDHs were quickly removed and then dissected using the “open book” method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Zhuang1">[34]</xref>. Briefly, the spinal segment was cut into a left and right half from the midline, and the left half was further split into the dorsal and ventral horns at the level of the central canal. The selected region was homogenized with a hand-hold pestle in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer (60 μl/mg tissue) containing proteinase inhibitors. The electrophoresis samples were heated at 100°C for 5 min and loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels with standard Laemmli solutions (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA, USA). After the proteins were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF, Immobilon-P, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), the membranes were placed in a blocking solution containing Tris-buffered saline with 0.02% Tween (TBS-T) and 5% non-fat dry milk, and incubated 60 min under gentle agitation at RT, then 4°C for overnight with mouse anti-GFAP antibody (1∶4000; Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA), or mouse anti-β-actin antibody (1∶5000; Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), respectively. Bound primary antibodies were detected by incubation with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1∶10000; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Piscataway, NJ, USA) for 2 h under gentle agitation at RT. Between each step, the immunoblots were rinsed with TBS-T for 3 times (10 min each). Protein blots’ densities were detected and analyzed in the Bio-Rad ChemiDoc Imaging System (Bio-Rad Laboratories Ltd, USA).</p>

<title>Dose-effect curve and ED<sub>50</sub> calculation</title>
<p>The dosages of i.t. Dex, Ropi, and their combination were transformed into logarithm dose and the non-line fit was performed so as to build the dose-effect curve. Based on the dose-effect cure, the ED<sub>50</sub>s of each agent on analgesia was calculated.</p>

<title>Isobolographic analysis</title>
<p>An isobolographic analysis was further performed to characterize drug interaction according to the method originally described by Tallarida <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Tallarida1">[35]</xref> and in our previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Sun3">[36]</xref>. Both drugs in Experiment 1 achieved comparable levels of anti-nociception so that ED<sub>50</sub> values were used to obtain a theoretical dose-response curve for a fixed-ratio combination of Dex and Ropi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Tallarida1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Sun3">[36]</xref>.</p>
<p>We calculated a theoretical ED<sub>50add</sub> based on the theoretical dose-response curve. Subsequently, an experimental dose response curve was obtained by treating animals with one of the following combination doses: ED<sub>50add*1/10</sub>, ED<sub>50add*2/10</sub>, ED<sub>50add*4/10</sub> and ED<sub>50add*8/10</sub> in a fixed-ratio of 1∶1 for Dex and Ropi. According to this dose-response curve, the ED<sub>50</sub> of combination could be calculated and presented as ED<sub>50comb</sub>. An ED<sub>50comb</sub> less than ED<sub>50add</sub> suggested a synergistic effect of these two agents.</p>

<p>It seems that synergistic inhibition of the neuronal activation contributes to the initiation of the chronic pain, however, what contributes to the long-term synergistic analgesia of Dex and Ropi?

<p>To our knowledge, this is the first report discussing a synergistic analgesia for i.t. Dex and Ropi in a CFA-induced rat chronic pain model. Our data supported that i.t.

Less Fos-ir neurons in pain “initiation phase” as well as remarkably decreased astrocytic activation in “maintenance phase” indicated the overall pain control by i.t. concomitant strategy.</p>

<title>i.t. Dex, Ropi or their combination reduces thermal hyperalgesia via inhibiting neuronal and astrocytic activation in the spinal cord</title>
<p>According to previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Scholz1">[17]</xref> and our experimental data, spinal neuronal activation might be dominant in pain “initiation phase” presented as obvious thermal hyperalgesia with increased Fos-ir neurons within 3 d, particularly in the first 24 h after s.c. CFA injection. On the contrary, astrocytes might be critical in pain “maintenance phase”, since spinal Fos-ir neurons have been down-regulated after “acute phase”, but GFAP up-regulated in “chronic phase” of pain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Wang2">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Katsura1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Zhuang2">[41]</xref>, which presented sustained thermal hyperalgesia to 7 d after s.c. CFA injection. Astrocytes express receptors for various neurotransmitters, which enable them to respond to neural signals and thus be activated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Katsura1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Wirkner1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Thorlin1">[45]</xref>. Activated astrocytes produce numerous mediators such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors that enhance neuronal activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Guo2">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Suter1">[47]</xref>. Using specific metabolic inhibitors for astrocytes such as fluorocitrate, studies have indicated that astrocytic activation is required and sufficient for chronic pain sensitization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Watkins1">[48]</xref>.</p>
<p>Based on previous studies and our experimental data, we hypothesized that the synergistic analgesic mechanisms of i.t. Dex and Ropi might be due to i) both Dex and Ropi block nociceptive stimuli to transmit, leading to the directly inhibition on neuronal activation <italic>via</italic> sodium channels or/and α<sub>2</sub>ARs located on neurons membranes in pain “initiative phase”; ii) Dex might directly inhibit astrocytic activation, and then, interrupt the neuron-astrocyte cross-talk in pain “maintenance phase”; iii) Ropi indirectly inhibits asctrocytic activation deriving from blocking neuronal sensitization or directly suppresses spinal asctrocytic activation in a nerve growth factor (NGF)-independent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Toda1">[15]</xref>, and then, achieves in subsequent synergistic analgesia by interrupting the neuron-astrocytic cross-talk. However, the specific molecular mechanisms require further discussion.</p>
<p>In the current study, we didn’t investigate the time-course and the effects of Dex and Ropi combination on microglia, since our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Mei4">[22]</xref> suggested that the peak activation of microglia was at day 3 in a neuropathic pain model, and thus it might be predominant in “sub-acute phase” instead of “chronic phase”. However, as a critical component of the “cross-talk” between neuron-glia, microglia also participates in the pain cascade. It needs our further work to identify whether microglia plays an important role in pathological pain, as well as the inhibition of microglia contributes to the facilitations of i.t. Dex and Ropi combination on improving chronic inflammatory pain.</p>

<title>i.t. Dex as an adjuvant may be a new analgesic strategy</title>
<p>Previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Werdehausen1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Sites1">[50]</xref> have indicated that LAs had significant neurotoxicity both in <italic>vivo</italic> and in <italic>vitro</italic>. Our results demonstrated that i.t. Dex tended to attenuate Ropi-induced acute neuroinflammation at 24 h after s.c. CFA injection (<bold>Supporting Information</bold>). Recent studies have also confirmed the neuroprotective or growth-promoting properties of Dex in many tissues, such as protecting neurons after stroke by promoting glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Yan1">[51]</xref>, protected cortex neurons from apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Bruzzone1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Sanders1">[53]</xref>, and decreased Lido-induced cortical neuron death indicated by the decreased expressions of caspase-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Zhang1">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although the half-life time of Dex is short (2∼3 h), its anxiolytic, sedative, and analgesic properties of Dex might, at least partly, contribute to this long-lasting and accumulative analgesic effect (24 h) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Grosu1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Huang1">[55]</xref>. These valid analgesic properties were also found in varied pain conditions, such as chronic constrictive injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve-induced neuropathic pain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Liu1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Li2">[56]</xref> and pH 5.0 PBS-induced acute inflammatory pain in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Zhang1">[31]</xref>, as well as bone cancer induced-pain in rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Yuan1">[57]</xref>.</p>
<p>In our isobolographic analysis, an ED<sub>50comb</sub> of 5.26 was less than ED<sub>50add</sub> of 6.93 for Ropi, suggesting a synergistic analgesia. Importantly, reducing the LAs consumption means less neurotoxicity possibility to some extent. Thus, we highlighted that i.t. Dex as an adjuvant has obvious advantages over the individual medications. First, i.t. Dex seems to be an insufficient analgesia profile, while i.t. Ropi lacks long-lasting and accumulative analgesic effect. Second, a synergistic effect of i.t. Dex and Ropi might be beneficial in a long-term treatment because of more comprehensive effect of neuronal and astrocytic inhibition in the course of chronic pain. Third, smaller dosages of each agent may be used to reach equal or better efficacy. Finally, the LAs-induced side effects and motor function impacts would be minimized. More importantly, neurons might benefit from Dex’s protective effect. In this sense, the concomitant administration of Dex and Ropi may serve as a new analgesic strategy.</p>

<title>Barrier between animal research and human application</title>
<p>Barrier lies between animal research and clinical application, and it does be a usual issue that a drug that works well in animals is ostensibly not effective in humans. One often-ignored explanation is the inappropriate translation of a drug dose from one animal species to another. The calculations for determining starting dose in humans as extrapolated from animals should use the more appropriate normalization of body surface area (BSA) than the body weight alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-ReaganShaw1">[58]</xref>.</p>
<p>By using the following formula <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Abbott1">[59]</xref>, we calculated the human equivalent dose (HED) based on our animal study: HED (mg/kg)  =  (mouse dose (mg/kg) * mouse K<italic><sub>m</sub></italic>)/human K<italic><sub>m</sub></italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Abbott1">[59]</xref>.</p>
<p>K<italic><sub>m</sub></italic> factor for rat and adult human being are 6 and 36, respectively.</p>
<p>The translated ED<sub>50comb</sub> of i.t. Dex for a 70 kg adult is 36.59 μg, while the doses of i.t. Dex in clinical trials range largely from 3 to 15 μg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Gupta1">[60]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092374-Kanazi1">[66]</xref>. Thus, we infer that the possible explanations for the discrepancy between animal studies and human trials might be that i) different stimulus intensity lies between surgical procedures or acute post-operative pain and chronic inflammatory pain; ii) higher concentration of LAs commonly applied in medical setting, which might achieve dominant in analgesia; iii) different interaction when i.t. Dex as an adjuvant combining with other specific LAs might contribute to diverse dose <italic>vs</italic> response relationship; iv) rats and human being demonstrates different sensitivity for adrenergic systems mediating by α<sub>2</sub>AR. However, these explanations need further experimental evidence.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our study shows that i.t. co-delivery of Dex and Ropi presents synergistic analgesia on the CFA-induced chronic inflammatory pain, in which spinal “neuron-astrocytic activation” mechanism may play an important role.</p>
