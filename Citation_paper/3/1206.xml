<abstract>
<p>We examined the antileukemic effects of high concentrations of L-ascorbic acid (high AA) on human leukemic cells. In vitro, high AA markedly induced apoptosis in various leukemic cell lines by generating hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) but not in normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. High AA significantly repressed leukemic cell proliferation as well as neoangiogenesis in immunodeficient mice. We then noted that in leukemic cells, <italic>HIF-1α</italic> transcription was strongly suppressed by high AA and correlated with the transcription of <italic>VEGF</italic>. Our data indicate that exposure to high AA markedly increased the intracellular AA content of leukemic cells and inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, which mediates expression of HIF-1α. We next generated K562 cells that overexpressed <italic>HIF-1α</italic> (K562-HIF1α cells) and assessed the mechanistic relationship between inhibition of <italic>HIF-1α</italic> transcription and the antileukemic effect of high AA. The ability of high AA to induce apoptosis was significantly lower in K562-HIF1α cells than in K562 cells in vitro. We found that expression of HIF-1α-regulated antiapoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family, such as Mcl-1, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, and Bcl-2, was significantly suppressed by high AA in K562 cells, but was sustained at higher levels in K562-HIF1α cells, regardless of high AA exposure. Moreover, repression of cell proliferation and neoangiogenesis by high AA was completely abrogated in mice receiving transplants of K562-HIF1α cells. These results indicate that, along with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation, downregulation of <italic>HIF-1α</italic> transcription plays a crucial role in growth inhibition of human leukemic cells by high AA.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pauling and Cameron were the first to report that when L-ascorbic acid (AA) was given intravenously to human cancer patients for 10 days and then orally in pharmacologic doses of 10 g daily, it was effective in treating some cancers and in improving patient survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Cameron1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Cameron2">[2]</xref>. The same oral dose had no therapeutic effects on cancer patients in 2 subsequent double-blind placebo-controlled trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Creagan1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Moertel1">[4]</xref>. However, we thought that it was important to examine anew the role of AA in cancer treatment for the reasons that follow: (i) the route of AA administration leads to large differences in plasma concentrations, and intravenous administration results in 70-times higher plasma concentration than oral administration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Padayatty1">[5]</xref>; (ii) high concentrations of AA (high AA) administered intravenously exert remarkable anticancer effects by generating hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in the extracellular fluid of tumor-bearing animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Chen1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Chen2">[7]</xref>; and (iii) recent clinical studies also demonstrate the antitumor effects of intravenous high AA in patients with different types of cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Padayatty2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Ohno1">[9]</xref>. Further, it is remarkable that the cytotoxic effects of high AA appear to be cancer cell-type specific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Chen2">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the present study, we attempted, therefore, to determine whether high AA exerts significant cytotoxic effects against human leukemic cells in vitro and in vivo. We confirm here that the leukemic cell-specific cytotoxic effects of high AA were caused by the generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Further, while HIF-1α plays an important role biologically and clinically in myeloid and lymphoid leukemias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Wang1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Grlach1">[15]</xref>, we found that high AA strongly inhibited HIF-1α expression in leukemic cells.</p>
<p>HIF-1 is composed of an inducible (HIF-1α) and a constitutively expressed subunit (HIF-1β) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Semenza1">[16]</xref>. HIF-1α contains an oxygen-dependent degradation domain, which when hydroxylated by specific prolyl hydroxylases, binds the von Hippel–Lindau protein, leading to the ubiquitination of HIF-1α and its degradation by the 26S proteasome. At low oxygen levels, the prolyl hydroxylases lose their activity, which prevents hydroxylation and subsequent binding to the von Hippel–Lindau protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Maxwell1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Ruas1">[18]</xref>. This results in HIF-1α stabilization, nuclear translocation, dimerization with the β-subunit, and binding to recognition elements in the promoters of target genes.</p>
<p>AA facilitates the hydroxylation of HIF-1α via the stimulation of the prolyl hydroxylases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Myllyla1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-deJong1">[20]</xref>. However, we have shown here that high AA markedly inhibit the expression of HIF-1α in leukemic cells at the level of transcription. We have further demonstrated that one important mechanism underlying this response is the transcriptional regulation of HIF-1α by the redox-sensitive transcription factor NF-κB, which has been shown to bind at a distinct element in the proximal promoter of <italic>HIF-1α</italic> under not only hypoxic but also non-hypoxic conditions and regulate <italic>HIF-1α</italic> transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-vanUden1">[21]</xref>. Most important, the inhibition of HIF-1α expression is considered to play a crucial role in the antileukemic effects of high AA.</p>

<p>The human leukemic cell lines, K562 (blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia), HL60 (promyelocytic leukemia), MOLM14 (monocytic leukemia), NB4 (promyelocytic leukemia), Jurkat (T-lymphoblastic leukemia), and Raji (B-lymphoblastic leukemia), were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FCS) and antibiotics (100 U penicillin/ml and 100 μg streptomycin/ml) at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. The MOLM-14 cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Matsuo1">[22]</xref> was kindly provided by the Cell Biology Institute, Research Center, Hayashibara Biochemical Laboratories. The NB4 cell line was purchased from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures. The remaining cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. Human umbilical cord blood (CB) samples were harvested from subjects quickly after birth, after written informed consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with approval from the Tokai University Committee on Clinical Investigation. The CD34<sup>+</sup> cell fraction was prepared using the CD34 Progenitor Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Kawada1">[23]</xref>. The CB-CD34<sup>+</sup> cells were frozen in a medium supplemented with dimethylsulfoxide and FCS using a step-down freezing procedure and placed in liquid nitrogen. Aliquots of frozen samples were thawed just before use. The thawed cells were washed twice and viability was determined using trypan blue. When cell viability was more than 95%, the samples were subjected to further studies. To prepare K562 cells that overexpressed HIF-1α, we transfected 293T cells with CSII-HIF1α-IRES-EGFP lentiviral vectors for 72 h and collected the supernatant. K562 cells were incubated with the highly concentrated viral supernatant at a multiplicity of infection of 50 for 24 h. Green fluorescent protein-positive K562 cells were then sorted using a FACSVantage cell sorter (Becton Dickinson).</p>

<title>Cancer-specific cytotoxic effect of high AA on human hematopoietic cells</title>
<p>We first assessed the effect of high AA on the viability of various human leukemic cell lines as well as on normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in vitro. Addition of 280 and 2800 μM of AA, which are approximately 6 and 60-times higher than the physiological level, produced significant amounts of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> after 1 h incubation (34.4±4.1 and 134.0±11.8 μM, respectively) and reduced the viability of all myeloid and lymphoid leukemic cells tested but not that of CB-CD34<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062717-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We further found that high AA induced apoptosis in leukemic cells and that this effect was almost completely abrogated by the addition of catalase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062717-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). It is important to note that the leukemic cell lines tested generally possessed lower catalase activities than did normal CB-CD34<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062717-g001">Figures 1C and 1D</xref>). Thus, we conclude that the induction of apoptosis by high AA was due to the generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and was specifically observed in leukemic cells that expressed relatively lower catalase activities.</p>

<title>Inhibitory effect of high AA on leukemic progression in vivo</title>
<p>We next examined the effect of high AA on the progression of leukemia by using an experimental transplantation model. We mixed HL60 cells and basement membrane matrix (BD Biosciences), transplanted the mixture subcutaneously into the right flank of nude mice, and injected high AA or vehicle intravenously. This procedure enabled a precise assessment of tumor burden over time. There were significant differences in tumor volumes between vehicle- and high AA-treated mice 4 days after the final injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062717-g002">Figures 2A and 2B</xref>).

<title>Inhibitory effect of high AA on HIF-1α expression in leukemic cells</title>
<p>We next determined the expression of angiogenesis-related molecules in CB-CD34<sup>+</sup> and leukemic cells in the presence of vehicle or high AA.

<p>We then attempted to determine how <italic>HIF-1α</italic> mRNA expression was inhibited by high AA in leukemic cells. <italic>HIF-1α</italic> is known to be transcriptionally regulated by NF-κB, and AA inhibits phosphorylation of the NF-κB inhibitor (IκB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Crcamo1">[28]</xref>. Therefore, we tested for the presence of phosphorylated IκB (p-IκB) and found that the p-IκB level in HL60 cells was significantly reduced by the addition of high AA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062717-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). These data indicate that high AA markedly inhibited the translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus of HL60 cells, but not CB-CD34<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062717-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). We demonstrated further that the intracellular content of AA was much higher in leukemic cells than in normal CB-CD34<sup>+</sup> cells after incubation with high AA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062717-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). These results suggest that the differences in the intracellular uptake of AA reflected the differences seen between high AA-treated human leukemic cells and CD34<sup>+</sup> cells derived from normal CB in the presence of NF-κB translocation and following HIF-1α expression.</p>

<title>Relationship between the inhibitory effects of high AA on HIF-1α expression and leukemic progression</title>
<p>Next, we assessed the implications of the inhibition of HIF-1α expression by high AA on leukemic progression by generating <italic>HIF-1α</italic>-overexpressing K562 cells (K562-HIF1α) by using a lentiviral vector. High AA exposure significantly reduced the expression of <italic>HIF-1α</italic> mRNA in K562 but not in K562-HIF1α cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062717-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The level of HIF-1α in K562-HIF1α cells was also significantly higher than that in K562 cells after vehicle or high AA exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062717-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). We also found that the induction of apoptosis by high AA was significantly lower in K562-HIF1α than in K562 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062717-g005">Figure 5C and 5D</xref>). Therefore, we assessed the expression of antiapoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family (Mcl-1, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, and Bcl-2) because their expression is regulated by HIF-1α in nonmalignant and malignant cells. Moreover, they play a key role in preventing apoptosis mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Piret1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Lin1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Jung1">[35]</xref>. We demonstrated that expression of Mcl-1, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, and Bcl-2 was significantly inhibited by high AA in K562 cells but was sustained at a higher level in K562-HIF1α cells, regardless of high AA exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062717-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). We further assessed the involvement of the pro-oncogenic specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 in the antileukemic effect of high AA because high AA exhibits anticancer activity towards colon cancer cells. This is due in part to downregulation of Sp transcription factors and Sp-regulated genes, such as <italic>VEGF</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Pathi1">[36]</xref>. There were significant differences in the expression levels of these molecules between the vehicle-treated K562 and K562-HIF1α cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062717-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). In K562 cells, the expression of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 as well as that of VEGF was reduced by high AA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062717-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). In K562-HIF-1α cells, the expression of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 was reduced by high AA, but the expression of VEGF was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062717-g005">Figure 5F</xref>).</p>

<p>Finally, we mixed K562 or K562-HIF1α cells in basement membrane matrix, transplanted the mixture into mice, and injected the mice intravenously with the vehicle or high AA.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>AA plays a key role in protecting cells against oxidative damage. Paradoxically, in the presence of Fe<sup>3+</sup> or Cu<sup>2+</sup>, AA treatment generates ROS, such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Stadtman1">[37]</xref>, and induces apoptosis or necrosis in various malignant cells but not in nonmalignant cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Du1">[38]</xref>. In the present study, we further investigated these findings and confirmed them using human leukemic and normal hematopoietic cells. We found that high AA induces apoptosis only in the leukemic cells, which we concluded reflects the increasing generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and relatively low catalase activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Riordan1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Nemoto1">[39]</xref>.</p>
<p>We also found that intravenous administration of high AA repressed proliferation of leukemic cells injected into nude mice. Although high AA are usually given by drip infusion in clinical settings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Chen2">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Ohno1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Padayatty3">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Hoffer1">[41]</xref>, we injected mice with high AA in the form of a bolus, which might have weakened the effect of treatment because of more rapid clearance of AA than by drip infusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Padayatty4">[42]</xref>. However, we observed a significant antileukemic effect of high AA in the present study. Further, the tumors showed markedly reduced neoangiogenesis. Our present findings demonstrate that high AA strongly inhibits expression of HIF-1α and one of HIF-1α-regulated molecules, VEGF, in leukemic cells. HIF-1α and VEGF are considered as potential targets for cancer therapy because they play an important role in the progression of many types of cancer, including leukemia, and are associated with resistance to therapy and poor prognosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Wang1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-AbdelWahab1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Semenza2">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Verstovsek1">[45]</xref>. Wang et al. demonstrated that HIF-1α signaling is selectively activated in human leukemic cells even under normoxic conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Wang1">[10]</xref>. AA facilitates the hydroxylation of HIF-1α via the stimulation of the Fe-dependent hydroxylases that mark this protein for polyubiquitination and subsequent proteosomal degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Myllyla1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-deJong1">[20]</xref>. Moreover, Knowles et al. reported that AA reduces HIF-1α protein levels in several human non-hematopoietic cancer cells under normoxic conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Knowles1">[46]</xref>. We have shown here that high AA markedly inhibits the expression of HIF-1α at the level of transcription in leukemic cells.</p>
<p>We have also shown here that in the leukemic cells, high AA inhibited <italic>HIF-1α</italic> transcription by blocking transcriptional activation of NF-κB, which is also constitutively activated in many types of leukemia and is associated with leukemic progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Packham1">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Reikvam1">[49]</xref>. Because the leukemic cells used in this study generally possessed significantly higher intracellular levels of AA than normal hematopoietic cells after incubation with high AA, we speculate that while H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> acts to activate NF-κB by increasing phosphorylation of IκB and <italic>HIF-1α</italic> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Grlach1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Crcamo1">[28]</xref>, AA overcomes the effect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on the regulation of NF-κB activation in the leukemic cells. Further, we conclude that the increased uptake of AA by leukemic cells, also observed by other investigators and possibly associated with an abnormality in AA transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Liebes1">[50]</xref>–, reflects the difference in HIF-1α expression levels between leukemic and normal CB-CD34<sup>+</sup> cells after high AA exposure. The levels of intracellular AA did not closely correlate with the cytotoxic effects of high AA, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062717-g001">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062717-g004">4C</xref>, because the effects were caused largely by the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> that was generated extracellularly by high AA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062717-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>However, we found that <italic>HIF-1α</italic> overexpression completely abrogated the inhibitory effects of high AA on tumor growth and neoangiogenesis in vivo and significantly diminished the induction of apoptosis by high AA in the leukemic cells in vitro. HIF-1α regulates the expression of Bcl-2 family members such as Mcl-1, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, and Bcl-2, which are essential for the growth and survival of leukemic cells because they prevent the induction of apoptosis by ROS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Piret1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Lin1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Glaser1">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-DelPrincipe2">[57]</xref>. Here, we demonstrated that high AA significantly suppressed expression of Mcl-1, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, and Bcl-2, and induced apoptosis in K562 cells but not in K562 cells that overexpressed <italic>HIF-1α</italic>.</p>
<p>We further assessed the involvement of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 in the antileukemic effect of high AA because high AA exhibits anticancer activity towards colon cancer cells, which is due in part to downregulation of Sp transcription factors and Sp-regulated genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Pathi2">[58]</xref>. Similar results have been observed in bladder and pancreatic cancer cells treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or other ROS inducers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Jutooru1">[59]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Jutooru3">[61]</xref>. Further, it has been reported that knockdown or downregulation of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 represses expression of Sp-regulated genes, including <italic>VEGF</italic> and <italic>BCL-2</italic>, inhibits cancer cell growth, and induces apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Jutooru1">[59]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Jutooru3">[61]</xref>. In the present study, the expression levels of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 in K562-HIF1α cells were higher than those in K562 cells, suggesting some interaction between HIF-1α and Sp proteins. Further, the expression of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 was also downregulated by high AA in K562 cells, as was observed in colon cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Pathi2">[58]</xref>. However, in K562-HIF1α cells, the expression of these factors was also downregulated by high AA, but the expression of VEGF and Bcl-2 was not. These results strongly suggest that marked inhibition of <italic>HIF-1α</italic> transcription and expression of HIF-1α-regulated molecules play a crucial role in the antileukemic effects of high AA along with the generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. However, high AA do not specifically affect the transcription of <italic>HIF-1α</italic> because high AA block the activation of NF-κB, which acts as a transcription factor to regulate the expression of genes involved in the response of leukemic cells to extracellular signals such as <italic>HIF-1α</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Braun1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Reikvam1">[49]</xref>. Therefore, other molecular mechanisms might also play a role in the response to high AA treatment.</p>
<p>Because the use of high AA appears to be remarkably safe in clinical settings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Padayatty3">[40]</xref>, it may provide an alternative option for cancer therapy. However, the anticancer effects of high AA vary among cancers or patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Chen2">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Ohno1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Hoffer1">[41]</xref>. It is known that an increased number of leukemic cells, normal erythrocytes, or fibroblasts around leukemic cells inversely correlates with high AA-induced leukemic cell death because of increased catalase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Sestili1">[62]</xref>. Therefore, the volume and localization of cancer cells should be considered to obtain more stable clinical effects of high AA. We think that it is reasonable to conclude that combinations with other drugs that compensate for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> decomposition may also provide a new strategy for eliminating cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062717-Espey1">[63]</xref>.</p>
