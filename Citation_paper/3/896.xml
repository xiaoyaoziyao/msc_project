<abstract>
<p>Phytosterols, besides hypocholesterolemic effect, present anti-inflammatory properties. Little information is available about their efficacy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Therefore, we have evaluated the effect of a mixture of phytosterols on prevention/induction/remission in a murine experimental model of colitis. Phytosterols were administered <italic>x os</italic> before, during and after colitis induction with Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS) in mice. Disease Activity Index (DAI), colon length, histopathology score, <sup>18</sup>F-FDG microPET, oxidative stress in the intestinal tissue (ileum and colon) and gallbladder ileum and colon spontaneous and carbachol (CCh) induced motility, plasma lipids and plasma, liver and biliary bile acids (BA) were evaluated. A similar longitudinal study was performed in a DSS colitis control group. Mice treated with DSS developed severe colitis as shown by DAI, colon length, histopathology score, <sup>18</sup>F-FDG microPET, oxidative stress. Both spontaneous and induced ileal and colonic motility were severely disturbed. The same was observed with gallbladder. DSS colitis resulted in an increase in plasma cholesterol, and a modification of the BA pattern. Phytosterols feeding did not prevent colitis onset but significantly reduced the severity of the disease and improved clinical and histological remission. It had strong antioxidant effects, almost restored colon, ileal and gallbladder motility. Plasmatic levels of cholesterol were also reduced. DSS induced a modification in the BA pattern consistent with an increase in the intestinal BA deconjugating bacteria, prevented by phytosterols. Phytosterols seem a potential nutraceutical tool for gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases, combining metabolic systematic and local anti-inflammatory effects.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recently, there has been a raising an interest towards essential oils and lipid-soluble bioactive compounds from various natural sources among scientists.</p>
<p>Phytosterols and phytostanols are plant derived sterols, structurally related to cholesterol. Phytosterols differ from cholesterol only for the side chain, which contains a methyl (ampesterol) or ethyl (β-sitosterol and stigmasterol) group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Ostlund1">[1]</xref>, while phytostanols lack the Δ<sup>5</sup> double bond in the B ring. Saturated forms of plant sterols (phytostanols) are less represented in nature than the unsaturated forms (terols) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Brufau1">[2]</xref>. Woods and vegetables are the main sources for pharmaceutical phytosterols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Moghadasian1">[3]</xref>. Phytosterols are natural components of human diets, and they are found, mostly, in vegetable oils, cereals, fruits and vegetables, while common dietary sources of phytostanols are corn, wheat, rye, and rice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Moreau1">[4]</xref>. β-sitosterol, the main sterol of several plant species, has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antispasmodic, antioxidant, and antidiabetic activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Baskar1">[5]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Liz1">[6]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Baskar2">[7]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Gilani1">[8]</xref>. Phytosterols have been shown to determine hypocholesterolemic effect, in normal subjects and hypercholesterolaemic subjects, without affecting high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Plat1">[9]</xref>. There is good experimental support for the traditional idea that phytosterols act within the intestinal lumen where they displace cholesterol and balance whole body cholesterol absorption and excretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Ostlund2">[10]</xref>. However, the exact molecular mechanisms responsible for cholesterol-lowering activity of plant sterols/stanols is likely a complex interplay of multiple processes, among which the so called transintestinal cholesterol excretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-DeSmet1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition to their cholesterol lowering efficacy, experimental <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Shishodia1">[12]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Medeiros1">[13]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Vitor1">[14]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-HolandaPinto1">[15]</xref> and clinical <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-DeJong1">[16]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Hallikainen1">[17]</xref> studies have suggested that plant sterols have anti-inflammatory properties. The anti-inflammatory effect of plant sterols has been addressed mainly to atherosclerosis, where inflammation plays a major role in the process of atherogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Libby1">[18]</xref>. However, the anti-inflammatory effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Liz1">[6]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Bak1">[19]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Liz2">[20]</xref> of phytosterols is independent of the hypocholesterolaemic effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Medeiros1">[13]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Othman1">[21]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Arago1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>The inhibition of inflammatory processes is essential to control or prevent various diseases, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), This disorder, which mainly refers to Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis, is a disordered interplay of genetic, microbial and environmental factors leading to the activation of the mucosal immune and non-immune response, resulting in active inflammation and tissue destruction. This disorder, which refers mainly to Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis, has increased, in last years, in several countries. Few studies are available about the effects of phytosterols in experimental model of colitis such as trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) or dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) that has usually been used to generate an animal model which closely mimics Crohn's disease or Ulcerative Colitis, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Shi1">[23]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Melger1">[24]</xref>. The DSS mouse model is a colitis model resembling the colitis occurring in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. These two clinical entities manifest with a similar pattern of symptoms when the disease is expressed in the colon. However, the pathophysiology of both disorders is poorly understood and seems to be different. Many studies have shown the anti-inflammatory effects of phytosterols<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Vitor1">[14]</xref> of β-sitosterol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Lee1">[25]</xref> sterol guggulsterone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Cheon1">[26]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Kim1">[27]</xref> and phytosteryl ferulates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Islam1">[28]</xref> in experimental IBD.</p>
<p>The available literature shows a relatively high degree of variability, making it very difficult to reach a solid conclusion about phytosterols anti-inflammatory effect in IBD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Othman1">[21]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Villaseor1">[29]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-CalpeBerdiel1">[30]</xref>. This variability may be due to the different mode of administration and the presence of other phytochemicals. So far substantiated clinical outcomes are still lacking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Othman1">[21]</xref>. Generally, IBD treatment is based on anti-inflammatory drugs or immunosuppressive drugs such as 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and 6-mercaptopurine respectively and anti-TNFα drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Ko1">[31]</xref>. Most of these drugs show severe side effects that limit their use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Manz1">[32]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Ardizzone1">[33]</xref>.</p>
<p>Various natural products have been shown to safely suppress pro-inflammatory pathways and control IBD in <italic>in vivo</italic> and/or <italic>in vitro</italic> studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Hur1">[34]</xref>. However the health claims of plants, vegetal extracts, natural substances, food supplements and functional foods have to be supported by scientific data and approved by the Food Safely Authorities such as EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) and U.S. FDA (Food and Drug Administration). The investigations so far reported on the anti-inflammatory effect of phytosterols in experimental IBD are either acute observations, spanning an overall 72 hours period from induction of colitis and sacrifice of the animals after 24 hours treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Vitor1">[14]</xref> [or preventive and therapeutic short time studies spanning over a few days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Cheon1">[26]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Kim1">[27]</xref> or longer experiments, but not extending beyond the colitis induction period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Islam1">[28]</xref>. To our knowledge, a longitudinal preventive and therapeutical study about the role of phytosterols in the prevention/induction and remission of inflammation in IBD and has not been reported, neither a study about the possible role ofphytosterols on the IBD related motility disorders.</p>
<p>Aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of a β-sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol and brassicasterol combination on prevention, and remission of clinical symptoms and mucosal healing in a mouse model of DSS induced colitis. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of the phytosterols combination towards colon, ileum and possibly gallbladder functional motility disorders induced by DSS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Aldini1">[35]</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to longitudinally monitor inflammation in the same animals and to evaluated the response to Phytosterols treatment we used [2-deoxy-2-[<sup>18</sup>F]Fluoro-D-glucose(FDG)] micro-Positron Emission Tomography (<sup>18</sup>FDG-microPET) which has been successfully applied in murine models of chemically induced colitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Brewer1">[36]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Hindryckx1">[37]</xref>.</p>

<title>Ethical Statements</title>
<p>The work has been conducted according to the guidelines set forth by EEC Directive 86/609 on the care and use of experimental animals. The protocol for the induction of colitis was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the University of Bologna (Protocol 22/03/10). All studies involving animals are reported in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Kilkenny1">[38]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-McGrath1">[39]</xref>. Animals were housed in a controlled environment (22–24°C), maintained on a standard 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at 07.00 h) and had free access to food and water throughout the study. The total number of animals used in our study was 60 (20 control mice and 40 mice with colitis). Three mice died during the colitis induction; thus, the number of animals used in the experiments was 57. The authors confirm that the protocol was specifically approved by the “Comitato Etico Scientifico per la Sperimentazione Animale” of the University of Bologna and transmitted to the Ministry of Health(artt. 7-8-9 D.Lgs.116/92).</p>

<title>Experimental protocol</title>
<p>A prevention/induction/remission study has been conducted as follows: animals were fed either usual commercial control diet CD (CD group) or the same diet enriched with a phytosterols (Ph) preparation (Solgar, Via Prima Strada, 23 int. 3 - 35129 Padova – Italy). For details about composition of the nutraceutical see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108112.s001">File S1</xref>: About administered Phytosterols (Figure S1 and Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108112.s001">File S1</xref>) (Ph group) throughout the study. Experimental colitis was induced by giving mice drinking water ad libitum containing DSS (MP Biomedicals, Solon; OH, USA; m.w. 36.000–50.000) (5g%, v/w), w/v) from day 14 to day 24 in both groups Colitis was induced starting at day 14until day 24 by oral administration of DSS (5g%, v/w), w/v) in drinking water in both groups. Thereafter, mice either continued the usual diet or the Phytosterols enriched diet over 14 days. Throughout the experiment, the Disease Activity Index (DAI) was evaluated every other day. Before, during and after colitis induction (5 and 10 day) and after days 14 mice were fed with either phytosterols or control diet, 3–5 mice of each group were sacrificed and the following parameters were evaluated: colon length, intestinal histology, ileal, colonic and gallbladder motility, ileal and colonic oxydative stress. At the beginning of the study, after 14 days either CD or Ph added diet, after 10 days DSS administration and 14 days after stopping DSS (each group continuing its own diet) <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG) micro Positron Emission Tomography (microPET) was performed in at least 6 animals from each group. At the same time intervals, 3–5 mice of each group were sacrificed and the intestinal histology, ileal, colonic and gallbladder motility, ileal and colonic oxidative stress, plasma, lipids and glucose were evaluated. Plasma, liver and biliary bile acids (BA) were studied immediately after mice were fed with CD and Ph and at the end of the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108112-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Overview of experimental design.</title>
<p>Since at time points indicated by arrows 3–5 animals of each group were sacrificed, a total of 10 mice in the Ph group and 6 mice in the CD group (4 died) for each group completed the study. Mice receiving Ph for 14 days (day 0–14) were used to examine the Prevention of DSS induced colitis by Ph and compared with mice consuming CD. Mice receiving DSS from day 14 to day 24 and Ph were used to examine the response to Ph during the acute phase. Mice receiving Ph over 10 days after DSS was stopped and substituted for with water were used to evaluate the remission induced by Ph.</p>

<p>Twenty four hours before the experiments, food supply was withdrawn, while water was maintained <italic>ad libitum</italic>. The animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Immediately before the sacrifice, blood was withdrawn by cardiac puncture and collected in heparinized tubes and plasma was frozen at −80°C for BA analysis. The abdomen was opened by median laparotomy and exposed. The gallbladder was visualized, the cystic duct tied and dissected from the common bile duct. Bile was removed with an insulin syringe (29G) and stored at −80°C until BA analysis. The removed gallbladder was immediately used for motility studies.</p>
<p>The portion of jejunum, immediately after the ligament of Treitz (ligamentum suspensoriun duodeni) was removed (1.5 cm) and retained for histological examination. A 1.5 cm length segment of the terminal ileum, immediately proximal to the ileo-cecal valve and a 2.5 cm region of the distal colon were identified, gently flushed with Krebs solution to remove fecal residues and dissected into two parts: one part was placed in 10% formalin for subsequent histological analysis, a second was retained for immediate in vitro motility studies (see below) or frozen at −80°C for oxydative stress analysis. A liver sample (2g) was collected and frozen at −80°C for BA analysis.</p>

<title><sup>18</sup>F-FDG micro PET</title>
<p>Mice were housed under conditions of controlled temperature (24°C–26°C). Imaging studies were performed using a small animal PET tomograph (GE, eXplore Vista DR) using <sup>18</sup>fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) for glucose metabolism and a CT system (microCT eXplore Locus, GE). <sup>18</sup>F-FDG was synthesized in an automatized module (FASTlab, GE Healthcare). Both PET and the CT system were designed for small animals. Synthesis and quality control of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG were routinely performed in the Technological Unit of the S. Orsola Hospital in Bologna. Animals were fasted 16 hours and water was allowed <italic>ad libitum</italic> before the scanning procedure, and colon was washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution, as for colonography <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Durkee1">[44]</xref>. <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET was carried out as follows: mice were anaesthetized (Sevofluorane 3–5% and oxygen 1 l/min) and injected with 20 MBq of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG, in a volume of 0.1 ml, via the tail vein with an insulin syringe (24 gauge). Mice were subsequently allowed to wake up for the uptake period (60 min), during which they were allowed to move freely. The residual dose was measured to verify the effective dose injected. Finally, anesthesia was induced a second time in the same way for performance of the scan. Each anesthetized animal was placed on the scanner bed in the supine position. Images were acquired for a total acquisition time of 15 min. As the axial field of view was 4 cm, one bed position was sufficient to cover the parts of interest. Once the scan had been completed, the gas anesthesia was stopped and the animal was kept in controlled temperature conditions until recovery. <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET images were reconstructed iteratively (3D FORE 2D OSEM function) with the software of the PET tomograph (GE, eXplore Vista DR), than read in three planes (axial, sagittal and coronal). Scan was considered positive when regions of increased (ROIs) of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake were present in sites consistent with the site of inflammation. Semi-quantitative analysis (maximum standardized uptake time, SUV max) of tracer uptake was calculated in the hottest area within the colon as follows:<disp-formula id="pone.0108112.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0108112.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>Data are presented as means ± SE of n experiments.

<p>Appropriate tension was applied to each muscle strip, then equilibrated for 1 h. Concentration-response curves were constructed by cumulative addition of the agonist (carbachol). Cumulative concentration-response curves to Carbachol (CCh) were constructed by cumulative addition of the agonist. The concentration of agonist in the organ bath was added only after the response to the previous addition had attained a maximal level and remained steady. Contractions were recorded by means of displacement transducer (FT. 03, Grass Instruments, Quincy, MA) using Power Lab software (ADInstruments Pty Ltd, Castle Hill, Australia). Concentration–response curves to agonist were obtained at 30 min intervals, the first one being discarded (ileum and distal colon) and the second one used as control. A new concentration-response curve to agonist was obtained after incubation with the antagonist (Atropine). Tension changes were recorded isotonically for ileum and distal colon. In all cases, parallel experiments in which tissues did not receive any antagonist were run in order to check any variation in sensitivity.

<p>The clinical symptoms and histopathological changes found were consistent with acute colitis. In contrast to C57BL/6 mice where a short 5-day exposure of DSS is sufficient to induce progressive chronic colitis, at the same schedule, BALB/c mice develop acute colitis, which resolves after DSS removal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Melger1">[24]</xref>. In the present investigation we have used dose of DSS higher than the usual dose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Melger1">[24]</xref>, to induce more severe acute histological damage and a longer reparation time, in order to closely evaluate over time the reparation or healing process. The food daily intake was similar in the usual CD and in the Ph added diet animals. A combinatorial DAI, considering body weight loss, stool consistency and stool blood, was used to evaluate the activity of the disease and the response to treatment. DAI during acute colitis induction and remission is reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108112-g002">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<p>Ph administration did not prevent the onset of colitis, but were effective in significantly decreasing severity of colitis and improvingremission. Appearance of fresh emitted stools varied from frank bloody diarrhea to amorphous moist pellets with blood. When a mouse didn't show abnormal feces for at least 4 days before the sacrifice it was discharged. At the end of the induction period, the animals that did not develop loss of at least 10% of the initial weight were discharged. A mortality rate of 4% and 0% was observed respectively in the control diet animals and in the animals assuming Ph. At the autopsy, all the deceased animals showed marked distention of the abdomen and colon with massive endoluminal bleeding and in one case perforation of the colon.</p>
<p>Length of the colon: in CD mice, the colon length was 7.6±0.2 cm; in Ph group, the colon length was not different (7.6±0.3 cm); after acute colitis induction, the colon length was reduced to 6.1±0.2 cm (<italic>P</italic>&lt;.01) and to 6.4±0.2 (<italic>P</italic>&lt;.01) respectively in CD and Ph group (<italic>P</italic>&lt;.05). When mice were fed phytosterols over 14 days after stopping DSS, an increase in colon length (7.4±0.2 cm) (<italic>P</italic>&lt;.01) was observed. In CD mice, 14 days after DSS, the colon length was also increased (6.9±0.1 cm) (<italic>P</italic>&lt;.01).

<p>Plasma: unconjugated BA predominated in both groups, T-conjugated BA accounted for a small fraction of plasma BA. The small amount of Taurine conjugated BA in serum is dependent on the intestinal input of bile acids deconjugated by intestinal bacteria. In CD and Ph fed animals plasma bile acids were very low; Ph induced a decrease in CDCA; after induction of DSS colitis, in CD fed mice, there was a significant increase in plasma BA, mainly unconjugated muCA, DCA and UDCA. In Ph fed mice, after induction of colitis, plasma bile acids were not increased with respect to Ph prevention period and DCA almost disappeared in plasma. Total BA were significantly lower than in CD group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108112-g006">Figure 6A and B</xref>).</p>
<p>In the liver of Ph fed mice, the BA pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108112-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) and concentration were similar in Ph mice, both before and after DSS, with values similar to those found in CD fed mice before colitis induction, with TCA being the predominant BA. After DSS, an increase in BA liver concentration was observed in the CD group, accounted for mainly by TCA and TDCA, the product of 7α intestinal bacteria deconjugation.</p>
<p>In bile, TCA predominated in Ph mice while TmuCA and TCA were the main BA in CD mice; after DSS, TCA increased in CD group, with an opposite trend in the Ph group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108112-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). In particular, TDCA increased in the CD group after DSS, but decreased in the Ph group.</p>
<p>The results demonstrate that DSS induced colitis is associated with an increase of secondary bile acids, due to the increased bacterial 7α-dehydroxylation, resulting from inflammation, which can be partly prevented by phytosterols.</p>

<p>In control diet fed mice, ileal spontaneous contractions in the ileum were constant in amplitude and frequency. Ph did not modify amplitude and frequency of phasic basal ileal contractions. In control mice treated with DSS,partly organized waves characterized by decreased amplitude and increased frequency were observed. DSS treatment in Ph fed mice resulted in a slight decrease in frequency, with a constant amplitude of phasic contractions. DSS suspension did not restore the motility pattern in control diet fed mice, while Ph almost restored the primitive pattern. Therefore Ph seems to protect against the DSS induced disturbance in basal control pattern.

<p>The colon of both CD and Ph groups presented similar phasic contractions of regular amplitude and frequency. DSS almost abolished the phasic contractions in the colonic strips, reducing both amplitude and frequency. After DSS suspension a partial recovery in amplitude, but not in frequency of the contractions was observed.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we have proven, for the first time, the effect of phytosterols on prevention, induction and remission of IBD using a murine model of acute colitis induced by DSS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Strober1">[54]</xref>.</p>
<p>Recently, several studies have demonstrated that remission in patients with IBD should be defined not only by clinical improvement and by “normal appearance” of the intestinal mucosa at the endoscopy but also by achievement of mucosal healing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Vaughn1">[55]</xref>.</p>
<p>Colonic inflammation was evaluated by histological findings and microPET due to the high correlation of microPET and histological score, demonstrated in adoptive transfer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Heylen1">[56]</xref> and DSS induced colitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Hindryckx1">[37]</xref>. The comparison between histology and FDG microPET shows that increased neutrophil infiltration in the mucosa can be the cellular basis of the increased FDG signal in acute DSS-colitis. Of note, in the present investigation we have found a significant (<italic>P</italic>&lt;.01) higher FDG uptake in the colon from Ph fed mice than in CD fed mice in the prevention period, consistently with a significantly greater metabolic activation of the organ. A low-grade activity is often found in the colon due to a combination of physiological factors, including normal intraluminal activity, i.e. bacterial metabolism, lymphoid tissue uptake, and smooth muscle uptake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Perlman1">[52]</xref>.</p>
<p>This low grade activation induced by Ph which we have showed exerting a protective effect against the DSS induced damage, and to regulate the intestinal microflora (see below) and mucosal activity can be one among the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of phytosterols in mice induced experimental colitis.</p>
<p>In both the remission and induction phase, there were significant differences between the Ph and CD group. The induction phase was associated with body weight loss, visible fecal blood, diarrhea, and other histopathological changes such as ulcerations, polymorphonuclear cells and MNC infiltration, loss of epithelial structures. In the remission phase (after DSS suspension), an improvement of clinical symptoms was associated to histopathological findings of reduction of the inflammatory infiltrate as well as reparation of epithelial structure in both groups, but significantly accelerated in Ph fed mice, where incipient healing was observed. Therefore, Ph pretreatment, if it does not prevent the onset of colitis, significantly decreases its clinical severity in the acute phase and reduces tissue inflammation and improves significantly mucosal healing duringremission. The colon of the DSS-treated mice showed complete destruction of the epithelial architecture with extensive depletion of goblet cells in the mucosa, disordered gland architecture loss of crypts, cryptic abscesses, submucosal edema, and intense inflammatory cellular infiltration in all layers. Pretreatment with phytosterols attenuated the morphologic damage and reduced the infiltration of leukocytes, in addition to decreasing mucosal disruption. In the remission phase, in the CD group a reduced inflammatory infiltrate was observed, while in the Ph group the reparation was almost complete with mucosal healing. Since Ph pretreatment reduces mucosal inflammation and the infiltration of leukocytes in the DSS-induced colitis, it is conceivable that another mechanism underlying the protective effects of phytosterols involves a reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells into the colonic mucosa both in the induction and in the remission phase. The accumulation of inflammatory cell infiltrates such as neutrophils contributes to reactive oxygen species production that triggers the destruction of tissues. It could be nice to speculate: leucocytes trafficking? Maybe through remodeling of the epithelium?</p>
<p>To evaluate the level of inflammation as index of severity of disease, we also determined the levels of reactive metabolites of oxygen and nitrogen. Inflammation causes an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species with damage by oxidizing proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and other cellular components. In particular, the lipid peroxidation can alter membrane permeability and function. MDA levels, indicative of increased oxidative damage to lipids, were increased in the colon and ileum in mice in the induction phase, and decreased in the remission phase. MDA levels were significantly higher in the CD than in Ph group. Ph pretreatment, even if it does not completely prevent the oxidative stress associated to the acute phase of the disease, was effective in the reduction of the lipids oxidative damage. The lower MDA levels found in the intestinal tissues of Ph fed mice compared to the levels found in CD fed mice are consistent with the micro PET results and the clinical evaluation of the disease. Therefore, we suggest that Ph, together with the inflammatory condition, would simultaneously change the oxidative state in DSS-induced inflammation.</p>
<p>Therefore Ph exert their activity both through a stabilization of the membrane structure, thus preventing lipid peroxidation, and through their antioxidant properties, thereby conferring protection against DSS damage Recent observations indicate that phorbol esters-stimulated macrophages, from Ph fed rats, release lower amounts of the superoxide anion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Moreno1">[57]</xref>. Many studies indicate that ordered lipid domains (rafts) composed of relatively saturated lipids (sphingolipids) and sterol play important roles in many biological processes. Moreover, it is known that phytosterols are poorly absorbed from food and that they are present in human membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-DeJong2">[58]</xref>, either increasing total sterols concentration or, more possibly, replacing cholesterol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-HcWydro1">[59]</xref>. So far, there are not conclusive data whether incorporation of phytosterols in membranes influence their properties and alter their function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Naito1">[60]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Demonty1">[61]</xref>. It is known that oxidative stress may induce a reduction in Coenzyme Q levels that, beyond its central role in bioenergetic metabolism, is also a powerful antioxidant. For this reason we have measured the CoQ<sub>9</sub> (the predominant form in rodents) tissue concentration in colon specimens. CoQ<sub>9</sub> levels appeared to be unaffected by acute colitis induction both in presence or in absence of phytosterols pre-treatment. However, the slight tendency to increased levels of CoQ9 in inflamed tissues can be due to a compensatory mechanisms allowing its recruitment from circulating lipoproteins. In conclusion, the oxidative stress can decrease the tissue levels of Co-enzyme C9, but the increased blood supply in the inflamed tissue can provide further Co-enzyme C9, balancing the decrease.</p>
<p>Since animal models of colitis have shown defects in motility, we wondered whether phytosterols exert their protective effect also towards intestinal motility alterations occurring in IBD. Interestingly, our study revealed that DSS induces a disturbance in basal and stimulated gallbladder motility that is not completely normalized by DSS suspension. phytosterols exert a protective effect on gallbladder spontaneous and CCh induced motility. Since phytosterols cannot exert a direct effect on the gallbladder muscular layers, this finding is intriguing.</p>
<p>While gallbladder emptying has long been known to be stimulated by cholecystokinin (CCK), released from the proximal duodenum in response to feeding, gallbladder filling regulation is poorly understood. Quite recently, Intestinal Human Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF)19 and its mouse orthologue FGF15, released from the ileum after a meal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Choi1">[62]</xref>, as a result of ileal Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) activation has been shown to oppose CCK effects. Besides FGF15(19), TGR5 expressed in muscular gallbladder cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Lavoie1">[63]</xref> causes gallbladder smooth muscle relaxation, independently of CCK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Li1">[64]</xref>. Since both FXR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Makishima1">[65]</xref> and TGR5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Maruyama1">[66]</xref> are strongly activated by DCA, it is possible that decreased gallbladder motility in DSS treated mice is due to the increase in DCA.</p>
<p>Before DSS treatment, in the Ph group, plasma DCA levels, the product of 7α-deconjugation of CA by intestinal bacteria, were higher than in the CD group, consistent with an increase of intestinal deconjugating bacteria induced by phytosterols. This latter finding is in agreement with the higher<sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake in the Ph than in the CD group before DSS administration (see above).</p>
<p>After DSS, in CD fed mice, DCA increased compared with the Ph group, showing that DSS is associated with a severe bacterial colonization, partly prevented by phytosterols, which can exert their protective activity through a regulatory effect of the intestinal microbiota. It is well-known that colonic contractility is reduced in IBD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Grossi1">[67]</xref> and the disturbance is persistent after the resolution of inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Wells1">[68]</xref>. The decreased motor function is due both to receptor-dependent and receptor-independent mechanisms. We have shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Aldini1">[35]</xref> in a previous study and in the present investigation that impaired spontaneous and induced motor function is present also in the non inflamed ileum. Since the enteric nervous system is deranged in patients with IBD, with abnormalities of different degree, it has been postulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Villanacci1">[69]</xref> that these abnormalities may impair the neurophysiological architecture. In TNBS guinea pig ileitis, ileal inflammation alters the enteric reflex circuits in non-inflamed regions of the intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-OHara1">[70]</xref> and these modifications are considered responsible for the altered function in non-involved segments during episodes of intestinal inflammation. DSS colitis represents a different model from TNBS ileitis, but similarly to the TNBS model, the motor disturbances are present also in non inflamed intestinal segment both in the spontaneous phasic activity and in the stimulated muscular contractions. This study has determined that phytosterols prevents alterations on basal phasic contractions in the ileum in both the acute and remission phase. In the colon, DSS colitis almost abolishes the spontaneous phasic contractions. phytosterols, reducing inflammatory cells infiltration and decreasing oxydative stress, protect from colonic muscle relaxation.</p>
<p>The latter finding is of relevance since small bowel distension can be a predictor of toxic megacolon and, when persistent, it has been reported to be a risk of possibly multiorgan dysfunction (‘impending’ megacolon) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Hokama1">[71]</xref>. In the acute phase of colitis, the response of the ileal and colonic muscle strips to the cholinergic agent carbachol is decreased both in CD fed mice and in Ph mice. During reparation, the response to carbachol is decreased in CD fed mice in both the intestinal segments, but it is surprisingly increased in both the tracts in Ph fed mice. The increase of the response both to CCh and atropine highly supports the thesis of a rise in amount of the number (up regulation) of Cholinergic receptors on the muscle membrane. Muscarinic receptors are present throughout the gut in the muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Kerr1">[72]</xref> and epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Hirota1">[73]</xref> and their activity is dependent on the integrity of the cell membrane and it is impaired by intestinal infection and inflammation. Numerous studies have shown that intestinal infection and inflammation impair the muscarinic cholinergic response of the gut epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Hirota1">[73]</xref>.</p>
<p>A complex network of factors regulates healing of the epithelium and the restitution of epithelial barrier function among which the activation of M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) both in IBD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Khan1">[74]</xref> and in mouse model of colitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Khan2">[75]</xref>. A reduced number of M1mAChR has been found in inflamed areas and evidence has been produced that the reduction of mAChRs can be a fundamental mechanism of inflammatory cholinergic hyporesponsiveness. In the present work we have shown that phytosterols restore the responsiveness of the inflamed intestine to CCh and atropine. Since atropine is a potent non selective muscarinic receptor antagonist not targeting M1 mAChR only, the increaed response to atropine can be due to an increased number of atropine receptors. This finding supports the concept that phytosterols can also act at the level of the cholinergic system.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Although phytosterols anti-inflammatory properties are well known and already described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Shishodia1">[12]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Medeiros1">[13]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-Vitor1">[14]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-HolandaPinto1">[15]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108112-DeJong1">[16]</xref>, the absence of information on proinflammatory cytokines and mediators in blood and intestinal tissue is a major limitation of this study, since different sterols and a different dosage were employed. Further limitation of the present investigation is the murine model and the non reliability of these results for humans, the lack of a confirm of phytosterols effect in a spontaneous setting rather than the induced colitis, and the very small sample size. Despite these drawbacks, our study shows for the first time that phytosterols pretreatment reduces the clinical symptoms and exerts a protective effect on DSS induced colonic inflammation decreasing infiltration of inflammatory cells and accelerating mucosal healing. These effects can be related to their antioxidant effects and to a regulation of the intestinal microflora, as indirectly shown by the modification in the bile acid pattern.phytosterols play also a role in the restoration of the intestinal motor pattern. These findings pavethe way towards the role of phytosterols as potential nutraceutical tools in the management of IBD and other intestinal inflammatory diseases.</p>
