<abstract>
<p>Recent research has demonstrated the feasibility of combining functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and graph theory approaches to explore the topological attributes of human brain networks. However, the test-retest (TRT) reliability of the application of graph metrics to these networks remains to be elucidated. Here, we used resting-state fNIRS and a graph-theoretical approach to systematically address TRT reliability as it applies to various features of human brain networks, including functional connectivity, global network metrics and regional nodal centrality metrics. Eighteen subjects participated in two resting-state fNIRS scan sessions held ∼20 min apart. Functional brain networks were constructed for each subject by computing temporal correlations on three types of hemoglobin concentration information (HbO, HbR, and HbT). This was followed by a graph-theoretical analysis, and then an intraclass correlation coefficient (<italic>ICC</italic>) was further applied to quantify the TRT reliability of each network metric. We observed that a large proportion of resting-state functional connections (∼90%) exhibited good reliability (0.6&lt; <italic>ICC</italic> &lt;0.74). For global and nodal measures, reliability was generally threshold-sensitive and varied among both network metrics and hemoglobin concentration signals. Specifically, the majority of global metrics exhibited fair to excellent reliability, with notably higher <italic>ICC</italic> values for the clustering coefficient (HbO: 0.76; HbR: 0.78; HbT: 0.53) and global efficiency (HbO: 0.76; HbR: 0.70; HbT: 0.78). Similarly, both nodal degree and efficiency measures also showed fair to excellent reliability across nodes (degree: 0.52∼0.84; efficiency: 0.50∼0.84); reliability was concordant across HbO, HbR and HbT and was significantly higher than that of nodal betweenness (0.28∼0.68). Together, our results suggest that most graph-theoretical network metrics derived from fNIRS are TRT reliable and can be used effectively for brain network research. This study also provides important guidance on the choice of network metrics of interest for future applied research in developmental and clinical neuroscience.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The human brain is a highly complex system that can be represented as a structurally or functionally interconnected network that assures rapid segregation and integration of information processing. Considerable progress has recently been made in describing the topological organization of human whole-brain networks using neuroimaging data and graph-theoretical approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Bullmore1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Bullmore2">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-He1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Rubinov1">[4]</xref>. A wealth of research has demonstrated that human structural or functional brain networks can be constructed using a variety of non-invasive neuroimaging techniques, including structural MRI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-He2">[5]</xref>, diffusion MRI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Gong1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Hagmann1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Hagmann2">[8]</xref>, blood oxygenation level dependent functional MRI (BOLD-fMRI) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Achard1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-He3">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Salvador1">[11]</xref>, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Niu1">[12]</xref>. Graph theory analysis has further revealed that these brain networks exhibit many non-random topological properties, such as small-world efficiency, modularity and highly connected hubs. These quantitative topological properties have been found to change with normal development, aging and disease conditions (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-He3">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Bassett1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Pievani1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Wang1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Xia1">[16]</xref>).</p>
<p>Compared to traditional functional imaging techniques such as BOLD-fMRI, fNIRS is a newly developed but promising neuroimaging technology that uses light in the near-infrared spectrum (670–900 nm) to noninvasively monitor cortical hemodynamic variations induced by neural activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Jobsis1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Villringer1">[18]</xref>. The primary advantages of fNIRS over other neuroimaging techniques include portability, effective cost, ecological validity and higher temporal resolution. One of the main contributions of fNIRS research is the detection of resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC), which chara<bold>c</bold>terizes the synchronization of spontaneous neural activity between spatially remote brain regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Homae1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Lu1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Mesquita1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-White1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-White2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Zhang1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Zhang2">[25]</xref>. Very recently, we proposed resting-state fNIRS (R-fNIRS) and graph-theoretical approaches to explore the topological architecture of human whole-brain functional networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Niu1">[12]</xref>. In the R-fNIRS based network analysis framework, the channels are considered vertices, and RSFCs between channels are considered edges. Using this approach, we previously demonstrated that R-fNIRS can effectively characterize the topological attributes of human brain networks, such as small-world efficiency, modularity and highly connected hubs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Niu1">[12]</xref>. The results of this study were also consistent with recent findings from BOLD-fMRI research, suggesting the feasibility and validity of combining R-fNIRS and graph theory analysis to identify the functional properties of human brain networks. However, it still remains largely unknown whether the topological brain network measures derived from R-fNIRS data are repeatable or test-retest (TRT) reliable. If these metrics can be consistently replicated, they have the potential to be adopted as biomarkers in further cognitive neuroscience and clinical research. This could prove important in longitudinal studies of brain changes and in research using repeated measurements in the context of normal development or even pharmacological treatment. Consequently, it is an important and necessary task to explore the TRT reliability of functional brain networks derived from human R-fNIRS data.</p>
<p>In the present study, we aimed to provide a comprehensive assessment of the TRT reliability of graph metrics for R-fNIRS brain networks. To this end, we collected human R-fNIRS data in a group of healthy young adults over two sessions with a 20-minute interval between sessions. For each participant, we constructed whole-brain functional networks by computing temporal correlations between the time series of pairs of channels based on hemoglobin concentration. We further analyzed three sets of network properties (functional connectivity, global network metrics and regional nodal metrics) using graph-theoretical approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Niu1">[12]</xref>. Finally, intraclass correlation coefficients (<italic>ICC</italic>) were calculated to assess the TRT reliability of these network metrics.</p>

<title>Subjects and protocol</title>
<p>Twenty-one healthy right-handed subjects (mean age: 24.5 years; range: 21–27 years; 17 male) participated in this study. All subjects were college students recruited from Beijing Normal University. The study was approved by the Review Board at the State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Beijing Normal University, and written informed consent was obtained from each subject prior to the experiment. Each participant underwent two eleven-minute sessions of resting-state fNIRS scanning separated by an interval of twenty minutes. Participants were instructed to remain still during scanning and to keep their eyes closed without falling asleep. During the rest interval, participants were instructed to sit still while wearing the probe holder, but they were allowed slight body and head motion. The signal quality from all measurement channels will be separately checked before the performance of the second session for each participant. If the signal at one or several channel(s) showed low signal-to-noise ratio, the whole probe holder or the specific source-detector pair determining the defective measurement channel will be readjusted.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Data acquisition and preprocessing</title>
<p>The data were acquired using a continuous wave (CW) near-infrared optical imaging system (CW6, TechEn Inc., MA, USA) equipped with 12 laser sources and 24 detectors designed to cover almost the entire head, including the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. The probe arrays allowed for 46 different measurement channels, with 3.2 cm of source-detector separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072425-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The positioning of the probes was based on the international 10–20 system, and the positions were measured at each scanning session to establish consistent placement. Specifically, two detectors around channels 17 and 18 were placed in T3 and T4, and the midpoint of the two detectors was localized in Cz. The system generated two wavelengths of near-infrared light (690 and 830 nm) and measured changes in the concentrations of oxyhemoglobin (HbO) and deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) based on the modified Beer-Lambert law <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Cope1">[26]</xref>. The sum of the HbO and HbR signals was defined as the total hemoglobin (HbT) concentration. Considering that the spontaneous fluctuations of each concentration data usually include various non-neural signals (e.g., respiratory and cardiac noises), we thus adopted a band-pass filtering with cutoff frequencies of 0.009 and 0.08 Hz to reduce the effects of these noises <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-White2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Biswal1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Sasai1">[28]</xref>, which was similar to previous resting-state fMRI study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Fox1">[29]</xref>. Three subjects were excluded due to poor contact between the probe and scalp, leaving 18 subjects on which further analysis was performed. To obtain a stable signal, the first minute of each hemodynamic time series was discarded. The sampling rate for the optical signal was set to 25 Hz, which resulted in 15,000 sample points for each 10-min dataset for each subject.</p>

<title>Network construction</title>
<p>In a previous study, we developed a procedure to construct whole-brain functional networks based on R-fNIRS data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Niu1">[12]</xref>. Briefly, RSFC was calculated with Pearson correlation analysis between the time series of every pair of nodes, where nodes were measurement channels. This resulted in a {46×46} correlation matrix for each participant at each session. The correlation matrix was then thresholded into a binary matrix that described the topological organization of the functional networks. As in our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Niu1">[12]</xref>, we chose sparsity (<italic>S</italic>) as a threshold measure, and sparsity was defined as the number of actual connections divided by the maximum possible number of connections in the network, ranging from 0.01 to 0.99 at an interval of 0.01.</p>

<title>Test-retest reliability analysis</title>
<p>The intraclass correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the test–retest reliability of R-fNIRS brain networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Shrout1">[40]</xref>. To comprehensively investigate the test–retest reliability of the graph theory-derived R-fNIRS network, we analyzed the reliability of R-fNIRS network properties from three perspectives: resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC), global network metrics and regional nodal centrality metrics. For each metric, the individual RSFC or network parameters values of all subjects in both two sessions were first merged into one 18×2 matrix, with rows corresponding to participants and columns corresponding to repeated measurements in two sessions. Notably, for RSFC, the 18×2 matrix represents the connection strength between any two nodes across two sessions; for network metrics, each 18×2 matrix represents the global or nodal parameter values across two sessions. Using a one-way ANOVA on each matrix, with random participant effects, we split the total variance of each network property into between-participant (<italic>MS<sub>b</sub></italic>) and within-participant (<italic>MS<sub>w</sub></italic>) variance. Then, the <italic>ICC</italic> values were calculated according to the following equation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Shrout1">[40]</xref>:<disp-formula id="pone.0072425.e005"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0072425.e005" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>k</italic> is the number of repeated observations per participant, <italic>MS<sub>b</sub></italic> is the between-participant variance and <italic>MS<sub>w</sub></italic> is the within-participant variance. All reliability indices discussed above were evaluated according to the criteria proposed by Sampat and Winer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Sampat1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Winer1">[42]</xref>, where an <italic>ICC</italic> value from 0 to 0.25 indicates poor reliability; 0.25 to 0.4 low reliability; 0.4 to 0.6 fair reliability; 0.6 to 0.75 good reliability; and 0.75 to 1.0 excellent reliability. Notably, for one metric, if the within-participant variance is larger than the between-participant variance, it will lead to a negative <italic>ICC</italic>. Theoretically, such a situation is impossible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Rousson1">[43]</xref>, and the reasons for negative values is even currently unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Mller1">[44]</xref>. Thus, the negative <italic>ICC</italic> will be set to zero (not reliable), as generally suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Zhang1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Kong1">[45]</xref>. Because we constructed the network over a continuous sparsity threshold range, the <italic>ICC</italic> value is a function of the threshold. To further conduct a threshold-independent reliability assessment, we also calculated the integral or area under the curve (AUC) of each network metric <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-He4">[46]</xref> to be used as the corresponding <italic>ICC</italic> scalar of network evaluation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072425-g002">Figure 2</xref> displays a flowchart of the reliability analysis of the R-fNIRS brain network.</p>

<title>Denoising using independent component analysis</title>
<p>A general problem with R-fNIRS recordings is that the acquired signals often include various different types of signal noise and artifacts (e.g., instrumental noise, motion-induced artifacts and physiological noises). Independent component analysis (ICA) provides an important technique to reduce the effects of these noise sources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Zhang2">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Stone1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Kohno1">[48]</xref>. In this study we re-analyzed our R-fNIRS data and assessed the TRT reliability of functional brain networks after denoising based on a temporal ICA analysis. The analysis procedure we used was similar to that in previous R-fNIRS studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Zhang1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Zhang2">[25]</xref> and was performed here by using a publicly available software, <italic>FastICA v2.5</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cis.hut.fi/projects/ica/fastica/" xlink:type="simple">www.cis.hut.fi/projects/ica/fastica/</ext-link>). Specifically, the parameter settings of the <italic>FastICA</italic> algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Hyvarinen1">[49]</xref> included: number of iteration steps  = 10000, step length  = 0.00001, approach  = “deflation”, initial value  = “random”, nonlinearity  =  “skew”, fine-tune  =  “on”, and stabilization  =  “on”. The ICA analysis was separately performed on the raw data of HbO, HbR and HbT with the following procedures: extracting steady hemoglobin concentration signals (e.g. removing the initial time points from total data length), reducing the dimensionality of the data with principal component analysis (PCA), performing ICA analysis on the reduced dimensional data, identifying noise components, removing noise from the measured data, and calculating “real” neural activity signals. <italic>FastICA</italic> can automatically adjust the results of the analysis required to compensate for these preprocessing steps. The number of retained principal components (PCs) was determined according to the minimum number of PCs that retained more than 99% of data variance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-vandeVen1">[50]</xref>. Meanwhile, the number of independent components through ICA decomposition was set to be equal to the number of PCs. After ICA analysis, the components related to noise and artifacts were identified from three aspects: temporal profiles, spatial maps and power spectra. A component would be considered noise if it met one of the following conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Zhang2">[25]</xref>: <italic>i</italic>) the corresponding temporal profile included sudden jumps, slowly-varied U or inverted U-shaped spike, or numerous inter-current quick spikes; <italic>ii</italic>) the dominant frequency of power spectra of the component was outside the range of 0.01∼0.1Hz; <italic>iii</italic>) the spatial map of the component presented a global and spatially dispersive pattern. Notably, the map could be approximately related to the interference in superficial layers of head <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Kohno1">[48]</xref>. After identifying these types of noise components, each concentration signal of HbO, HbR, and HbT was reconstructed with a particular component eliminated from the original R-fNIRS time course by replacing zero in the corresponding column of mixing matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Kohno1">[48]</xref>. Finally, we reconstructed the brain networks and then computed their topological properties and the <italic>ICCs</italic> as described above.</p>

<title>TRT reliability of RSFC maps</title>
<p>The group-level RSFC maps of two R-fNIRS scans (session 1 and session 2) and the linear relationship between them are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072425-g003">Fig. 3A–C</xref>. In general, the spatial patterns of the RSFC maps exhibited high similarity between sessions across HbO, HbR, and HbT, and this can be observed in both the qualitative visual inspection and quantitative correlation analysis (HbO: <italic>r</italic> = 0.93, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001; HbR: <italic>r</italic> = 0.89, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001; HbT: <italic>r</italic> = 0.92, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001). The individual RSFC correlation between sessions was also examined independently, and these results are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0072425-t001">Table 1</xref>. The RSFC maps between sessions also manifested high similarities (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) for each participant and each hemoglobin concentration signal; the average correlation coefficients across subjects were 0.70±0.09 (mean and standard deviation) for HbO, 0.67±0.13 for HbR, and 0.69±0.10 for HbT.</p>

<p>Additionally, the AUC was calculated to test for significant differences in each metric across subjects between sessions. The results indicated that almost all parameters (except <italic>β</italic> in HbR) were not significantly different (paired t-tests, <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0072425-t002">Table 2</xref>), suggesting a high similarity across global network measures between sessions at the individual level. The AUC of each metric was also employed to calculate the reliability measure. The results of the reliability analyses are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072425-g006">Fig. 6A–C</xref> for HbO, HbR, and HbT, respectively. For both HbO and HbR signals, almost all network metrics consistently exhibited fair to excellent reliability (except <italic>β</italic> in HbO and <italic>r</italic> in HbR showing poor and low reliability, respectively). In contrast, four of ten metrics showed fair to excellent reliability for HbT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072425-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). Numerically, the <italic>ICC</italic> values for HbR were the highest (<italic>ICC</italic> = 0.60, averaged across all metrics), followed by HbO (mean <italic>ICC</italic> = 0.55); HbT had the lowest relative <italic>ICC</italic> values (mean <italic>ICC</italic> = 0.36). Further statistical analysis using a one-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed that the reliability of all network metrics from the three different hemoglobin concentration signals exhibited significant differences [F(2, 9)  = 5.20; <italic>p</italic> = 0.017] and that HbR generally displayed the best relative reliability (paired t-tests, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03). Viewed from a single network metric, the clustering coefficient <italic>C<sub>p</sub></italic> and global efficiency measure <italic>E<sub>glob</sub></italic> displayed relatively better reliability, with an average reliability level of excellent (<italic>ICC</italic> &gt; 0.7) across the HbO, HbR, and HbT signals.</p>

<title>TRT reliability of nodal metrics</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072425-g007">Figure 7</xref> shows the nodal reliability of the degree, efficiency and betweenness measures as a function of the sparsity threshold values. Similar to global network metrics, the reliability of the nodal metrics also changes with sparsity and varies between metrics. Visually, betweenness exhibited the worst reliability across the range of thresholds, while the reliabilities of degree and efficiency were higher and comparable to one another for the HbO, HbR, and HbT signals. Furthermore, nodal reliability was estimated based on a threshold-independent metric, the AUC of each nodal metric. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072425-g008">Figure 8</xref> shows the reliability distribution of the total 46 nodes on one brain image.

<title>TRT reliability of network metrics after denoising using ICA</title>

In general, we found that the main results remained few changes as compared to those without ICA analysis. For example, the <italic>ICC</italic> values of RSFC maps with ICA denosing were 0.63±0.20 for HbO, 0.68±0.20 for HbR, and 0.71±0.21 for HbT, which was highly compatible with the results without ICA analysis (HbO: 0.70±0.15; HbR: 0.65±0.19; HbT: 0.71±0.17) (Figs. S1–S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0072425.s001">Supporting Information S1</xref>). Meanwhile, at the individual level, the RSFC maps still remain a high correlation between two sessions after denoising using ICA (Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0072425.s001">Supporting Information S1</xref>). For global and nodal network metrics, the reliability was threshold-sensitive and varied among both network metrics and hemoglobin concentration signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072425-g010">Figs. 10</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072425-g011">11</xref> and Figs.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previously, we showed that R-fNIRS can be used in combination with graph theory methodology to reveal topological properties of human functional brain networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Niu1">[12]</xref>. In the current study, we further addressed the TRT reliability of these topological properties. A comprehensive assessment of network reliability was carried out on three sets of network measures (RSFC, global network metrics and regional nodal metrics). These network metrics were calculated based on two sets of noise-reduction data using frequency-based and ICA-based denoising approaches, respectively, and the results consistently demonstrated that the R-fNIRS brain networks possessed good reliability on RSFC and fair to excellent reliability on most global and nodal network metrics.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>TRT reliability of RSFC maps</title>
<p>Based on a correlational analysis and a reliability assessment, we demonstrated that the fNIRS-based RSFC maps have high similarity (Pearson correlation: <italic>r</italic> = 0.91±0.03, averaged across three concentration signals) and high reliability (<italic>ICC</italic> = 0.69±0.03, averaged across three concentration signals) across sessions. Our results are compatible with the findings of previous RSFC reliability studies based on resting-state fMRI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Shehzad1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Wang2">[52]</xref> and R-fNIRS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Zhang1">[24]</xref> data. For example, Shehzad and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Shehzad1">[51]</xref> found that the fMRI-derived RSFC maps showed remarkable spatial consistency and modest to good reliability across different scanning sessions for both region-of-interest and voxel-wise analyses. The high reliability of RSFC maps were also further confirmed by Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Wang2">[52]</xref> at a whole-brain level. Using R-fNIRS data, Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Zhang1">[24]</xref> demonstrated that the RSFC of the sensorimotor regions was TRT reliable at both individual and group levels within and between sessions. In the present study we showed the high reliability of whole-brain RSFC maps based on the R-fNIRS data. Collectively, these accumulated evidences demonstrated that the measure of RSFC is reliable and trustworthy to measure the brain's intrinsic functional architecture regardless of the imaging techniques of fNIRS and fMRI. Additionally, we found positive correlation between RSFC reliability and connectivity strength for HbO and/or HbR. This finding suggests that the reliability of functional connectivity for these two concentration signals is partly determined by their connection strength.</p>

<title>TRT reliability of global network metrics</title>
<p>In recent years, TRT reliability of global network metrics has been examined using different imaging modalities, including MEG and fMRI techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Wang2">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Braun1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Deuker1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Liang1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Telesford1">[56]</xref>. These research findings provide solid foundation for potential applied studies on longitudinal changes, measurements of normal development, or drug treatment-related effects. In the present study, we investigated the TRT reliability of global metrics of R-fNIRS brain networks from two perspectives. First, we examined the effect of varying threshold values on network reliability and found that the reliability of all global metrics is related to those selected threshold values. The threshold-sensitive characteristics of global network metrics are considered as typical concerns in brain network study, and have also been demonstrated in previous fMRI studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Wang2">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Braun1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Deuker1">[54]</xref>. For example, Wang and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Wang2">[52]</xref> pointed out that the reliability of global network metrics varied from poor to excellent grades which depended on the selected threshold values. These observations suggest that it is extremely important to select an appropriate threshold for obtaining reliable results in the study of brain networks. However, it needs to notice that there is currently no accepted standard in the literature for determining the suitable threshold values applied to different network studies. Generally, a compromise method is to investigate the network over a continuous threshold range from the sparsest connection to the densest connection.</p>
<p>Second, we examined the TRT reliability of global network metrics by excluding the impact of thresholds and found that most global network metrics exhibited overall high TRT reliability. Of note, our observation is consistent with a previous report from Telesford et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Telesford1">[56]</xref>, who demonstrated the TRT reliability of graph metrics of functional human brain network based on a set of BOLD-fMRI data and also investigated an overall high TRT reliability on some global network metrics such as the clustering coefficient <italic>C<sub>p</sub></italic>, path length <italic>L<sub>p</sub></italic>, and global efficiency <italic>E<sub>glob</sub></italic>. However, it is worth noting that these findings are inconsistent with those shown in two previous BOLD-fMRI studies demonstrating low <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Wang2">[52]</xref> and modest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Braun1">[53]</xref> TRT reliability for the global network metrics, respectively. For example, Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Wang2">[52]</xref> found that most of the global network metrics displayed overall low TRT reliability, especially for the clustering coefficient <italic>C<sub>p</sub></italic> that uniformly showed poor reliability (<italic>ICC</italic>&lt;0.25) regardless of which type of network (binarized or weighted) adopted for that study. By contrast, Braun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Braun1">[53]</xref> found that the reliability of global network metrics was moderate (0.41&lt; <italic>ICC</italic> &lt;0.59) but highly depended on the processing strategies such as the selection of frequency-band range and the use of global signal regression. For the discrepancies among these studies, we speculate that it could be attributable to the different imaging modalities, scanning intervals, network size, population size, and the node and edge definitions applied in these studies. Moreover, the resting-state imaging data captures the information of complex integration among various brain regions, and the integration always exhibits a dynamic, time-varying fashion on the order of second or minute <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Chu1">[57]</xref>. In the future, it would be interesting to compare TRT reliability of graphic metrics of brain functional networks derived from the technique of simultaneous acquisition of different modalities (e.g., fNIRS vs. BOLD-fMRI)<bold>.</bold> In addition, it is worth noting that there also exist several global network metrics exhibiting low reliability across different fNIRS signals (i.e., HbO, HbR, and HbT), such as the characteristic path length <italic>Lp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072425-g010">Fig.10C</xref>), hierarchy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072425-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>), assorsitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072425-g010">Fig. 10A</xref>), and modularity parameter <italic>Q</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072425-g010">Fig.10C</xref>).The possible reasons for the low reliability global-metrics could be 1) that these network metrics depend on the fine structure of observed networks, while the fine structure could be sensitive to the subtle fluctuations of functional connections between two sessions; 2) that these network metrics characterizing aspects of intrinsic brain function that can be less robustly estimated using fNIRS signal(s) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Braun1">[53]</xref>; 3) that these network metrics manifested a low between-subject variance in differentiating subjects or a high within-subject variance across scanning sessions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Wang2">[52]</xref>. Moreover, we also found that the normalized metrics of normalized clustering coefficient <italic>γ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072425-g006">Figs. 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072425-g010">10C</xref>), normalized characteristic path length <italic>λ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072425-g006">Figs. 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072425-g010">10C</xref>) and small-world scale σ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072425-g006">Figs. 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072425-g010">10B, and 10C</xref>) also exhibited low reliability across HbO, HbR and/or HbT signals. We speculated that the low reliability of these three network metrics might be related to the randomization approaches which were used to generate the matched random networks. To examine this point, we recalculated these three global metrics (normalized clustering coefficient, normalized characteristic path length, and small-worldness) using the correlation matrix randomization method that preserves the transitive network structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Zalesky1">[58]</xref>. Likewise, the reliability level of these three metrics was also quantified by <italic>ICC</italic>. We found that the reliability of these three metrics was largely improved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072425-g012">Fig. 12</xref>) as compared to the results obtained from that topology randomization method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072425-g006">Fig. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072425-g010">Fig. 10</xref>). The improvement of reliability could be attributable to decreased within-subject variance due to the conservative estimation of global metrics induced by the correlation matrix randomization algorithm. This observation also suggested that it would be important to choose appropriate randomization methods for achieving reliable results of brain network analysis.</p>

<title>TRT reliability of nodal metrics</title>
<p>Similar to the findings in global network measures, we also observed that nodal reliability was threshold-sensitive for local nodal metrics. This finding further highlights the importance of threshold selection for achieving reliable results. Additionally, regarding to the reliability assessment of nodal centrality metrics, a previous fMRI study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Wang2">[52]</xref> has made a systematic investigation on 6 nodal metrics (including the nodal degree, efficiency, betweenness, cluster coefficient, participant coefficient, and normalized participant coefficient), and found that the nodal degree had the highest TRT reliability. In the current study, we found that in addition to the nodal degree, the nodal efficiency also exhibited fairly high reliability, and both were significantly higher than that reliability of betweenness regardless of the HbO, HbR or HbT signals. More importantly, the reliability of both nodal degree and nodal efficiency exhibited no significant differences across the different hemoglobin concentration signals, suggesting that both these metrics are robust to different hemodynamic contrasts. Similarly, in the previous BOLD-fMRI study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Wang2">[52]</xref>, the authors also found that the reliability of nodal network properties was minimally affected by many factors such as scanning time interval, network membership (networks excluding or including negative correlations) and network type (binarized or weighted networks). These findings indicated that the reliability of nodal properties (e.g., nodal degree and efficiency) was more robust and least affected, as compared to that of global network metrics. However, we also noticed that among the nodal centrality metrics, the nodal betweenness was the most sensitive to spatial nodal configuration and most unreliable across different concentration contrasts, which indicated that the nodal betweenness metric should be used with caution if no additional effort was made to improve its reliability. This observation from fNIRS data was also proved to be consistent with the previous BOLD-fMRI results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Wang2">[52]</xref>.</p>

<title>Comparisons of graph metric reliability among the three hemoglobin concentrations</title>
<p>In the current study, we found that the three hemoglobin concentrations (HbO, HbR, and HbT) exhibited different reliability profiles for graph-based network metrics: the HbR showed the best global reliability (mean <italic>ICC</italic> = 0.604), while the HbT showed the worst reliability (<italic>ICC</italic>&lt;0.4 for most global metrics). In our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Niu1">[12]</xref>, we also demonstrated that although all the three types of concentration signals can be used to characterize topological organization of intrinsic functional brain architecture, the quantitative network parameters differed significantly. The discrepancies among different concentration signals results may be attributable to their different nature in hemodynamic responses to transient neural activity and/or the difference in signal-to-noise ratio in the R-fNIRS measurements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-White2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Gagnon1">[59]</xref>. While all of these three hemoglobin concentration signals are computed from the same raw R-fNIRS data, each signal reflects different hemodynamic response during neuronal activity. Under normal circumstances, the HbO signal reflects regional cerebral blood flow changes and the HbT signal reflects regional cerebral blood volume changes within the imaging field. HbR is generated through oxygen utilization in cerebral tissue. During fNIRS measurement, the signals recording the regional changes in cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume were generally aliased into various systemic physiological noises. The noise components were further propagated into different concentration signals during the calculation of hemoglobin concentration. It has been demonstrated that the HbR signal was generally minimally aliased into various noise components compared to the signals of HbO and HbT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Kirilina1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Strangman1">[61]</xref>, which, therefore, could bring about higher reliability for HbR signal. By contrast, both the HbO and HbT signals were more affected by changes in physiological conditions such as heart rate, blood pressure, blood flow, and breathing cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Kohno1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Kirilina1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Boas1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Toronov1">[63]</xref>, which, to some extent, could reduce the reliability of the resultant network metrics.</p>
<p>In spite of the overall low reliability of global network metrics for HbT signal, we also noticed that several global metrics (e.g., hierarchy <italic>β</italic> and assortativity <italic>r</italic>) displayed fairly good reliability whereas they showed relatively lower reliability for the HbO and/or HbR signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072425-g006">Fig. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072425-g010">Fig. 10</xref>). This implies that the TRT reliability of some network metrics is specific to a certain concentration signal. Consequently, these findings highlight that fNIRS researchers should choose the optimum hemoglobin concentration contrast with caution for achieving reliable network investigation. Beyond the specificity of the high reliability of network properties on hemoglobin concentration, we also found that several network parameters (e.g., clustering coefficient <italic>C<sub>p</sub></italic> and global efficiency measure <italic>E<sub>glob</sub></italic>) exhibited excellent reliability on average across the three concentration signals. This suggests that <italic>C<sub>p</sub></italic> and <italic>E<sub>glob</sub></italic> could be utilized as two reliable biomarkers of functional brain architecture. In addition to these global metrics, we also found two nodal metrics: nodal degree and efficiency, which had mean <italic>ICC</italic> values across three concentration signals larger than 0.65, displayed not only the best reliability among all network measures but also the most robust performance among all network measures but also the most robust performance among the different hemoglobin concentration signals. These reliable and robust features suggest these metrics as reliable candidates to reveal the topological organization of intrinsic functional networks in future fNIRS studies in the human brain.</p>

<title>Noise reduction in R-fNIRS data analysis</title>
<p>A common problem in R-fNIRS studies is that the spontaneous low-frequency fluctuations are contaminated by various different types of noise and artifacts such as instrumental noise, motion-induced artifacts, and physiological interferences which often occurs in the superficial layers of the head and in the brain tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Boas1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Diamond1">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Obrig1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Payne1">[66]</xref>. These noises could have different sources and possess various frequency distributions of spectra. A general way to reduce the effect of these kinds of noise is the utilization of a band-pass filter with cut-off frequency from 0.009 to 0.08 Hz that represents the frequency range of hemodynamic signals thought to emanate from spontaneous neural activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-White2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Biswal1">[27]</xref>. Using such a noise-reduction strategy, several R-fNIRS studies have explored intrinsic RSFC patterns in multiple brain networks involved in the sensorimotor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Lu1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-White2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Zhang2">[25]</xref>, auditory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Lu1">[20]</xref>, visual <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-White2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Zhang2">[25]</xref>, and language systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Zhang3">[67]</xref> as well as the whole-brain functional network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Homae1">[19]</xref>. The results from these studies are proved to be compatible with each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Lu1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-White2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Zhang2">[25]</xref> and with previous fMRI investigations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Biswal1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Greicius1">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Lowe1">[69]</xref>. It suggests that the low-frequency spontaneous fluctuations measured in R-fNIRS signals may reflect spontaneous brain activity in spite of various confounding origins (e.g., systematic interferences in the superficial layers from skin and the scalp of the head). Nonetheless, the superficial interferences have been considered an important noise source in R-fNIRS data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Cooper1">[70]</xref>. Recently, several denoising methods have been proposed for separating the noise from neuronal signals, which includes short separation measurement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Gagnon2">[71]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Saager1">[72]</xref>, independent component analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Kohno1">[48]</xref>, and adaptive filter method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Zhang4">[73]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Zhang5">[74]</xref>. These methods are playing crucial roles in reducing the noise effects on the signals of spontaneous neural activity. Among them, both the short-distance measurement and the adaptive filter methods have a common experimental consideration that they need a design of additional short channels to record the superficial signal. However, a recent study has pointed out that the location of short separation measurement strongly impacts the performance of noise reduction in fNIRS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Gagnon3">[75]</xref>. Thus, it would be important and necessary to consider the number and the location of short-separation channels while adopting these two methods. In contrast, the ICA is a pure data-driven approach and does not require specific considerations of experimental design. Due to the capability of blind source separation, ICA can separate various noise and artifacts from measurement data, which have been widely used in both task-based and resting-state fMRI studies. In this study, we used the ICA approach for denoising and found that the reliability of many network metrics was not improved after the denoising processing. One reason could be attributable to the intrinsic instability of these network metrics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Braun1">[53]</xref>, as estimated using fNIRS signal(s). Meantime, the characteristic of blind source separation of ICA makes the separated source components lack of explicit physiological explanation, which could lead to the difficulties of completely identifying and removing the noise components from the measured signals. Therefore, future studies are needed to test whether TRT reliability of brain functional networks could be improved by utilizing recording respiration and heart rates while collecting R-fNIRS data or other noise-reduction approaches (e.g., short-separation measurement).</p>

<title>Further considerations</title>
<p>Several issues and limitations of the present study should be further addressed. First, the present study focused mainly on the evaluation of short-term reliability of R-fNIRS brain network metrics. Of note, one previous BOLD-fMRI study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Wang2">[52]</xref> found that the scanning interval had an influence on the network reliability and that long-term scans provided a higher TRT reliability than short-term scans on some network metrics such as normalized characteristic path length <italic>λ</italic>. Therefore, it would be our interests to examine the long-term TRT reliability in future fNIRS brain network studies. Second, several potential factors may affect the assessment of reliability of R-fNIRS brain networks but have not been elucidated in the present study, which includes: variation in fNIRS measurement environment (e.g., natural light and dark conditions) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Leff1">[76]</xref>, variation in probe configuration across different imaging systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Niu2">[77]</xref>, variation in probe placement across participants and across scanning sessions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Hoshi1">[78]</xref>, and potential change in participants' mental states during resting-state scanning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Shehzad1">[51]</xref>. In the future, the effects of these factors need to be systematically and comprehensively investigated. Third, we limited our examination of TRT reliability to widely used network metrics (10 global and 3 nodal characteristics). However, there are other network metrics, such as synchronization and vulnerability, whose TRT reliability should be evaluated in the future. Finally, there are different preprocessing strategies in fNIRS data analysis. Previous BOLD-fMRI studies have demonstrated that several factors (e.g., global signal removal, frequency bands and correlation metrics) might affect the network reliability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Wang2">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072425-Liang1">[55]</xref>. Future studies will be required to investigate the influence of different preprocessing techniques on network reliability within the context of R-fNIRS.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We comprehensively evaluated the TRT reliability of graph metrics of R-fNIRS brain networks. Our results demonstrate that the R-fNIRS brain networks show good TRT reliability on RSFC and fair to excellent reliability on most global metrics and two nodal network metrics (nodal degree and efficiency). These findings suggest that the topological metrics with high reliability in R-fNIRS brain networks are potential to be employed in future studies of developmental and clinical neuroscience. Future research should also focus on the investigation and improvement of those network metrics that display low reliability.</p>
