Further investigation confirmed that miR-499 could promote neonatal rat cardiomyocyte proliferation. MiR-499 knock-down enhanced apoptosis in the late differentiation stage in P19CL6 cells, but overexpression of miR-499 resulted in a decrease in the apoptosis rate. Sox6 was identified as a direct target of miR-499 and its expression was detected from day 8 or day 10 of cardiac differentiation of P19CL6 cells. Sox6 played a role in cell viability, inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis in P19CL6 cells and cardiomyocytes. The overexpression of Sox6 could reverse the proliferation and anti-apoptosis effects of miR-499. It was also found that miR-499 might exert its function by regulating cyclin D1 via its influence on Sox6.</p>

			<title>Introduction</title>
			<p>Heart morphogenesis and development is a complicated process, in which cell cycle progression/exit control is of paramount importance. During the embryonic and fetal stages, cardiomyocytes rapidly proliferate so that a sufficient number of cells are produced to form the myocardium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Before birth, proliferation ceases and cardiomyocytes throughout the myocardium undergo a hyperplastic to hypertrophic transition in which the predominant form of growth is an increase in cell size and myofibril density rather than cell number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. After birth, usually in the first two weeks of life in mice, neonatal cardiomyocytes complete terminal differentiation and the cell cycle is permanently arrested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This phenomenon is common, but details of the mechanisms are currently not very clear.</p>
			<p>Growing evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs), which are endogenous regulatory RNAs, play important roles in heart development and heart pathogenesis. miR-499 is an miRNA that is abundantly found in cardiac cells and is essentially undetectable in human cardiac stem cells (hCSCs) or human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), but is expressed in differentiated or post-mitotic cardiomyocytes and continues to be expressed in fetal, neonatal, and adult cardiomyocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, the biological functions of miR-499 in differentiated cardiomyocytes or in cardiomyocyte differentiation is not very clear.</p>
			<p>It is believed that one of the targets of miR-499 is Sox6, which is a member of the Sox transcription factor family and has been detected in a number of tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. There is evidence for the functionally diverse role of Sox6 in various cell types: it is involved in cartilage cell fate commitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], normal positioning and maturation of the cortical interneurons derived from medial ganglionic eminences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and erythroblast proliferation and normal erythrocyte maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Sox6 is expressed in normal human and mouse heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]: in <italic>p</italic><sup>100H</sup> mutant mice that lack a functional Sox6 gene, half of the homozygotes died within 24 h after birth and the remaining homozygotes that survived died within 2 weeks, which is believed to be caused by the disruption of the Sox6 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In P19CL6 cells, an <italic>in vitro</italic> cardiomyocyte differentiation system, Sox6 expression was not detectable in the early stage of differentiation (before day 6); the highest expression was observed on day 11 and was associated with the initiation of cardiomyocyte beating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This suggests that Sox6 is not involved in the fate commitment of cardiomyocytes (early stage of differentiation) but is associated with late-stage cardiomyocyte differentiation (terminal differentiation). However, details of the role of Sox6 in the process of heart development or cardiomyocyte differentiation are unclear.</p>
			<p>Mouse Sox6-3’UTR has seven miR-499 target sites, three of which are conserved in its human, mouse, rat, dog and chicken counterparts. Numerous studies have demonstrated that miR-499 could target Sox6 via Sox6-3’UTR luciferase reporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. During skeletal muscle atrophy, increased expression of Sox6 was associated with down-regulation of miR-499 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]; in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, Sox6 mRNA expression was significantly reduced after miR-499 overexpression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. How the association between miR-499 and Sox6 is related with the differentiation process of cardiomyocytes needs to be elucidated.</p>
			<p>In this study, we investigated the impact of miR-499 and Sox6 during the differentiation process of cardiomyocytes by using the well-established <italic>in vitro</italic> cardiomyocyte differentiation system, P19CL6 cells. We found that Sox6 and miR-499 are highly expressed during cardiomyocyte terminal differentiation. By gain- and loss-of-function methods, including stable overexpression of miR-499 and Sox6 and transient down-regulation of miR-499 and Sox6, we demonstrate that Sox6, as a repressor of cyclin D1, arrests cardiomyocyte proliferation and facilitates cell cycle exit; miR-499 on the other hand downregulates the expression of its target protein, Sox6, to an appropriate level so as to prevent cardiomyocyte apoptosis.</p>

				<p>Mouse P19CL6 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], a cell line derived from P19 embryonal carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], were kindly provided by Prof. Yunzeng. Zou, Fu Dan University, China. These cells can efficiently differentiate into beating cardiomyocytes with adherent conditions when exposed to 1% DMSO and thus P19CL6 is considered a useful <italic>in vitro</italic> model to study cardiomyocyte differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The cells were cultured as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In brief, the cells were grown in a 60-mm tissue culture dish with growth medium containing α-minimal essential medium (Gibco BRL) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone USA), penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 mg/ml), and were maintained in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere at 37°C. To induce cardiac differentiation, P19CL6 cells were plated at a density of 3.7 × 10<sup>5</sup> in a 60-mm tissue culture dish with the growth medium containing 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The medium was changed every 2 days. The days of differentiation were numbered consecutively beginning after the first day of the DMSO treatment (day 0).</p>
				<p>Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were prepared from 1- to 2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats. Briefly, the rats were anesthetized with 5 mg/100 g body weight of sodium pentobarbital and heart organ was removed by classic surgery procedures. The ventricles were minced with scissors and digested at 37 <sup>o</sup>C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% trypsin (Gibco BRL) and 0.05% type I collagenase (Gibco BRL). After 8-10 cycles of digestion for 8 min each, the cells were collected by low speed centrifugation and suspended in DMED (Gibco BRL) with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco BRL). The resulting cell suspension, a mixture of myocytes and non-myocytes (mostly fibroblasts), was incubated in a tissue culture flask for 1.5 h for non-myocytes to adhere to the flask. The remaining unattached myocytes were appropriately diluted and plated in 60 mm dished (5×10<sup>5</sup> cells/well). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco BRL) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum for 36 h before the transfection.</p>

				<title>MiR-499 was highly expressed in the late stage of cardiac differentiation in P19CL6 cells</title>
				<p>When P19CL6 cells were treated with 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 12 days, over 95% of the cells expressed sarcomeric α-actinin, a marker for mature cardiomyocytes, and rhythmic spontaneous beating started (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074504-g001">Figure <bold>1A</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0074504.s005">Video <bold>S1</bold></xref>). Cardiac-specific transcription factors GATA4 and Nkx2.5 were detected at day 4, an early stage of differentiation. Cardiac contractile proteins β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC) and α-MHC were expressed at day 8 or day 10, the late stage of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074504-g001">Figure <bold>1B</bold></xref>). To examine the temporal expression profile of miR-499 during cardiomyocyte differentiation, qRT-PCR for miR-499 was performed. The expression of miR-499 was almost undetectable at day 0 and day 6, but increased gradually from day 8, indicating that miR-499 might have some biological function in the late stage of cardiac differentiation of P19CL6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074504-g001">Figure <bold>1C</bold></xref>).</p>

				<title>MiR-499 promoted the proliferation of P19CL6 cells and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes</title>
				<p>Given that miR-499 might participate in the cardiac differentiation of P19CL6 cells, we established a cell line that stably overexpressed miR-499 (P19CL6-miR-499, hereafter referred to as P-499) in order to observe the impact of persistent miR-499 expression on cardiac differentiation. P19CL6 cells stably transfected with pcDNA3.1 (P19CL6-pcDNA3.1, hereafter referred to as P-c3.1) was used as a negative control cell line. At the early differentiation stage, from day 0 to day 6, cell proliferation was similar among all three cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0074504.s001">Figure <bold>S1A</bold></xref><bold>, a, b, c</bold>). However, at the late differentiation stage, distinctive hyperplastic growth was observed in P-499 cells compared with P-c3.1 and P19CL6 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0074504.s001">Figure <bold>S1A, e, f, g</bold></xref>). As the cells formed a multilayer in the late differentiation stage, it was difficult to quantify the exact proliferation rate. To confirm this phenomenon observed in multilayer cell cultures, we employed the replating strategy. Using this method, the multilayer cells in the late differentiation stage could be observed in monolayer conditions. We replated the cells as a monolayer at the same density on day 10 of differentiation. After another 48 h of culture, the state of cell growth was observed under a microscope and the results confirmed our observations in multilayer cell cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0074504.s001">Figure <bold>S1B</bold></xref><bold>, a, b, c</bold>).</p>
				<p>Cell viability was analyzed using the CCK-8 assay at 0, 24 and 48 h after replating. The CCK-8 assay results showed that the cell viability of P-499 cells was 2.14- (24 h) and 3.04-fold (48 h) of that of P-c3.1 cells and P19CL6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074504-g002">Figure <bold>2A</bold></xref>), as also evidenced by the overgrowth observed under a microscope.

				<p>To understand the distinct proliferation phenotype of P-499 cells, we performed cell cycle profile analysis and EdU incorporation assay. The flow cytometry analysis indicated that miR-499 had significant effects on cell proliferation in the late stage of differentiation but not in the early stage. Similar percentages of cells in the G1 or S and G2 phases were observed at day 2 and day 6 in all three cell lines. However, by day 8 and day 10, the cell cycle progressed differently. In P19CL6 and P-c3.1 cells, the percentage of cells in the G1 phase increased from 72.27% and 74.30% respectively at day 8, to 76.76% and 77.31% respectively at day 10, indicating that the cells had almost stopped proliferating and might have started undergoing terminal differentiation; on the other hand, in P-499 cells, the percentage of cells in the G1 phase on day 8 (63.09%) and day 10 (61.5%) were at the same level as on day 6, which suggests that overexpression of miR-499 may maintain cell proliferation and thus inhibit terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074504-g002">Figure <bold>2B</bold></xref>, <bold>S2A</bold>).</p>
				<p>Consistent with the cell cycle analysis, the results of EdU incorporation were not significantly different among P19CL6, P-c3.1 and P-499 cells at the early stage of cardiac differentiation (day 2 and day 6): cells from all three cell lines possessed high proliferation capacity. However, at the late stage of cardiac differentiation, the incorporation of EdU gradually decreased in P19CL6 and P-c3.1 cells, but it was higher at day 8 and day 10 in P-499 cells (43.47% vs. 14.38% [P19CL6] and 12.21% [P-c3.1] on day 8; 42.85% vs. 6.32% [P19CL6] and 5.08% [P-c3.1] on day 10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074504-g002">Figure <bold>2C</bold></xref><bold>, S2B</bold>); therefore, DNA synthesis gradually ceased and P19CL6 and P-c3.1 cells exited the cell cycle, while P-499 cells showed continuous proliferation.</p>
				<p>To further confirm that miR-499 could promote cardiomyocyte proliferation during terminal differentiation, we tested whether miR-499 could promote proliferation of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. We selected 1- or 2-day-old neonatal rats for preparing ventricular myocytes, which are known to undergo terminal differentiation. The ventricular cardiomyocytes were transfected with pre-miR-499 or scrambled oligonucleotides. EdU incorporation assay showed that EdU incorporation was almost 1.5-fold of that in pre-miR-499-transfected cardiomyocytes compared with cells that were not transfected or those that were transfected with scrambled oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074504-g002">Figure <bold>2D, 2E</bold></xref>).</p>

				<title>MiR-499 knock-down enhanced apoptosis of cells in the late differentiation stage</title>
				<p>Using the annexin V-FITC binding assay, we found that miR-499 overexpression resulted in a decreased apoptosis rate in P-499 cells compared with P19CL6 and P-c3.1 cells from day 6 to day 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074504-g003">Figure <bold>3A</bold></xref><bold>, S2C</bold>). To investigate the effects of endogenous miR-499 knock-down, we replated P19CL6 cells and transfected them with cholesterol-modified anti-miR-499 (anti-499) oligonucleotides at day 12 of differentiation. The cells that were not transfected or transfected with scrambled oligonucleotides were used as negative controls. After transfection with anti-499 for 48 h, the cells became round and detached from the plate in some areas. In contrast, the control cells maintained their fibroblast-like shape and adhered to the plate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0074504.s001">Figure <bold>S1C</bold></xref>). Therefore, miR-499 knock-down increased the apoptosis rate of cells at the late differentiation stage.

				<title>MiR-499 targeted Sox6 at the late stage of cardiac differentiation</title>
				<p>Luciferase assay showed that addition of the pre-miR-499 duplex at a concentration of 50 nM resulted in decreased luciferase activity of the reporter that harbored Sox6-3’UTR (with the three highly conserved predicted miR-499-binding sites, Sox6-3’UTR-WT) in HeLa cells, but this was not observed with the reporter containing mutated miR-499-binding sites (Sox6-3’UTR-Mut) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074504-g004">Figure <bold>4A, 4B</bold></xref>). The inhibitory effect of miR-499 on Sox6 translation might also be observed in cardiac differentiation of P19CL6 cells. Therefore, we replated P19CL6 cells at day 8 of differentiation, for pre-miR-499 transfection. After 48 h of pre-miR-499 transfection, Western blotting analysis showed that the Sox6 protein level was reduced dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074504-g004">Figure <bold>4C</bold></xref>). Next, we tested whether knock-down of endogenous miR-499 could influence endogenous Sox6 expression. As the maximum level of miR-499 expression was observed on day 12 of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074504-g001">Figure <bold>1C</bold></xref>), P19CL6 cells were replated at day 12 of differentiation for anti-499 transfection.

				<p>Considering that P-Sox6 cells displayed decreased cell viability compared with the other cell lines, further investigation was carried out to explore whether Sox6 expression level is correlated with cell proliferation. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that compared to the P19CL6 and P-c3.1 cells, a greater proportion of P-Sox6 cells were in the G1 phase, especially at day 8 (83.82% vs. 72.27% [P19CL6] and 74.36% [P-c3.1]) and day 10 (91.76% vs. 76.76% [P19CL6] and 77.31% [P-c3.1]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074504-g005">Figure <bold>5B</bold></xref><bold>, S3A</bold>).

				<p>We also tested whether Sox6 could inhibit the proliferation of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes.

				<p>To confirm the influence of Sox6 on cyclin D1, we compared the expression of Sox6 and cyclin D1 at the same time point – day 9 of differentiation. The results showed that when Sox6 was overexpressed in P-Sox6 cells, cyclin D1 expression was inhibited, whereas when Sox6 expression was inhibited in P-499 cells, cyclin D1 expression was enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074504-g007">Figure <bold>7B</bold></xref>). While, if we overexpressed Sox6 in P-499 cells, the enhanced expression of Cyclin D1 was significantly reduced to normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074504-g007">Figure <bold>7C</bold></xref>). These results indicate that expression of cyclin D1 is indeed downregulated by Sox6. Thus, the action of Sox6 as a cyclin D1 inhibitor could promote the exit of cardiomyocytes from the cell cycle during the late stage of cardiomyocyte differentiation. In addition, the effects of anti-499 were further examined by Western blotting analysis: miR-499 knock-down resulted in increased Sox6 expression, thus reduced cyclin D1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074504-g007">Figure <bold>7D</bold></xref>).</p>
				<p>The 1,000-bp upstream region of the cyclin D1 promoter was cloned to create the pGL3-luciferase plasmid and was used with Sox6 overexpression plasmid to co-transfect P19CL6 cells on day 9. The results of the luciferase assay demonstrated that overexpression of Sox6 resulted in decreased luciferase activity of the cyclin D1 promoter. This indicates that Sox6 could negatively regulate transcription of the cyclin D1 gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074504-g007">Figure <bold>7E</bold></xref>).</p>

			<title>Discussion</title>
			<p>The main aim of our study was to determine the association between Sox6 and miR-499 and its role during the process of cardiomyocyte differentiation and maturation.</p>
			<p>As three highly conserved predicted miR-499-binding sites are reportedly present in Sox6-3’UTR and because of the known association between Sox6 and heart development, Sox6 is the most likely target gene of miR-499. This has been shown by luciferase reporter assays in various types of cell including 293T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], 3T3 fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], COS cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and HeLa cells (used in our study). Transgenic expression of miR-499 also effectively reduced the elevated Sox6 mRNA level in miR-208a<sup>-/-</sup> hearts and reduced the Sox6 mRNA level in skeletal muscles of MCK-miR-499 transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In addition, Sox6 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes after miR-499 transfection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In our experiments, not only did the endogenous Sox6 protein level decrease as a result of pre-miR-499 transfection, but also anti-499 transfection could upregulate the Sox6 protein level in P19CL6 cell-derived cardiomyocytes during the late stage of differentiation. This supports already available evidence that Sox6 is a target of miR-499.</p>
			<p>As miRNAs usually show pronounced spatial and temporal expression patterns, we analyzed the time course of miR-499 expression and the expression of its target gene Sox6 during cardiomyocyte differentiation in the P19CL6 <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation system. The early stage witnessed steady proliferation even as the cells began to differentiate; the expression of miR-499 and Sox6 was very low or undetectable at this stage. However, miR-499 and Sox6 were both highly expressed in the late stage, which is characterized by gradual decrease in proliferation. This indicates that the regulation of Sox6 by miR-499 is not only associated with cardiomyocyte differentiation but is also late stage-specific. In agreement with this, several studies have also reported that miR-499 is highly expressed in differentiated or post-mitotic cardiomyocytes but is almost absent or barely detectable in undifferentiated hCSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], human cardiomyocyte progenitor cells (hCMPCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and hESCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, how miR-499 is turned on in the cardiac differentiation system is still unclear.</p>
			<p>As a potential target of miR-499, the expression of Sox6 is also late stage-specific. This has been supported by some studies although there are some controversial reports. Sluijter et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] reported that Sox6 is expressed in proliferating hCMPCs. Hosoda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] reported that Sox6 mRNA expression was higher in the human myocardium than in hCSCs, while Sox6 proteins were barely detectable in human and rat myocytes but were apparent in both hCSCs and rat cardiac stem cells (rCSCs). In addition, in the P19CL6 <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation system, our data showed that both Sox6 mRNA and Sox6 protein were highly expressed in the late stage of differentiation, which is consistent with the results of Cohen-Barak’s study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p>
			<p>It has been reported that transgenic mice expressing a high level of miR-499 had larger hearts and displayed contractile dysfunction. Moreover, under cardiac pressure overload by thoracic aortic banding, the hearts of miR-499 transgenic mice demonstrated accentuated cardiac enlargement and severe contractile dysfunction, but the cardiomyocyte size was almost normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Sox6 has also been reported to play a significant role in cardiogenesis. The mouse with <italic>p</italic><sup>100H</sup> / <italic>p</italic><sup>100H</sup> mutant, a Sox6 null mutant, is characterized by early postnatal lethality, associated with progressive atrioventricular heart block and myopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p>
			<p>It should be noted that the endogenous miR-499 and Sox6 showed the opposite expression trend during the cardiac differentiation of P19CL6 cells. Furthermore, when we knockdown the endogenous miR-499, the expression of Sox6 was increased. Meanwhile, miR-499 knock-down in P19CL6 cells had similar effects to Sox6 overexpression. Sox6 overexpression inhibited cell proliferation, which means that it might be required for the terminal differentiation of cells; at the same time, overexpression of Sox6 resulted in increased cell apoptosis, which was also observed in the case of miR-499 knock-down. Considering the observation in Sox6 null <italic>p</italic><sup>100H</sup> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], we presume that down-regulation of Sox6 expression not only prevents cardiomyocytes from withdrawing from the cell cycle, but also prevents them from undergoing maturation. These results indicate that the appropriate expression of Sox6 could facilitate cell cycle exit in cardiomyocytes and promote cardiomyocyte maturation concurrently with terminal differentiation. Thus, a balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis is required, and miR-499 probably plays a role in this. This is supported by our finding that overexpression of Sox6 reversed the enhanced proliferation and anti-apoptotic effects of miR-499.</p>
			<p>Down-regulation of Cyclin D1 is required by cardiomyocytes for cell cycle exit and maturation during the late stage of differentiation. It has been reported that Sox6 inhibits cyclin D1 expression by interacting with β-catenin and HDAC1 in insulinoma INS-1E and NIH-3T3 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and that down-regulation of cyclin D1 is important for cell cycle exit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In the early stage of differentiation, cyclin D1 might be regulated by some other mechanisms, rather than Sox6 (data not shown); however, in the late stage, the downregulation of cyclin D1 is important for cell cycle exit. In our study too, in P-Sox6 cells, overexpression of Sox6 reduced the level of cyclin D1 and may have caused premature growth arrest. In P-499 cells, as Sox6 levels were markedly decreased by overexpression of miR-499, cyclin D1 was consequently maintained at a higher level than in P19CL6 cells, leading to continuous proliferation of differentiating cardiomyocytes during the late stage of differentiation. These results indicate that miR-499 may target cyclin D1 via Sox6.</p>
			<p>We have noticed some controversial reports on the function of miR-499. Two groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] have documented that miR-499 overexpression reduces proliferation and enhances differentiation of cardiac stem cells or cardiomyocyte progenitor cells; it increases the expression of cardiac troponin T, α-cardiac actinin, and MLC-2v or the expression of Nkx-2.5 and GATA4. In contrast, the data from our study showed that miR-499 overexpression has no remarkable effect on the expression of GATA4 and Nkx-2.5; moreover, the cell proliferation was significantly enhanced in P-499 cells. We think that the discrepancy in the findings is most probably related to differences in cell sources or types (mouse P19CL6 cells, human cardiac stem cells or human cardiomyocyte progenitor cells).</p>
			<p>In conclusion, our results provide evidence for Sox6 being a target of miR-499, and for the role of both Sox6 and miR-499 in neonatal heart development. There are also some indications that miR-499 may target cyclin D1 via Sox6.</p>
