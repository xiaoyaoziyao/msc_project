<abstract>
<p>Vitamin D and folate are activated and degraded by sunlight, respectively, and the physiological processes they control are likely to have been targets of selection as humans expanded from Africa into Eurasia. We investigated signals of positive selection in gene sets involved in the metabolism, regulation and action of these two vitamins in worldwide populations sequenced by Phase I of the 1000 Genomes Project. Comparing allele frequency-spectrum-based summary statistics between these gene sets and matched control genes, we observed a selection signal specific to East Asians for a gene set associated with vitamin D action in bones. The selection signal was mainly driven by three genes CXXC finger protein 1 (<italic>CXXC1</italic>), low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (<italic>LRP5</italic>) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (<italic>RUNX2</italic>). Examination of population differentiation and haplotypes allowed us to identify several candidate causal regulatory variants in each gene. Four of these candidate variants (one each in <italic>CXXC1</italic> and <italic>RUNX2</italic> and two in <italic>LRP5</italic>) had a &gt;70% derived allele frequency in East Asians, but were present at lower (20–60%) frequency in Europeans as well, suggesting that the adaptation might have been part of a common response to climatic and dietary changes as humans expanded out of Africa, with implications for their role in vitamin D-dependent bone mineralization and osteoporosis insurgence. We also observed haplotype sharing between East Asians, Finns and an extinct archaic human (Denisovan) sample at the <italic>CXXC1</italic> locus, which is best explained by incomplete lineage sorting.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fat-soluble vitamin D and water-soluble folate (folic acid, vitamin B9) are activated and degraded by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, respectively, and are necessary for human development and physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref003">3</xref>]. These processes are controlled by many genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146072.g001">Fig 1</xref>) that are thus likely to have been affected by the expansion of humans from tropical Africa into northern climes in the last 50–60,000 years, and may, therefore, have been targets of selection as humans adapted to new diets and environments. Seasonal variation in UV radiation at higher latitudes has been linked to natural selection in skin pigmentation of modern humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref003">3</xref>], and it has been suggested that lighter skin pigmentation was necessary to maintain homeostasis of vitamin D and protect against infections and skeletal deformities that are associated with reduced levels of this vitamin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref004">4</xref>]. Dietary intake of vitamin D is usually inadequate for normal physiological development and it is mainly produced in the skin by UV irradiation of 7- dehydrocholesterol. Its biologically active form (1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) acts as a hormone to regulate gene expression in several organs. It does so by binding the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which forms a heterodimer with retinoid X receptor (RXR), and recruits several other proteins to form the Vitamin D activation complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146072.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Vitamin D3 regulates target gene expression in many tissues and has major roles in diverse physiological functions, being primarily responsible for calcium and phosphate homeostasis and bone remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref001">1</xref>]. In contrast, folate is exclusively obtained from the diet and is required for nucleic acid synthesis and repair, and methylation of DNA, proteins and fats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref006">6</xref>].</p>

<title>Vitamin D and folate acquisition, metabolism and gene sets analyzed in this study.</title>
<p>The upper part shows metabolism of vitamin D (yellow arrows) and folate (black arrows). Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> can be obtained from the diet, but it is mainly synthesised in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) in response to light. It is then transported into the liver where it is hydroxylated to produce 25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> which is subsequently converted into its active form 1α, 25- dihydroxy vitamin D<sub>3</sub>. This is transported in blood by vitamin D binding protein (DBP) and binds vitamin D receptor (VDR). The lower part shows gene sets analyzed in this study. The circles are proportional to number of genes in each set. The numbers in blue or pink circles indicate number of genes in each set that were present in AmiGO using the search terms “Vitamin D” (blue) or “Folate” (pink). Additional vitamin D (Vit D or VD) and folate (FA) gene sets are shown in shades of yellow and grey, respectively. The vitamin D gene sets that were generated included vitamin D targets identified by ChIP-Seq (VDR targets), genes involved in vitamin D action in bones, kidneys and intestines and all proteins involved in the VDR activation complex, including those directly interacting with VDR (VDRIP) and RXR (RXRIP) receptors. Folate gene sets include enzymes and receptors involved in dietary folate uptake and transport (FAU), proteins involved in nucleic acid synthesis (NAS) and methylation. The latter were sub-divided into genes involved in metabolism of methionine (Met), homocysteine (HCV) and S-adenosyl methionine methylation (SAM). The small blue and pink circles indicate the number of genes in the manually curated vitamin D and folate gene sets, respectively, that were also identified by AmiGO.</p>

<p>Due to their crucial role in various metabolic pathways, a deficiency, or excessive intake of vitamin D or folate leads to a wide range of diseases. Vitamin D deficiency, which affects millions of people worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref007">7</xref>], has been associated with rickets, osteomalacia, autoimmune disorders and disorders of aging like osteoporosis, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref009">9</xref>]. Folate deficiency during pregnancy has been associated with neural tube defects, anemia, cancer, cardiovascular and nervous system diseases. Folate also reduces homocysteine blood levels, thus acting indirectly as well to reduce risk of stroke, coronary and peripheral vascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref006">6</xref>]. Despite insufficient data on worldwide deficiency prevalence of these micronutrients, it is generally accepted that they have a substantial impact on human reproduction and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>In view of their functional importance and dependency on climate and diet, we set out to investigate signatures of adaptation in worldwide populations in gene sets associated with the function of these two vitamins. We used re-sequencing data from 13 worldwide populations generated by Phase I of the 1000 Genomes Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref012">12</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.1000genomes.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.1000genomes.org</ext-link>) and applied an algorithm that we had developed earlier to test for evolutionary adaption in any chosen set of genes. This method compares three frequency-spectrum-based summary statistics (Tajima’s D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref013">13</xref>], Fay and Wu’s H [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref014">14</xref>] and Nielsen’s <italic>et</italic>. <italic>al</italic>.’s composite likelihood ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref015">15</xref>]) between user-generated gene sets and matched control genes using a sampled randomization test and can identify selection signals in a gene set when at least 10% of the genes in the list are under selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>We ran the algorithm using the positive and negative controls from our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref016">16</xref>] to ensure that the selection signals could be identified in the 1000 Genomes Project Phase I data used here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref012">12</xref>], as well as in the Pilot data used earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref017">17</xref>]. As expected, we observed strong selection signals in non-African populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146072.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) for the positive controls, and also in genes involved in the melanin pathway and candidate selected skin pigmentation genes obtained from the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref018">18</xref>]. No selection signature was observed in any population for the negative controls or the list generated using the search term “pigmentation” in AmiGO Gene Ontology (GO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref019">19</xref>], because this long list included many genes not specifically related to skin pigmentation, illustrating the importance of an appropriate gene list in such tests. Similarly AmiGO gene lists were retrieved using the search terms “vitamin D” and “folate” and these did not yield any significant support for positive selection which led us to refine the lists according to the biochemical pathways and the putative targets of these two vitamins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146072.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The vitamin D gene sets that were generated included vitamin D targets identified by ChIP-Seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref020">20</xref>], genes involved in vitamin D action in bones, kidneys and intestines and all proteins involved in the formation of the VDR activation complex, including those directly interacting with VDR (VDRIP) and RXR (RXRIP) receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146072.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146072.s006">S1 Table</xref>). Thus, the final lists for skin pigmentation, vitamin D and folate have been obtained through a careful analysis of their functions.</p>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Signatures of positive selection in vitamin D gene sets</title>
<p>Next, we examined several gene sets involved in vitamin D action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146072.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146072.s006">S1 Table</xref>). Our strategy was to initially screen representative populations from the three continental regions (YRI—Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria representing Africans; CHB—Han Chinese in Beijing, China representing East Asians and CEU—Utah residents representing ancestry from northern and western Europe) using the AmiGO and refined gene sets, and subsequently all 13 Phase I 1000 Genomes Project populations for gene sets in which a selection signal was observed in YRI, CHB or CEU. As the selection pipeline used in this study was implemented using 1000 Genomes Project Pilot data comprising these three continental populations we initially sought to replicate the analyses on 1000 Genomes Project Phase 1 data using these three populations to show that the selection pipeline gave reliable and consistent results using these different 1000 Genomes datasets. Subsequently we extended our approach using all 13 worldwide populations from 1000 Genome Project data. Our aim was to identify signals that were common to continental populations and therefore, less likely to contain false positives. For all our analyses we used a stringent p-value threshold after applying the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing based on 13 populations, the only gene list showing a significant signature of selection was one that included genes involved in vitamin D action in bones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146072.s008">S3 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146072.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). This gene list showed significant enrichment in comparison with matched controls in the CHB, as well as the JPT, Japanese in Tokyo, Japan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146072.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), therefore highlighting a general pattern of selection over a broad geographic area. Compared to the CHB, the signal in the CHS (Han Chinese South China) reached borderline significance and was just below the Bonferroni-corrected threshold p-value. This can be explained due to Chinese population sub-structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref021">21</xref>].</p>

<title>Genes under positive selection</title>
<p>Overall, out of the 627 unique Ensembl protein coding genes in the vitamin D and folate gene sets (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/index.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ensembl.org/index.html</ext-link>), we identified 19 outliers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146072.s009">S4 Table</xref>) in YRI, CHB or CEU with a combined p-value ≤ 0.03 (based upon Fay and Wu’s H [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref014">14</xref>] and Nielsen <italic>et al</italic>.’s composite likelihood ratio tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref015">15</xref>]) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146072.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Tajima’s D test was not taken into account, since significant negative values of this statistic alone are also associated with purifying selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref016">16</xref>]. After correcting for multiple comparisons, the only gene list overcoming the threshold of significance is the one comprising genes regulated by vitamin D in bone tissue. Within this gene set, three genes, (CXXC finger protein 1, <italic>CXXC1</italic>; low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5. <italic>LRP5</italic> and runt-related transcription factor 2, <italic>RUNX2</italic>), were selected in all the East Asian populations. <italic>RUNX2</italic> also showed a signature of selection in the YRI. All three genes were examined in further detail to characterize disease associations and identify candidate variants associated with the putative selection signal detected by the tests based on allele frequency spectra.</p>

<title>Disease association and phenotypes</title>
<p>To investigate the functional consequences of disruption of the selected genes, we mined the available phenotype data in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM—<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://omim.org" xlink:type="simple">http://omim.org</ext-link>), genome-wide association study (GWAS) catalogue, and zebrafish and mouse model organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref024">24</xref>].

The risk allele frequency of this associated variant is 20% in East Asians, and it lies within a 10 kb selected window in <italic>LRP5</italic>.</p>
<p>In mouse models <italic>CXXC1</italic> knock-outs exhibit embryonic lethality and developmental defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref027">27</xref>]. Mice homozygous for a targeted null mutation in <italic>Lrp5</italic> develop a low bone mass phenotype that becomes evident post-natally, and is secondary to decreased osteoblast proliferation and function in a <italic>Cbfa1</italic>-independent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref029">29</xref>]. These features recapitulate the osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome (OMIM: 259770) in humans that is caused by <italic>LRP5</italic> inactivation. Mouse models of two human non-synonymous mutations in <italic>LRP5</italic> (ClinVar: <italic>c</italic>.<italic>512G&gt;T</italic> (<italic>p</italic>.<italic>Gly171Val</italic>); and <italic>c</italic>.<italic>641C&gt;T</italic> (<italic>p</italic>.<italic>Ala214Val</italic>)) replicate the high bone mass phenotype (OMIM: 601884) associated with these variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref030">30</xref>]. Mice homozygous for a <italic>Runx2</italic> null allele exhibit neonatal lethality and skeletal abnormalities particularly in clavicle and cranial bones, recapitulating the underdeveloped or absence of clavicles seen in cleidocranial dysplasia (OMIM: 119600) that has been associated with mutations in <italic>RUNX2</italic>.</p>

<title>Signal refinement and functional annotations of selected genes</title>
<p>Using population differentiation and presence of extended haplotypes we pinpointed putative causal variants that could be responsible for the adaptation signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146072.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). We examined variants in the genic region and 1 Mb up- and down-stream of each gene to look for regions with putative Vitamin D Response Element (VDRE). Variants that were present in these regions were classified as genic (those falling within the coding region of each gene) and non-genic (variants falling up or down-stream of a gene). Candidate functional genic variants were chosen if they overlapped any 10 kb positively-selected window, lay in DNAse I hypersensitivity regions and had an Ensembl functional annotation as determined by the Variant Effect Predictor tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref031">31</xref>]. Candidate non-genic variants were shortlisted if they overlapped a VDRE or an ENCODE annotation as determined by the Variant Effect Predictor tool. We identified three such regulatory variants in <italic>CXXC1</italic>, 11 in <italic>LRP5</italic> and 22 in <italic>RUNX2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146072.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Seven <italic>RUNX2</italic> variants were identified in the YRI and 15 in the CHB. One variant each in <italic>CXXC1</italic> (<italic>rs59393148</italic>) and <italic>RUNX2</italic> (<italic>rs2677100</italic>) and two in <italic>LRP5</italic> (<italic>rs671494</italic> and <italic>rs649772</italic>) had high (≥ 72%) derived allele frequencies in East Asians, and fell in the 10 kb selected window and DNase hypersensitivity regions in cell lines, including osteoblasts, suggesting that these could be driving the selection signal (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0146072.t001">Table 1</xref>). We also identified two <italic>RUNX2</italic> regulatory variants with a higher derived allele frequency in Africans (<italic>rs13201287</italic> and <italic>rs10948238</italic>). An additional two regulatory intronic variants in <italic>RUNX2</italic> (<italic>rs7751427</italic> and <italic>rs7771980</italic>) were also associated with regulatory epigenetic features in osteoblasts and an active promoter regions in several cell lines, but were present at low (≤ 10%) derived allele frequency in all populations. However, none of the candidate variants were associated with any disease or metabolic trait in the GWAS catalogue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref032">32</xref>].</p>

<title>Haplotype Networks and putative archaic haplotype sharing</title>
<p>Median-joining haplotype networks for all three positively selected genes show high frequency haplotypes in East Asians. In all cases the derived allele for the putative candidate selected regulatory variant lay on the branch leading to the high frequency star-shaped haplotype cluster, characteristic of a selection signal (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146072.g003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146072.g005">5</xref>). In the <italic>CXXC1</italic> haplotype network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146072.g003">Fig 3</xref>) the annotated regulatory variant that has the highest derived allele frequency in East Asians (<italic>rs59393148</italic>) lies on the branch leading towards the most frequent haplotype. This haplotype is shared with Europeans and Africans in whom it is present at a lower frequency. All three candidate regulatory variants lie in an active promoter region in numerous cell lines including osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146072.g003">Fig 3</xref>). We also observed haplotype sharing between a subset of East Asian and Finnish samples and archaic (Neanderthal and Denisovan) hominins, which could represent either incomplete lineage sorting or archaic introgression. To rule out the latter, we estimated the length of this putatively introgressed haplotype and the number of differences between human and Denisova. The total length of haplotype sharing between these samples and Denisova was estimated to be ~25 kb, compatible with an introgression scenario as previously hypothesized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref033">33</xref>]. However we detected a five-fold increase of single nucleotide differences between Denisova and the closest observed human haplotype (3 differences as opposed to the 0.6 expected under a simple mutation model after divergence). While these differences might be attributed to within-Denisova diversity, they also point toward incomplete lineage sorting as the simplest explanation for the haplotype sharing. Furthermore, each haplotype found within the median-joining networks for <italic>CXXC1</italic>, <italic>LRP5</italic> and <italic>RUNX2</italic> (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146072.g003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146072.g005">5</xref>) was dated using the approach proposed by Voight <italic>et</italic>. <italic>al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref034">34</xref>] Assuming a generation time of 25 years the age of the most frequent East Asian star-like haplotypes in each gene are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0146072.t002">Table 2</xref>. The selection events in East Asians occurred over a long time frame estimated at ~ 46, 26 and 13 thousand years ago for <italic>RUNX2</italic>, <italic>CXXC1</italic> and <italic>LRP5</italic> respectively, most likely after separation of the East Asian and European populations from a common non-African ancestor (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0146072.t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>A ~6 kb region on chromosome 18 that spans <italic>CXXC1</italic> showing GENCODE (Version 19) transcript annotation. The three short-listed candidate regulatory variants driving the selection signal in East Asians are all located in ENCODE annotated regions of open chromatin, depicted in the DNase I Hypersensitivity Clusters in 125 cell lines track, and show ENCODE chromatin state segmentation associated with an active promoter site in nine human cell lines. The latter include lymphoblastoids [GM12878]; embryonic stem cells [H1-hESC]; chronic myelogenous leukemia [K562]; hepatocellular carcinoma [HepG2]; umbilical vein endothelial [HUVEC]; mammary epithelial [HMEC]; skeletal muscle myoblast [HSMM]; skin epidermal keratinocytes [NHEK] and lung fibroblasts [NHLF]). Positions of histone modifications in osteoblasts are indicated by shaded bands and the black shade signifies enrichment. In osteoblasts the position of the histone sequence variant, H2A.Z, that determines accessibility of the transcription start site (TSS) and histone modifications like H3K4me3 that are enriched around TSS (dark bands) encompasses the candidate regulatory variant site and show binding for many transcription factors. H3K4me1 and H3K27ac modifications and p300 marks are enriched around active enhancers and CTCF indicates insulator regions. The lower part of the figure shows median joining haplotype networks in this region that is in high LD (r<sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.95) in CHB. Phased haplotypes generated by the 1000 Genomes Project were used to construct this network. The derived C allele for the regulatory variant <italic>rs59393148</italic> lies on the branch leading towards the most frequent haplotype found in East Asians, and shows a star like expansion typical of a selection signal. Note the proximity of archaic human haplotypes with a subset of East Asian (ASN) and European Finnish samples. These samples lie on a divergent branch that is closer to the Neanderthal (Nea) and Denisovan (Den) haplotype when compared with the rest of the modern human population samples.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have used re-sequencing data from 13 worldwide populations generated by the Phase I of the 1000 Genomes Project and an algorithm that we had developed earlier to test for evolutionary adaption in genes involved in the metabolism, regulation and action of vitamin D and folate. Both micronutrients are crucial to many metabolic processes as they play an important physiological role in all stages of development. Their dependency on sunlight and diet make them ideal candidates to study the genetic patterns of adaptation to the new environments that humans encountered on their way out of Africa. Furthermore, there is an overlap of four genes associated with metabolism, regulation and action of these vitamins which suggests that these interact as regulators of an integrated cellular machinery controlling gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref035">35</xref>]. We found evidence of positive selection in genes responsible for, or responsive to, action of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> in bones in East Asians (Han Chinese and Japanese). No convincing selection signal was observed in any of the other gene sets including several analyzed folate gene lists.</p>
<p>Selection signals in the genes responsible for, or responsive to, action of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> in bones in East Asians could be attributed to three genes, <italic>CXXC1</italic>, <italic>LRP5</italic> and <italic>RUNX2</italic>. All three lie in regions that have been characterized as being under positive selection in previous genomic selection scans, and in 1000 Genomes CHB populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref036">36</xref>] and contain at least one variant with a difference in derived allele frequency (ΔDAF) ≥ 0.5 among African and Eurasian continental populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref041">41</xref>]. The importance of these three genes can be also gauged from the fact that variants in two of the genes, <italic>LRP5</italic> and <italic>RUNX2</italic>, are associated with abnormalities in skeletal development in humans and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref043">43</xref>]. A missense variant (<italic>rs121908669</italic>; <italic>c</italic>.<italic>511G&gt;C</italic> (<italic>p</italic>.<italic>Gly171Arg</italic>)) in <italic>LRP5</italic> is associated with autosomal dominant type 1 osteopetrosis (OMIM 607634), a disease associated with high bone density and distinct facial features like square jaw. A selection signal in <italic>RUNX2</italic> was also observed in Africans. <italic>RUNX2</italic> plays an important role in morphology of cranium and upper body skeleton and was also among the top 20 candidate selective sweep regions in the Neanderthal genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref044">44</xref>]. Nonsense and missense mutations in <italic>RUNX2</italic> have also been observed in several Chinese patients with cleidocranial dysplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref045">45</xref>].</p>
<p>We used functional annotation, population differentiation and extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) to identify several candidate regulatory variants in each gene that were most likely to be responsible for the adaptation signal we observed. All the candidate variants that we identified had the highest derived allele frequency in East Asians and lay in regions showing DNAse I hypersensitivity or ENCODE functional annotation in osteoblasts, supporting our conclusion that these could be responsible for the selection signal (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0146072.t001">Table 1</xref>). Simulations have shown that the window with the most significant frequency spectrum-based combined p-value lies within the 40 kb region surrounding the selected allele and that the Nielsen <italic>et al</italic>.’s CLR is better at localizing the selection signal due to selective sweeps and is robust to “assumptions regarding recombination rates and demography” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref046">46</xref>]. All our candidate regulatory variants lay either within the selected 10 kb window (<italic>CXXC1</italic>) or were within 500–850 bp of the 10 kb window with the most significant combined p-value and were in high LD (r<sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.8) with SNPs within the selected window (<italic>LRP5</italic> and <italic>RUNX2</italic>). These included one variant each in <italic>CXXC1</italic> (<italic>rs59393148</italic>) and <italic>RUNX2</italic> (<italic>rs2677100</italic>) and two in <italic>LRP5</italic> (<italic>rs671494</italic> and <italic>rs649772</italic>). The two <italic>LRP5</italic> variants were next to each other and in perfect LD suggestive of a multi-nucleotide polymorphism that might have arisen by a single mutation. A benign non-synonymous SNP (<italic>rs3736228</italic>) in <italic>LRP5</italic>, which is also in LD with our candidate variants, is another attractive candidate for the selection signal in East Asians. The derived <italic>T</italic> allele of this variant (<italic>rs3736228</italic>) has been associated with low bone mineral density and risk of osteoporosis. However, the derived <italic>T</italic> allele frequency in East Asians is ~ 20% and it seems unlikely to be the signal picked up by the frequency-spectrum-based tests. In addition, the two candidate regulatory variants in <italic>LRP5</italic> lie on the branch leading towards the selected haplotype in the median-joining haplotype network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146072.g004">Fig 4</xref>).</p>
<p>In comparison with the Africans and Europeans, the East Asians have very high derived allele frequencies for several candidate regulatory variants across these three loci. This enabled us to detect the signal of positive selection in populations from this (East Asia) region. However, as attested by the derived allele frequencies for the candidate loci and the haplotype networks, the most likely candidate variants responsible for these selection signals also have appreciable derived allele frequencies among the other two continental populations, particularly for <italic>CXXC1</italic> and <italic>LRP5</italic>. In Africans an independent signal for selection is also observed in <italic>RUNX2</italic> using the site frequency-spectrum-based tests and there are two intronic regulatory variants (<italic>rs13201287</italic> and <italic>rs10948238</italic>) in <italic>RUNX2</italic> with a higher derived allele frequency in Africa. These findings are in line with the expectation of new environments, diets and food availability acting on the genes associated with vitamin D action in bones and might shed light on alternate mechanisms of adapting to the decreasing availability of UV or dietary calcium.</p>
<p>The biochemical pathway for the production of the active form of vitamin D is fairly well conserved through evolution, thus highlighting the important role of this micronutrient in development and calcium homeostasis. This is also supported by our analyses as we did not detect any signal of selection in the genes involved in the synthesis of vitamin D. However, as vitamin D acts as a transcription factor regulating the expression of genes involved in different physiological processes, like bone mineralisation, different vitamin D targets may undergo selective pressures from various environmental stimuli. There is evidence that the active form of vitamin D and its receptor, VDR, evolved and specialized in the regulation of intestinal calcium absorption that is essential for proper mineralization of the skeleton particularly in environments that lacked sufficient intake of calcium. It is possible that these selective pressures lead to the evolution of target genes of vitamin D involved in osteoblast proliferation such as <italic>CXXC1</italic>, <italic>LRP5</italic> and <italic>RUNX2</italic>.</p>
<p>The evolution of light skin outside Africa has been associated with the synthesis of vitamin D in the skin, as the lack of this micronutrient can lead to the development of impairment that can affect human reproductive fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref047">47</xref>]. The lighter skin pigmentation could have evolved to facilitate homeostasis of vitamin D without affecting vitamin D specific genes. As modern humans moved out of Africa other independent selective pressures, such as new environments and dietary changes, may have affected specific vitamin D related genes (<italic>CXXC1</italic>, <italic>LRP5</italic> and <italic>RUNX3</italic>) with a direct action in bones. Taken together these results suggest that these could have evolved in parallel with the lighter skin colour for improving bone homeostasis and reproductive success. This is also suggested by the fact that none of the candidate of skin pigmentation selected loci are vitamin D targets. In addition, we observe no evidence for an overall selection signal in VDR targets identified by ChIP-Seq and none of the plausible candidate variants in the three selected loci (<italic>CXXC1</italic>, <italic>LRP5</italic> and <italic>RUNX2</italic>) lie in VDREs.</p>
<p>We also observed haplotype sharing between the Denisova, an archaic human specimen, and a subset of East Asian and European Finnish population samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146072.g003">Fig 3</xref>) in a region surrounding a transcription factor binding site in the <italic>CXXC1</italic> genic region. Despite an increasing catalogue of archaic adaptive introgression in humans we conclude that incomplete lineage sorting seems the most parsimonious explanation for this observed haplotype sharing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref048">48</xref>]. Functional characterization of selected candidate regulatory variants <italic>in-vitro</italic> or in animal models will be needed to interpret the phenotypic consequences of the selected alleles and provide a key to interpret the way selection pressures might have acted on these loci.</p>

<title>Data Sets</title>
<p>Protein coding gene sets for vitamin D (n = 44) and folate (n = 32) were initially generated by using the search terms “Vitamin D” and “Folate” in Homo sapiens in Ensembl (Ensembl Genes 72; GRCh37.p11) and AmiGO Gene Ontology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref019">19</xref>], (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://amigo.geneontology.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://amigo.geneontology.org/</ext-link>; 2013-07-27, version 1.8). These initial lists were subsequently refined by manual curation and subdivided into more specific sets according to the biochemical and functional properties of each gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146072.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The vitamin D gene sets that were generated included vitamin D targets identified by ChIP-Seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref020">20</xref>]; genes involved in vitamin D action in bones, kidneys and intestines and all proteins involved in the VDR activation complex, including those directly interacting with VDR (VDRIP) and RXR (RXRIP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146072.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146072.s006">S1 Table</xref>). Four additional folate gene sets were generated to include the following categories: 1) Enzymes in the folate pathway; 2) Folate uptake proteins that included receptors involved in dietary folate uptake; 3) nucleic acid synthesis; and 4) methylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146072.s007">S2 Table</xref>). The latter were sub-divided into genes involved in metabolism of methionine, homocysteine and S-adenosyl methionine methylation (SAM). Four genes were shared among the gene sets for vitamin D and folate. After removal of pseudogenes and non-autosomal genes a total of 417 genes were analyzed in the vitamin D and 214 in the folate gene sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146072.s006">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146072.s007">S2</xref> Tables).</p>
<p>Positive and negative control gene sets described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref016">16</xref>] were used to confirm the reliability of the pipeline to detect signals of positive selection in low coverage whole genome sequences generated for 13 Phase I populations by the 1000 Genomes Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref012">12</xref>], since Pilot 1000 Genomes Project data had been used earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref017">17</xref>]. The positive control gene set was collated from genes that lay in regions identified as being under positive selection in at least 7 genome-wide scans of selection, whereas the negative controls were generated from a list of protein coding genes that excluded those picked up in any genomic selection scan. Additional controls included sets of pigmentation genes that have been repeatedly picked up by numerous genomic selection scans as targets of positive selection. A pigmentation gene set (n = 116) identified by AmiGO was used and this set was further refined into separate lists of genes involved in skin pigmentation and melanin pathways. A published list of candidate positively selected skin pigmentation genes, that included several not identified by AmiGO search terms, was also used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>Genome-wide site frequency spectrum-based selection statistics were used to assess the selection signal. Tajima’s D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref013">13</xref>], Fay and Wu’s H [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref014">14</xref>] and Nielsen <italic>et al</italic>.’s composite likelihood ratio values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref015">15</xref>] were generated for non-overlapping ~10 kb windows from low-coverage sequence data obtained from 13 populations (1,080 individuals) from the 1000 Genomes Project. The Iberian populations in Spain (IBS) were excluded because of their low sample size.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec012">
<title>Analysis Pipeline</title>
<p>Briefly, for each of the gene sets a matched list of control genes was generated from the Ensembl database and frequency-spectrum-based summary statistics compared using a sampled randomization test as described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref016">16</xref>]. The analysis pipeline was implemented using Perl and R scripts and the input data consisted of stable Ensembl gene ID numbers organized into the various gene sets described above. For each gene in the input list the analyses pipeline generated 1,000 matched control protein coding genes from the Ensembl database. Three parameters, namely the gene GC content, length and recombination rate were used as the matching criteria and the 1,000 genes with the least Euclidean distance based on these three parameters were taken as matched controls. One of these matched genes was then randomly chosen as a match for the control list and for each input gene set 1,000 control sets were also generated. For detecting signals of positive selection the frequency-spectrum-based test statistic values were compared between each input gene set and its matched control for each population across the non-overlapping 10 kb windows. The p-values from the individual tests were summarized as a combined p-value using Fisher’s method for combining probabilities as described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref016">16</xref>]. In order to reduce the false positive rate, and in a modification from the earlier study, we estimated combined p-values using only the Fay and Wu’s H and Nielsen <italic>et al</italic>.’s composite likelihood ratio, because negative values of Tajima’s D are also indicative of purifying selection.</p>
<p>The pipeline was initially run to detect signals of positive selection in three populations, YRI, CHB and CEU, derived from the African, East Asian and European continental populations, respectively. Gene sets that showed evidence of selection in either of YRI, CHB or CEU groups were subsequently analyzed in all 13 populations. Selection signals for individual genes were identified based upon whether they contained any 10 kb windows with a combined p-value ≤ 0.03 obtained from the Fay and Wu’s H and Nielsen <italic>et al</italic>.’s composite likelihood ratio tests.</p>

<title>Functional Annotations of selected genes</title>
<p>Genes with significant combined p-values (≤ 0.03, chosen to be more conservative than the standard 0.05) were also analyzed with a custom Perl script for several additional parameters to identify single nucleotide variants (SNVs) that were highly differentiated among the 1000 Genomes populations, as well as to identify putative functional variants. The aim of this downstream analysis was to flag selected genes with variants of interest. The criteria on which we chose these were based on genetic diversity (derived allele frequency) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref041">41</xref>], population differentiation (F<sub>ST</sub> and ΔDAF) and the extent of linkage (LD length) and number (LD number) of SNPs included in LD blocks defined by r<sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.8, calculated with PLINK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref049">49</xref>], surrounding each examined SNP. The ancestral and derived states of each variant were determined by the Ensembl compara pipeline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref051">51</xref>]</p>
<p>We also focused on 1 Mb up and down stream of each gene, using two sets of thresholds for the genic (variants within the coding region) and non-genic variants. The genic variants were shortlisted when showing the following parameters: Derived allele frequency ≥ 0.05; LD length and number ≥ 0; F<sub>ST (CEU-CHB)</sub> ≥ 0.016; F<sub>ST (YRI-CHB)</sub> ≥ 0.032; ΔDAF (CEU-CHB) ≥ 0.042; ΔDAF (YRI-CHB) ≥ 0.070. SNPs falling either within a positively selected ~10 kb window and ENCODE DNAse I hyper-sensitivity cluster were functionally annotated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146072.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). The shortlisted non-genic variants identified in this manner were further refined by application of a more stringent filter based on derived allele frequency (≥ 0.2) and with the additional condition of falling within a vitamin D response element (VDRE). VDREs were identified on the DNA sequence retrieved from UCSC browser for each gene (± 1 Mb) using a custom Perl script. Consensus VDRE binding sites were obtained from a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref052">52</xref>].</p>
<p>The SNPs that, for a given population, passed all the thresholds were functionally annotated using the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref031">31</xref>] and HaploReg (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/mammals/haploreg/haploreg.php" xlink:type="simple">http://www.broadinstitute.org/mammals/haploreg/haploreg.php</ext-link>), a tool for annotation of regulatory variants in haplotype blocks. Genes and variants were also characterized by their presence in human disease databases such as Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://omim.org" xlink:type="simple">http://omim.org</ext-link>), overlap with any variant trait associations with p-value 5.0 X 10–8 in the Genome Wide Association Studies catalogue (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies" xlink:type="simple">http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies</ext-link>) and Clinical Genomic Database (CGD), to understand the potential biological basis for selection. CGD is a manually curated database that includes ~2,700 genes causing human diseases culled from OMIM and the Human Gene Mutation Database Professional. In addition, phenotypes for knock-out zebrafish were obtained from the Zebrafish Mutation Project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/zmp/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/zmp/</ext-link>) and those for the mouse from the International Knockout Mouse Consortium and International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.knockoutmouse.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.knockoutmouse.org/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref022">22</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref023">23</xref>].</p>

<title>Haplotype Networks</title>
<p>Phylogenetic haplotype network analysis of genic regions showing multiple signatures of selection in one or more populations were carried out using the phased data from the 1,000 Genomes Project and the high coverage archaic genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref054">54</xref>]. For each selected gene we established the region in high LD (r<sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.8 or D’ = 1) in East Asians (the population with the lowest combined p-value) and retrieved haplotypes using custom Python and Perl scripts for the African and Eurasian populations from the 1000 Genomes Project Phase I vcf files and two high coverage archaic hominids, Denisovan and Neanderthals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146072.ref054">54</xref>].

Age estimations of the selected haplotypes with star like genealogy was carried out as described earlier assuming a generation time of 25 years. The method estimates age from the probability that two chromosomes are homozygous at a given recombination distance from the selected site.</p>

<title>Schema showing analysis pipeline for signal refinement and identifying candidate functional variants.</title>
<p>For each gene we examined the whole gene length (A) and 1 Mb up and down stream of each gene. Genes (A) with highly significant 10 kb windows (combined p-values ≤ 0.03) were analyzed for presence of highly differentiated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with derived allele frequency ≥ 0.05 (F<sub>ST (CEU-CHB)</sub> ≥ 0.016; F<sub>ST (YRI-CHB)</sub> ≥ 0.032; ΔDAF CEU-CHB ≥ 0.042; ΔDAF YRI-CHB ≥ 0.070). From this we short-listed variants that lay within any significant 10 kb windows in <italic>CXXC1</italic>, <italic>LRP5</italic> and <italic>RUNX2</italic> (B). The number of variants increased for <italic>CXXC1</italic> because the selected window was larger than the gene size (5,962 bp). Finally we curated variants that were in regions of DNase I hypersensitivity (C) or vitamin D response elements (D). The extent of linkage (LD length) and number of SNPs (LD number) included in LD blocks was defined by r<sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.8. Short listed variants identified in this manner were further refined by application of a more stringent filter based on derived allele frequency ≥ 0.2.
