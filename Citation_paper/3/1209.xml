      <abstract>
        <p>Prion infections, causing neurodegenerative conditions such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and kuru in humans, scrapie in sheep and BSE in cattle are characterised by prolonged and variable incubation periods that are faithfully reproduced in mouse models. Incubation time is partly determined by genetic factors including polymorphisms in the prion protein gene. Quantitative trait loci studies in mice and human genome-wide association studies have confirmed that multiple genes are involved. Candidate gene approaches have also been used and identified <italic>App</italic>, <italic>Il1-r1</italic> and <italic>Sod1</italic> as affecting incubation times. In this study we looked for an association between <italic>App</italic>, <italic>Il1-r1</italic> and <italic>Sod1</italic> representative SNPs and prion disease incubation time in the Northport heterogeneous stock of mice inoculated with the Chandler/RML prion strain. No association was seen with <italic>App</italic>, however, significant associations were seen with <italic>Il1-r1</italic> (P = 0.02) and <italic>Sod1</italic> (P&lt;0.0001) suggesting that polymorphisms at these loci contribute to the natural variation observed in incubation time. Furthermore, following challenge with Chandler/RML, ME7 and MRC2 prion strains, Sod1 deficient mice showed highly significant reductions in incubation time of 20, 13 and 24%, respectively. No differences were detected in Sod1 expression or activity. Our data confirm the protective role of endogenous Sod1 in prion disease.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are progressive neurodegenerative diseases which are invariably fatal. They include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle (BSE) and scrapie in sheep and goats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Collinge1">[1]</xref>. They are transmissible misfolded protein diseases caused by the conversion of normal cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) to abnormal isoforms, known as PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. In addition to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> accumulation they are characterised by spongiform vacuolation, gliosis and neuronal loss in the brain.</p>
      <p>Prion disease incubation time in experimental mouse models is remarkably consistent if experimental parameters are kept constant, however, there is considerable variation between different inbred strains of mice suggesting a strong genetic contribution. The prion protein gene, <italic>Prnp</italic>, is the major component where homozygous knockout mice are completely resistant to prion propagation and disease, hemizygous knockout mice have a prolonged incubation time and PrP overexpressors have a much shorter incubation time than wild type mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Bueler1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Fischer1">[3]</xref>. Incubation time is also modulated by a naturally occurring polymorphisms in <italic>Prnp</italic> where <italic>Prnp<sup>a</sup></italic> (108-Leu, 189-Thr) and <italic>Prnp<sup>b</sup></italic> (108-Phe, 189-Val) are associated short and long incubation times respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Moore1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Lloyd1">[8]</xref>. Similarly, a methionine to valine polymorphism at codon 129 of human PrP is also a major susceptibility factor for human prion disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Collinge2">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Mead2">[13]</xref>. Most inbred lines of mice are <italic>Prnp<sup>a</sup></italic> and within these there is still considerable variation in incubation time thus implicating other genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Lloyd2">[14]</xref>. Quantitative trait loci study in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Lloyd3">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Moreno1">[19]</xref> and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Mead2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Mead3">[20]</xref> suggest that although <italic>Prnp</italic> is the single most important factor, the combined effect of several other genes are also of importance.</p>
      <p>In addition to traditional mapping techniques, individual candidate gene approaches have also been employed to identify genes that influence prion disease incubation time. Twenty candidate genes were screened based on pathways and genes previously implicated in prion disease by testing knockout or transgenic mouse models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Tamguney1">[21]</xref>. Under these conditions, most genes had no effect on incubation time, however, knockout of <italic>App</italic> (amyloid precursor protein), <italic>Il1-r1</italic> (interleukin 1 receptor 1) and overexpression of human <italic>SOD1</italic> (superoxide dismutase 1) increased survival by 13, 16 and 19% respectively.</p>
      <p>To test whether <italic>App</italic>, <italic>Il1-r1</italic> and <italic>Sod1</italic> contribute to the naturally occurring variation in inbred lines of mice we used a heterogenous stock (HS) of mice inoculated with the Chandler/Rocky Mountain Laboratory (RML) mouse-adapted scrapie prion strain to look for a statistical association between prion disease incubation time and these genetic loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Lloyd5">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Grizenkova1">[25]</xref>. The <italic>Sod1</italic> locus produced a highly significant association therefore we investigated this further by challenging <italic>Sod1</italic> deficient mice (<italic>Sod1<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) with three different prion strains.</p>

        <p>To look for an association between <italic>App</italic>, <italic>Il1-r1</italic>, <italic>Sod1</italic> and prion disease incubation time we used the Northport HS of mice as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Lloyd5">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Lloyd6">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Grizenkova1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Hitzemann1">[33]</xref>. The stock was generated from eight parental lines (A/J, AKR/J, BALB/cJ, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J, CBA/J, DBA/2J and LP/J) and n = 1052 mice from generation 37 were inoculated with the Chandler/RML mouse adapted scrapie prion strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Lloyd5">[22]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Inbred lines of mice are closely related, however, it is expected that multiple single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) will be present between the parental lines of the HS mice. To select the most advantageous SNPs for genotyping we sequenced the coding region, untranslated regions (UTR), putative promoters (as predicted by PROSCAN (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www-bimas.cit.nih.gov/molbio/proscan" xlink:type="simple">www-bimas.cit.nih.gov/molbio/proscan</ext-link>) and flanking intronic sequence. From this data we defined the major strain distribution pattern (SDP) across the parental lines. This was subsequently confirmed by comparison with genomic sequencing data SNPs generated by the Sanger Institute (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/modelorgs/mousegenomes/snps.pl" xlink:type="simple">www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/modelorgs/mousegenomes/snps.pl</ext-link>) which covered the entire gene starting from 5 kb upstream of the 5′UTR. The main SDP for each locus and the total number of SNPs is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0054454-t001">table 1</xref>. To capture each SDP, one tagging SNP was chosen for genotyping (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0054454-t002">Table 2</xref>). For one SDP of <italic>App</italic> and <italic>Il1-r1,</italic> SNPs were chosen based on putative functional significance (GCF binding site and amino acid change respectively). Other SNPs were chosen based on their ability to tag the SDP. Genotyping was carried out in approximately 400 mice representing the extremes of the incubation time distribution as this captures most of the power of the cross <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Grizenkova1">[25]</xref>. For details of primers and probes see Table S1. For <italic>App</italic>, two SNPs were tested, representing two SDPs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0054454-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0054454-t002">2</xref>). rs47601325 is located in the promoter within a GCF binding site (PROSCAN) and rs46934600 is within intron 2 and is not known to be a functional variant. Neither of these SNPs showed an association with incubation time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0054454-t002">Table 2</xref>). One non-synonymous <italic>Il1-r1</italic> coding polymorphism (Ala71Val) from exon 3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0054454-t002">Table 2</xref>) was tested and this showed a significant association with incubation period (P = 0.02, Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric ANOVA) where the CC genotype was associated with a short incubation time (144±1.6, mean (days) ± sem) and the TT genotype with a longer incubation time (155±3.3). The heterozygous allele CT was not significantly different from CC (145±1.7) suggesting a dominant mode of action. An allelic test (Mann-Whitney) also showed a significant association (P = 0.007, C allele 144±1.0 and T allele 149±1.4) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0054454-t002">Table 2</xref>). A <italic>Sod1</italic> SNP from intron 3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0054454-t002">Table 2</xref>), of no known function, also showed a highly significant association with prion disease incubation time (P&lt;0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric ANOVA) where the GG genotype was associated with a short incubation time (132<underline>+</underline>4.7) and the AA genotype with a longer incubation time (149<underline>+</underline>1.5). In contrast to <italic>Il1-r1</italic>, the <italic>Sod1</italic> alleles appear to behave in an additive way with the heterozygous allele GA having an intermediate mean incubation time (141±1.8). The allelic test (Mann-Whitney) also showed a highly significant association (P&lt;0.0001, G allele 140±1.7 and A allele 147±1.0) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0054454-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>

        <title>Transmission of Prions to <italic>Sod1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> Mice</title>
        <p>It was previously reported that overexpression of human SOD1 in a transgenic mouse model increased prion disease incubation time with the RML prion strain, however, this was not replicated with the 301 V (BSE passaged in <italic>Prnp<sup>b</sup></italic> allele mice, B6.I) strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Tamguney1">[21]</xref>. These transmissions were carried out in small groups (n = 4 or 5), on a mixed genetic background and in the presence of a foreign protein, therefore, to clarify the role of Sod1 we transmitted three different prion strains to Sod1 deficient mice. We used <italic>Sod1</italic> knockout mice B6;129S7-Sod1<sup>tm1Leb</sup>/J backcrossed to C57BL/6J (<italic>Sod1<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) and their litter mates (<italic>Sod1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>) as wild type controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Matzuk1">[27]</xref>.

        <p>Prion strains can be differentiated by biochemical differences in PrP<sup>Sc</sup> or by patterns of neuropathology in recipient animals. Western blotting of brains from infected animals confirmed that there is no change to the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> type caused by replication in the absence of Sod1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054454-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Pathological evaluation was carried out on brain sections from <italic>Sod1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Sod1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice for each transmission with particular attention to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> deposition, spongiosis, gliosis and neuronal loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054454-g004">Figure 4</xref>, Figures S1 and S2). For Chandler/RML transmission, the pattern of gliosis and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> staining is similar, however, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> staining is patchier for the <italic>Sod1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> particularly in the cortex. No hippocampal neuronal loss is seen in <italic>Sod1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice while mild neuronal loss is seen in wild type animals. No differences are seen between the two groups of mice following ME7 infection. For MRC2 transmission there is no difference in the pattern of gliosis and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> deposition, however, there is a reduced intensity of staining especially in the cortex stripe in the <italic>Sod1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice as compared to wild type. Neuronal loss in the hippocampus is very variable for the MRC2 transmissions, however, there is no clear difference between the two groups of mice.</p>

        <p>We have shown that variation at the <italic>Sod1</italic> locus is associated with prion disease incubation time and that this is not explained by differences in mRNA expression levels. We therefore looked at Sod1 protein levels by western blot in <italic>Sod1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> control mice infected with Chandler/RML, ME7 and MRC2 prions and compared these with age matched controls (PBS inoculated mice). No differences were seen between the four groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054454-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). We also confirmed that the <italic>Sod1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice used in these experiments did not express any detectable Sod1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054454-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Although the amount of Sod1 appears the same in uninfected and infected mice it is possible that Sod enzymes are more active in the environment created by prion infection. We therefore measured total Sod enzymatic activity in <italic>Sod1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice infected with each of three prion strains and compared these to uninfected animals. No significant differences were seen between the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054454-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Quantitative trait loci mapping in mice and GWAS in human have confirmed that multiple genes in addition to <italic>Prnp</italic> influence prion disease incubation time and susceptibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Mead2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Lloyd3">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Stephenson1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Manolakou1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Mead3">[20]</xref>. These studies have successfully identified candidate loci but no individual genes have yet been confirmed as functionally significant. Alternative strategies have included targeting genes from pathways implicated in prion disease and testing them directly in mouse models. This identified <italic>App</italic>, <italic>Il1-r1</italic> and <italic>Sod1</italic> as interesting candidates, however, it did not address whether or not they contributed to the natural variation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Tamguney1">[21]</xref>. In this study we carried out an association study for each of these genes in HS of mice. The mapping resolution available in the HS cross at generation 37 is approximately 1–2 cM which is too big to unambiguously ascribe an association to one gene although mapping to SDPs may help to narrow down the region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Grizenkova1">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>App</italic> is a very promising candidate gene particularly given its involvement in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a neurodegenerative protein misfolding disease. There is also increasing evidence for an interaction with PrP where PrP has been implicated in post-translational processing of APP through the inhibition of BACE1 and in some mouse models PrP may bind amyloid-β and mediate aspects of its neurotoxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Parkin1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Freir1">[38]</xref>. Despite its attractions as a candidate we did not find any evidence of an association with prion disease incubation time in this cross although it is possible that other SDPs not tested by us may show some association. <italic>App</italic> may still have a role in prion disease although it does not appear to contribute to the natural variation observed in the parental lines of this cross.</p>
      <p>Il1-r1 is a receptor for the pro-inflammatory cytokine, Il-1, produced by glia and implicated in the disease process as a result of extensive gliosis. <italic>Il1-r1</italic> knockout mice have been previously studied confirming that deletion of <italic>Il1-r1</italic> is protective in models of mouse scrapie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Tamguney1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Schultz1">[39]</xref>. In this study we identify a non-synonymous SNP (Ala71Val) on a SDP that is linked to prion disease incubation time. It is not clear whether this SNP is the functional variant or whether it is carried within the same haplotype block.</p>
      <p>Sod1 is an ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic superoxide dismutase that protects cells from oxidative damage by removing superoxide through converting it to hydrogen peroxide. It has been associated with other neurodegenerative diseases notably amyotrophic lateral sclerosis where mutations in human SOD1 account for ∼20% of familial ALS cases probably via a toxic gain of function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Joyce1">[40]</xref>. Sod1 has also been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease whereby <italic>Sod1</italic> knockout accelerated amyloid-β oligomerisation and memory loss in an AD mouse model and conversely overexpression of Sod1 rescues the cerebral endothelial dysfunction in another AD model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Murakami1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Iadecola1">[42]</xref>. In this study we have shown a highly significant association with the <italic>Sod1</italic> locus and prion disease incubation time thereby confirming its effect on the natural variation within these inbred lines of mice. The functional SNPs remain unknown and we have not detected any evidence for differential mRNA or protein expression. We have also confirmed the role of Sod1 as a protective factor in prion disease as deletion of Sod1 significantly reduces incubation time in two different strains of mouse adapted scrapie (Chandler/RML and ME7) and a mouse passaged BSE prion strain, MRC2. These data broadly agree with previously published data that suggested a protective effect of overexpressing human SOD1 in mice challenged with RML but not 301 V prions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Tamguney1">[21]</xref>. This difference may be explained by the presence of the human protein or by differences in the mouse adapted BSE strains caused by passage in <italic>Prnp<sup>b</sup></italic> rather than <italic>Prnp<sup>a</sup></italic> mice. We cannot exclude the possibility that the targeted knockout of Sod1 in these mice may inadvertently affect the expression of adjacent loci which themselves influence prion disease incubation time and that this would explain the absence of detectable differences in Sod1 expression.</p>
      <p>Oxidative stress has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and is caused by excess reactive oxygen species such as superoxide accumulating with the cell which may be the result of excess production by malfunctioning mitochondria and depletion of catalytic enzymes. In mouse models of prion disease damaged mitochondria have been described as well as evidence for increased superoxide generation and free radical damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Lee1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Siskova1">[44]</xref>. Markers of oxidative damage have also been described in CJD brains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054454-Freixes1">[45]</xref>. We did not detect a change in Sod1 protein expression or total Sod activity in response to prion infection with any of our prion strains, however, the presence of normal Sod1 activity is clearly protective as Sod1 deficient mice show a significantly reduced incubation time across all prion strains tested.</p>
      <sec id="s4a">
        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>In conclusion, we have shown that both <italic>Il1-r1</italic> and <italic>Sod,</italic> but not <italic>App,</italic> are associated with the natural variation in prion disease incubation time measured in the Northport HS mice. In addition, Sod1 deficient mice show highly significant reductions in incubation time of 20, 13 and 24% with Chandler/RML, ME7 and MRC2 prion strains, respectively. Although no differences in Sod1 expression or activity were detected our data highlight the importance of oxidative damage in prion disease and the protective role played by endogenous Sod1 protein.</p>
