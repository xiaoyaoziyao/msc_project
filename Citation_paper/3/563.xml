<abstract>
<p>Tegus of the genera <italic>Tupinambis</italic> and <italic>Salvator</italic> are the largest Neotropical lizards and the most exploited clade of Neotropical reptiles. For three decades more than 34 million tegu skins were in trade, about 1.02 million per year. The genus <italic>Tupinambis</italic> is distributed in South America east of the Andes, and currently contains four recognized species, three of which are found only in Brazil. However, the type species of the genus, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic>, is known from Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guyana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela (including the Isla de Margarita). Here we present molecular and morphological evidence that this species is genetically divergent across its range and identify four distinct clades some of which are sympatric. The occurrence of cryptic sympatric species undoubtedly exacerbated the nomenclatural problems of the past. We discuss the species supported by molecular and morphological evidence and increase the number of species in the genus <italic>Tupinambis</italic> to seven. The four members of the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> group continue to be confused with <italic>Salvator merianae</italic>, despite having a distinctly different morphology and reproductive mode. All members of the genus <italic>Tupinambis</italic> are CITES Appendix II. Yet, they continue to be heavily exploited, under studied, and confused in the minds of the public, conservationists, and scientists.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tegus, lizards of the genera <italic>Tupinambis</italic> Daudin and <italic>Salvador</italic> Duméril and Bibron are important in Neotropical ecosystems as predators, scavengers, and seed dispersal agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref002">2</xref>]. They are hunted for skins and meat by thousands of indigenous and local people, and are important sources of protein and income [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref003">3</xref>]. Tegus make up 1–5% of the biomass harvested by the local populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref005">5</xref>]. However modest the indigenous harvest may appear, the numbers in trade suggest tegu lizards are being harvested at a dramatic rate. Between 1977 and 2006, there were 34 million in trade, with the primary end product being cowboy boots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref006">6</xref>]. Tegu lizards are to varying degrees habitat generalists using forests as well as savannas, climbing trees, burrowing, and using riparian, mangrove, and human-modified habitats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref002">2</xref>]. Their populations must be substantial and resilient to sustain an annual harvest that averages 1.0–1.9 million individuals per year for thirty years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref006">6</xref>]. By any estimate, tegus are an ecologically and economically important clade of lizard. These widespread, heavily exploited species are classified as species of Least Concern based upon their distribution, abundance, and an absence of evidence of population decline.</p>
<p>Imagine, however, that one of these species, <italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic>, was in reality a collection of cryptic species some of which are living in sympatry at some locations. By definition, cryptic species are morphologically similar to the human eye, but genetically distinct. Such populations have commonly been historically classified as a single species. The phenomena of cryptic species is well known and frequently encountered when detailed studies involving morphology, genetics and ecology are undertaken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref007">7</xref>]. Therefore their discovery should not be unexpected, except perhaps for the fact that these lizards are extensively used by humans and have been the subject of hundreds of scientific studies.</p>
<p>The genus <italic>Tupinambis</italic> contained seven species until Harvey <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref008">8</xref>] revalidated <italic>Salvator</italic> Duméril and Bibron for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>duseni</italic>, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>merianae</italic>, and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>rufescens</italic>. The generic split was subsequently supported by molecular work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref009">9</xref>]. <italic>Salvator</italic> inhabits much of South America east of the Andes, and they share a suite of traits (a complete row of supraocular granules, divided caudal annuli alternating with complete annuli, a round pupil, keeled proximal subcaudals, and usually a divided loreal) distinguishing them from the sometimes sympatric <italic>Tupinambis</italic>. Thus, four species, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>longilineus</italic>, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>palustris</italic>, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>quadrilineatus</italic>, and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic>, remain in Daudin’s genus. One of these, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>palustris</italic>, is poorly known and its status seems uncertain. Two of us (GRC, AP) are currently working to clarify its relationship to the other species in the genus.</p>
<p><italic>Tupinambis</italic> is distributed from the Chocó of Colombia eastward to northern Venezuela, (including the Isla de Margarita, Trinidad and Tobago) and the Guianas southward into Amazonia, and the Cerrados of eastern Bolivia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref008">8</xref>]. Three of the four species, <italic>Tupinambis longilineus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref010">10</xref>], <italic>T</italic>. <italic>palustris</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref011">11</xref>], and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>quadrilineatus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref012">12</xref>] have poorly understood distributions centered in Brazil. One species, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>longilineus</italic>, is known to use open, sub-montane tropical rainforest along rivers as well as disturbed areas. Another, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>palustris</italic> is apparently restricted to wetlands in the vicinity of the type locality at Usina Hidréletrica Três Irmãos, in the lower Tiete River, between Aracatuba and Pereira Barreto in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. <italic>Tupinambis quadrilineatus</italic> is endemic to the savannas of central Brazil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref015">15</xref>], however Langstroth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref016">16</xref>] suggested it may also occur in Bolivia. These three species have all been described since 1995. The range of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> is thought to overlap the distribution of all three congeners, and has a range that encompasses that of the entire genus, or nearly so [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>With a maximum body length of 400 mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref008">8</xref>], <italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic> is one of the largest terrestrial, and as previously noted one of the most exploited, Neotropical lizards. Yet, its systematics and nomenclature remain poorly resolved, with some authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref003">3</xref>] describing the taxonomy as “tortuous.” Discussing genetic data Fitzgerald <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref003">3</xref>] wrote, “…the split among <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> from Cuyabeno, Ecuador and Roraima, Brazil was comparable to differences between <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>longilineus</italic> and even to that between <italic>T</italic>. <italic>rufescens</italic> and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>merianae</italic>.” This would be expected in species composed of multiple lineages and given the two localities are separated by more than 1500 km. However, <italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic> has been used in hundreds of phylogenetic, ecological, morphological, and physiological studies given its abundance, size, and availability in museum collections and the pet trade, without the systematic work to clarify the status of various populations.</p>
<p>There are two common, but quite contradictory, names applied to <italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic> in the pet trade and popular literature suggesting differences in coloration, the golden tegu and the black and white tegu. The name "black and white" tegu is also commonly applied to <italic>Salvator merianae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref017">17</xref>]. Beebe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref002">2</xref>] was well aware of the ontogenetic and geographic variation in coloration and pattern in neonate and adult <italic>Tupinambis</italic>. He described them as being black above, spotted and blotched on the head and body, and broadly banded on the tail with bright yellow. Beebe described neonates and young as banded from nape to tail tip. In the same paper he noted a pattern of four longitudinal series of white dashes down the back from the nape to mid-tail. An examination of 53 specimens from Suriname [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref018">18</xref>] and 37 specimens from Brazil and Suriname [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref010">10</xref>] diagnosed <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> as having one loreal, all supraoculars in contact with ciliaries, upper temporals smaller than lower ones, enlarged supratemporals, 94–122 scales around mid-body, 21–28 longitudinal rows of ventrals, a total of 10–17 femoral pores, 13–18 lamellae under fourth finger, 29–39 lamellae under fourth toe, a dorsal color pattern with transverse bands or irregularly vermiculated, and a gular region that could be uniform or spotted. However, Colombian, Bolivian, Ecuadorian, Peruvian, Venezuelan, Trinidad, and Tobago specimens were not included in either of the accounts. Here we diagnose the four species supported by our molecular data and associated morphology.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158542.g001">Fig 1</xref> illustrates some of the varied patterns and coloration present in the <italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic> group. Here, we present a range-wide analysis of molecular and morphological data, strongly supporting the existence of four species-level taxa within what is currently considered <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic>. Morphological data suggest the potential presence of additional species. We discuss the phenomenon and impact of cryptic, widespread species, and offer perspectives for future research.</p>

<p>Confusion over the use of <italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic> (Linnaeus) and <italic>Tupinambis nigropunctatus</italic> Spix is a long standing problem and closely tied to the <italic>Salvator merianae</italic> entanglement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref010">10</xref>]. Hoogmoed and Lescure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref019">19</xref>] and Hoogmoed and Gruber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref020">20</xref>] considered <italic>Lacerta teguixin</italic> Linnaeus and <italic>Tupinambis nigropunctatus</italic> Spix distinct, but Presch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref021">21</xref>] considered them conspecific due to overlapping characters. The nomenclatural problems have been discussed and clarified by Avil-Pires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref010">10</xref>] and we have little to add to her discussion. Using photographs of type material, museum specimens and molecular analysis we conclude the following.</p>
<p>A <italic>Lacerta teguixin</italic> paralectotype, the <italic>Seps marmoratus</italic> holotype, and a <italic>Tupinambis nigropunctatus</italic> paralectotype examined for this study all clearly lack the divided loreal, the small rows of granular scales between the supraoculars and ciliaries and the other traits associated with the genus <italic>Salvator</italic>.</p>
<p>Presch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref021">21</xref>] designated UUMZ 14 the lectotype of <italic>Lacerta teguixin</italic>, restricted Linnaeus’ type locality of “Indiis” to the vicinity of Paramaribo, Suriname, and placed <italic>T</italic>. <italic>nigropunctatus</italic> as a junior synonym of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> because he noted Peters and Donoso-Barros [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref022">22</xref>] separated the two species based on a divided loreal. Presch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref021">21</xref>] found loreals could be single, divide or tripart and that the number of pores, longitudinal and transverse ventral rows, lamellae on the fourth finger and toe, number of vertebral rows, overlapped between <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>nigropunctatus</italic>. We located UUMZ 13, a badly desiccated specimen of <italic>Tupinambis</italic>. The UUMZ database contained the following information.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Lacerta teguixin</italic> # 13. Protologue: 1758: 208. Autoreference: 1749, p. 128. Donation: C. Gyllenborg. Depository: UUZM. Preparation: alcohol. = <italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic> (Linnaeus 1758)</p>
<p>(cf. Lönnberg 1896, no. 14).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thus, it seems likely this was the same specimen examined by Presch (UUMZ 14) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref021">21</xref>] prior to its desiccation, a conclusion previously confirmed by Avila-Pires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref010">10</xref>]. No useful data could be obtained from this specimen.</p>
<p>A <italic>Lacerta teguixin</italic> paralectotype (NRM 121) examined by us (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158542.g002">Fig 2</xref>) has five supraoculars, the first is the longest, the second is largest in area, and the fifth contacts two ciliaries. Three occipitals contact the interparietal scale and there are distinct, nearly round spots present on the dorsal surface of hind legs. The specimen has about 114 rows of vertebrals. All traits suggest it is a member of our second clade. However, the NRM lists four paralectotypes of <italic>Lacerta teguixin</italic> (120, 121(2) 123) and scale counts made on other specimens by one of us (AP) suggests clade four may also be represented in this material. Given the above situation, we select NRM 121 as described above and illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158542.g002">Fig 2</xref> as the neolectotype for <italic>Lacerta teguixin</italic>. Presch’s type locality restriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref021">21</xref>] remains appropriate.</p>

<p><italic>Seps marmoratus</italic> Laurenti is most likely based upon ZMB 849 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref023">23</xref>] a juvenile specimen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158542.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The name has long been considered a junior synonym of <italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic>. The dorsal pattern is composed of wide dark bands separated by narrow light bands and four rows of white spots on the dorsum. It has five supraoculars, first is the longest, the second is the largest in area and the last one contacts two ciliaries. Also, it has 115 or 116 vertebral rows. All are in agreement with our clade two. Here we retain this name as a junior synonym of <italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic> based upon the data we have.</p>

<p><italic>Tupinambis nigropunctatus</italic> Spix was based upon five syntypes and all are extant. Hoogmoed and Gruber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref020">20</xref>] designated ZMA 629 the lectotype, making ZMA 627, 628, 630, 3208 paralectotypes. They note Spix was unsure of his own classification when it came to distinguishing it from <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic>, and thought it to be either a different species or a female <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic>. Vanzolini [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref025">25</xref>] interpreted the Spix type locality to be Belém, Para, Brazil. Photos of ZMA 627 (a male) illustrate morphology that agrees relatively well with our clade two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158542.g004">Fig 4</xref>).

<p>We reviewed the literature and examined illustrations and specimens said to be <italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic> and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>nigropunctatus</italic> in an attempt to understand the characters various authors have attributed to each name. We also consulted researchers with extensive taxonomic knowledge for their opinions on the status of some names. Taxonomic decisions are best made on the basis of recognizable morphological characters and concordant molecular evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref033">33</xref>]. Thus, we reconcile geographic genetic variation with meristic and mensural characters from specimens to produce a robust taxonomic estimate with diagnostic evidence from both molecular and morphological data. This integrates all available data, using the General Lineage Species Concept to delimit evolutionarily distinct clades as independent species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref034">34</xref>].</p>

<title>Morphological methods</title>
<p>For this work we examined 335 extant museum specimens for morphological data [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158542.s002">S2 Table</xref>]. Three previous works [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref018">18</xref>] provide detailed descriptions for <italic>Tupinambis</italic>. However, some clarification as well as challenges regarding scale and scale arrangement terminology for <italic>Tupinambis</italic> are needed. While we use the terms and characters provided in these papers, we made some adjustments. Some scale counts and characters were found to contain information for distinguishing taxa, but most did not.</p>
<p>Some traditional characters were of limited use because the ranges overlapped extensively. These included vertebral row counts (from the occiput to the row immediately posterior to the hind legs), transvers and longitudinal ventral scale rows counts, and lamellae on the fourth finger and fourth toe counted from the articulation points. Scales around mid-body were counted from one ventral around the mid-body, including scales of all sizes and shapes.</p>
<p>Characters that were more valuable for distinguishing taxa included the length and area of the supraoculars (the longest vertebral axis and the largest area). Hoogmoed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref019">19</xref>] described <italic>Tupinambis</italic> as having four supraoculars, and Avila-Pires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref010">10</xref>] noted that a fifth scale is present that could be considered a supraocular; Harvey <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref008">8</xref>] described this scale as a circumorbital. Here we follow Avila-Pires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref010">10</xref>] and consider the fifth and subsequent scales (if present) to be supraoculars, given their position above the orbit, and contact with ciliaries. The number of occipital scales contacting the interparietal scale is relatively consistent within taxa; usually one or three occipital scales contact the interparietal, but occasionally the occipitals become fragmented or granulate in some specimens.</p>
<p>Total number of pores (precloacal + femoral pores) was calculated. <italic>Tupinambis</italic> has a gap between the pre-cloacal pores and the femoral pores. Pores are obvious in males while females tend to have pore-bearing scales with a small pore and a notch extending to the edge of the scale. Pore bearing scales were counted in both sexes. The number of enlarged supratemporal scales was somewhat useful, some taxa tend to have two enlarged supratemporals while others tend to have three. The number of ciliaries in contact with the last supraocular was useful, as some taxa tend to have two ciliaries in contact with the last supraocular, while others tend to have three (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158542.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The shape and size of the largest scales on the anterior surface of the femur were of some use in distinguishing between taxa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158542.g006">Fig 6A–6D</xref>). The position of the anterior inside corner of the orbit (defined as the posterior junction between the first subocular and the first ciliary) over an upper labial was also useful. In some taxa it is over the third upper labial, in others it is over the fourth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158542.g006">Fig 6E and 6F</xref>).</p>

<p>Measurements of body and tail lengths were taken to the nearest 1 mm using a ruler and tape measure. Dial calipers were used to measure scale lengths to the nearest 0.1 mm. Values for paired head scales are given in left/right order.</p>
<p>Univariate analyses of morphological data, Student t-tests, principal component analysis, and cluster analysis were applied when necessary. Statistical analysis was done in Excel with QIMacros and cluster analysis and PCA’s were made using DataLab. Because this project was started independently in the USA and Brazil not all data were collected for all specimens. The USA participants collected about 74 pieces of data on the specimens examined, the Brazilian contingent collected about 27 pieces of data on each specimen. About 12 of these traits overlapped. Consequently, sample size in various analyses varies considerably.</p>
<p>We also used the Guided Regularized Random Forest (GRRF) method to assess interspecific differences in meristic counts and determine predictor importance, with R package RRF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref037">37</xref>]. In this analysis, we used the following meristic counts: lower labials, upper labials, scales around midbody, vertebral rows, longitudinal ventral rows, transverse ventral rows, 4th finger lamellae and 4th toe lamellae. Prior to implementing GRRF, we imputed 46 missing values (2% missingness) using Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), with package mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref038">38</xref>]. We estimated prediction error based on 100 replicates of 10-fold cross-validation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref039">39</xref>] of models with sequentially reduced number of predictors, ranked by importance. When building decision trees in random forests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref040">40</xref>], regularization penalizes the selection of new features for splitting when the gain (e.g. decrease in Gini impurity or increase in information gain) is similar to that of features used in previous splits, a method known as Regularized Random Forest (RRF). A GRRF is an enhanced RRF in which the importance scores from an ordinary RF are used to guide the feature selection process of RRF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref037">37</xref>].</p>
<p>Several of the specimens used in the molecular analysis were also used in the morphological analysis for <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic>, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cuzcoensis</italic>, and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cryptus</italic> sp. n. and the morphological data from those specimens was used to diagnose the four clades; this was not possible for <italic>T</italic>. <italic>zuliensis</italic>.

<p>The Bayesian Inferences (BI) analyses converged very quickly, with PSRF~1.0 and ESS&gt;200 for all parameters. Our results are similar to previous phylogenies of Tupinambinae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref041">41</xref>]. The subfamily is strongly supported as monophyletic (Pp = 100), as are the genera <italic>Callopistes</italic> (100), <italic>Salvator</italic> (100) and <italic>Tupinambis</italic> (98). The placement of the genera <italic>Dracaena</italic> and <italic>Crocodilurus</italic> is not strongly supported, likely due to the small amount of mitochondrial data available for those species. We find weak support for a clade consisting of, respectively, <italic>Dracaena</italic>, <italic>Crocodilurus</italic>, and <italic>Tupinambis</italic>. We also find strong support for all sampled species, with possible paraphyly of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>rufescens</italic>, which includes two specimens of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>duseni</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref003">3</xref>], though this could potentially be specimen mis-identification. Multi-locus nuclear datasets and deeper phylogeographic investigation will be needed to resolve deeper relationships in Tupinambinae and species limits in <italic>Salvator</italic>.</p>
<p>Within <italic>Tupinambis</italic>, we find strong support for a clade of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>longilineus</italic> + <italic>T</italic>. <italic>quadrilineatus</italic> as the sister group to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> sensu lato. Interestingly, the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> group is not strongly supported as monophyletic (Pp = 63). Within the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> group, there are four highly divergent clades that are well-differentiated morphologically (see below). Some of these have been identified already by previous authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref042">42</xref>]. The first clade inhabits the Andean foothills and the western Amazon Basin. The second clade is widespread east of the Andes, in the Cerrado. The third clade appears restricted to the Maracaibo Basin in Venezuela and the fourth clade is primarily on the Guiana Shield and in the eastern Amazon basin.</p>
<p>Each of the clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158542.g008">Fig 8</xref>) is moderately to strongly supported (Pp = 89–96). The Maracaibo and eastern Amazon clades are moderately supported (Pp = 83) as sister lineages, and the Cerrado lineage is the sister group of this clade. The western Amazon/Andes clade is the earliest-diverging lineage. Each clade appears to correspond to a species-level taxon. Note that we have not performed an explicit species-delimitation analysis, but these lineages have already been identified as distinct, putatively species-level taxa by previous authors, and are clearly diagnosable morphologically (see below), while being relatively genetically and morphologically homogenous within each lineage. Their status as "cryptic" species is more a reflection of a lack of historical attention to their subtle morphological distinctiveness, resulting in a taxonomic burden of heritage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref043">43</xref>].</p>

<p>The GRRF analyses indicated that prediction accuracy ranged from 13%, when using the single most important predictor, to 7%, when using all predictors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158542.g009">Fig 9a</xref>). Vertebral rows and scales around midbody were the best predictors of the four species, with a prediction accuracy around 87% based on 100 replicates of 10-fold cross-validation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158542.g009">Fig 9b</xref>). With the exception of <italic>Tupinambis zuliensis</italic>, which was represented by only four individuals, these two variables permit a fairly good separation of the three other species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158542.g009">Fig 9c</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Importance of meristic counts in predicting individual assignments to four species of <italic>Tupinambis</italic> lizards based on mean decrease in Gini accuracy as revealed by 100 replicates of 10-fold cross-validation of Guided Regularized Random Forests (GRRF). The higher the mean decrease in Gini accuracy, the higher the predictor importance. (B) Prediction error of GRRF models based on reducing number of predictors ranked by importance, as revealed by 100 replicates of 10-fold cross-validation.

Considering the morphological data collected for this study, it is clear why these lizards have been confused for more than two centuries. Differences are subtle, the coloration and pattern are variable, complex and have an ontogenetic component. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0158542.t001">Table 1</xref> summarizes the morphology for the four species of the <italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic> group discussed here, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0158542.t002">Table 2</xref> compares the known species in the genus <italic>Tupinambis</italic>.</p>

<p>Here, we provide a taxonomic revision to bring taxonomy into concordance with the molecular and morphological results for the <italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic> complex. The confusion of names presented in these lizards is discussed and illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158542.s005">S3, S3A and S3B Fig</xref>. First, we provide a re-description of:</p>
<sec id="sec009">
<title><italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic> (Linnaeus 1758)</title>
<p>Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158542.g001">1a and 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158542.g003">3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158542.g007">7</xref>,</p>
<p>Diagnosis. (1) Five supraoculars, first is usually the longest, but the second is largest in area (note that in some specimens the first and second supraocular are almost equal in length); (2) last supraocular usually contacts two ciliaries; (3) ventral side of male’s head often uniform black during breeding (4) largest prefemoral scales are imbricate, hexagonal, and longer than tall; (5) three enlarged supratemporal scales form one row; (6) three occipitals contact the interparietal scale; (7) rostral readily visible in dorsal view; (8) indistinct transverse bands, may be mostly black in adult males or with a trace of transverse bands (females); (9) the anterior corner of the orbit is over upper labial three. In the molecular analysis this is clade 2.</p>
<p>Size. The largest <italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic> measured was a male, 279 mm SVL with a 491 mm tail. The smallest was a neonate 84 mm SVL and a 134 mm tail.</p>
<p>Variation. Supraoculars five, (six or seven are not common), the first is the longest; last supraocular usually in contact with two ciliaries; all specimens had three occipitals contacting the interparietal, except one specimen which had two; and all had an incomplete interangular fold; suboculars usually six, one specimen had seven; upper labials 8–10, third or fourth the longest; lower labials 7–8; sublabials 3–5, usually four; chin shields in four pairs, rarely five pairs; lamellae on fourth finger 14–16; lamella on fourth toe 31–36.</p>
<p>Comparisons. <italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic> is distinguished from the sympatric <italic>Tupinambis cryptus</italic> sp. n. by two supraciliaries contacting the last supraocular (three in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cryptus</italic> sp. n); usually three occipitals in contact with the interparietal (usually one in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cryptus</italic> sp. n). <italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic> differs from <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cuzcoensis</italic> sp. n. in having the first supraocular the longest (the second is the longest in <italic>cuzcoensis</italic>); first pair of chinshields are distinctly longer than the postmental (in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cuzcoensis</italic> sp. n. the first pair of chinshields are about as long or shorter than the postmental). <italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic> differs from <italic>Tupinambis zuliensis</italic> sp. n. by having the first supraocular the longest (the second is longest in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>zuliensis</italic>).</p>
<p>Distribution. <italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic> appears to be widespread in the Amazon and present on the Guiana Shield, ranging from the Caribbean Coast of the Guianas to Roraima and Para, Brazil southward to Mato Grosso and Goias and into western Amazonas, Brazil.</p>
<p>Natural History. Because this species has been long confused with other species of the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> group comments on its natural history are difficult to make because they are deeply entangled in the literature with the other cryptic species in the group as well as members of the genus <italic>Salvator</italic>. Considering that <italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic> and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cryptus</italic> sp. n. have been collected within 3 km of each other further investigation of these taxa would be of ecological interest.</p>
<p>Etymology. We propose the English name Common Golden Tegu for this species.</p>

<p>Zoo Bank urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:F107E142-2A05- 4D93-A3B3-2842583EAA80</p>
<p>Diagnosis. (1) Five supraoculars (rarely four or six), first supraocular is the longest, second largest in area; (2) last supraocular contacts three ciliaries (rarely two); (3) ventral side of head usually with heavy mottling and black spots; (4) largest pre-femoral scales are imbricate, hexagonal, and longer than tall; (5) two enlarged supratemporal scales, a second row of enlarged but smaller scales ventral to the two enlarged scales; (6) one occipital usually contacts the interparietal; (7) rostral is readily visible in dorsal view; (8) adult dorsum often has transverse bands that fade with age but are still distinct, does not hold true for the Trinidad and Tobago populations which usually retain well defined bands into adulthood; (9) the anterior corner of the orbit is usually over upper labial four or the seam of upper labials three and four. This species corresponds to clade 4 in the molecular analysis.</p>

<p>There is considerable pattern variation in <italic>Tupinambis cryptus</italic>. Mainland Venezuelan specimens tend to have bands that are indistinct and short longitudinal stripes that Beebe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref002">2</xref>] termed “dashes.” A few are almost uniform in coloration. None of the adults from Trinidad and Tobago have this pattern, although we have seen a few individuals in the field with indistinct bands.</p>

Fourteen males SVL 216–391 mm, x = 281.71 mm, SD = 41.11; seven had undamaged tails 463–635, X = 448.56 mm, SD = 60.62. Eleven female SVLs 183–284 mm, X = 231.0 mm, SD = 39.73; only three had unbroken tails 384–605, X = 481.0 mm, SD = 79.87. Smallest individual measured 85 mm SVL.</p>
<p>Comparisons. <italic>Tupinambis cryptus</italic> sp. n. can be distinguished from the sometimes sympatric and syntopic <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> by its lower number of vertebral rows (average 106 vs 116); three supratemporals (<italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> usually has two); one occipital contacting the interparietal (<italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> usually has three); three ciliaries contacting the last supraocular (<italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> has two); the dorsal surface of the hind legs is uniform in older adults with younger animals having irregular vermiculations (<italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> has light colored round spots—but may also show reticulations); This species can be distinguished from <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cuzcoensis</italic> sp. n., by its lower vertebral scale row count (means 104 vs 119 in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cuzcoensis</italic>); its longest supraocular is the first (in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cuzcoensis</italic> sp. n. the second is longest); the species has a higher average number of scale rows around mid-body (106) compared to 98 in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cuzcoensis</italic>; and the first pair of chin shields are longer than the postmental (<italic>T</italic>. <italic>cuzcoensis</italic> sp n has the first pair of chin shields shorter or about equal to the postmental in length). It can be distinguished from <italic>T</italic>. <italic>zuliensis</italic> sp. n. by having the first supraocular longer than the second.</p>
<p>Distribution. <italic>Tupinambis cryptus</italic> is known from Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela, the Guianas, and as far south as the confluence of the Rio Negro and Rio Branco in Brazil, but its range may be more extensive. It ranges as far west as Falcon, Venezuela, and appears to range into the Andes in the vicinity of Bucaramango, Colombia.</p>
<p>Natural History. The co-occurrence of this species with <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> on the Guiana Shield suggests the previous natural history accounts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref002">2</xref>] are likely a mixture of these two species. However, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> is unknown from Trinidad and Tobago and natural history descriptions from the islands’ populations can be attributed to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cryptus</italic> alone. Our observations of this lizard suggest they use secondary forest, savannas, and human modified habitats. We have not observed them in primary forests proper, but at the forest edge. It may avoid dense forest because of the reduced number of basking sites. Like other species of <italic>Tupinambis</italic>, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cryptus</italic> is a dietary generalist. We have observed this lizard investigating caiman nests, foraging along streams on the floor of secondary forests and in mangroves. Usually their tongue is flicking and they are probing the leaf litter with their head. <italic>Tupinambis cryptus</italic> is most readily observed foraging under the bird feeders at the Asa Wright Nature Center (Trinidad) were they scavenge pieces of fruit.</p>
<p>The ecology of the Trinidad population was examined by Everard and Boos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref044">44</xref>]. They trapped <italic>Tupinambis cryptus</italic> sp n. at six different sites while studying the mongoose over a six year period. Traps were baited with chicken remains. At the Waller Field study site 56 <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cryptus</italic> were trapped during a 23 week period. In a mark and release study involving 40 animals they had ten recaptures; time between capture and recapture ranged from 1–86 days. The animals moved between 0.0–1.2 km (X = 404 m) and they estimated 79.9 (r = 116.3–43.5) lizards inhabited the 104 ha study site. They report the species feeding on leatherback turtle eggs and ground nesting birds (including nestlings and eggs). Trinidadian folklore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref044">44</xref>] states that the young hatch during thunder storms, suggesting Beebe’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref002">2</xref>] observations of females depositing eggs in termite nests is correct for <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cryptus</italic> sp n. Females excavate a chamber in a termite nest (often in arboreal situations), deposit their eggs, and the termites re-seal the nest chamber. The eggs hatch and the hatchlings escape when the termite nest softens during heavy rains.</p>
<p>Etymology. Named <italic>cryptus</italic> for it similarity to <italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic>. On Trinidad it is commonly known as the matte, on Tobago it is called the salempenta. We propose the Cryptic Golden Tegu as the common English name for this species.</p>

The ventral side of the head is uniform in pigmentation.</p>
<p>Distribution. <italic>Tupinambis cuzcoensis</italic> appears to be relatively widespread in the foothills of the Andes and the western Amazon. In Peru it is known from Quincemil (the type locality), Cuzco at about 750 m and goes to at least 827 m (FMNH 81378 is from Villa Carmen, Peru). In Ecuador it occurs in the vicinity of Canelos, near the Rio Bobanasa at about 200 m and, at Zancudo, Napo, Ecuador at about 600 m. It ranges westward into the Amazon Basin as far as Humaita, Amazonas, Brazil and Cuiaba, Mato Grosso, Brazil.</p>
<p>Natural History. Comments on this lizard’s habits can be found in Duellman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref045">45</xref>]. He observed it the afternoon along non-forested river banks, and sunning 0.3 m off the ground. He found six arthropods in one stomach (cricket, spiders, beetles, an ant and an orthopteran). He also reports a clutch size of five from a 274 mm SVL female (cited in a paper not seen by us).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we describe three cryptic species related to <italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic> on the basis of morphology and genetics.</p>
<p>The <italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic> group is morphologically conserved, and when combined with our historical reliance on measurable and descriptive characters, has led us to underestimate the diversity in this lizard complex for almost 250 years. Our attempt to resolve cryptic species with molecular and morphological evidence yields two sympatric and undoubtedly syntopic species (<italic>T</italic>. <italic>cryptus</italic> sp. n. and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic>) that are living alongside each other and cannot be easily distinguished in the field. Each cryptic species represents a monophyletic lineage and three of these species appear to have distributions that are potentially sympatric and syntopic at some locations. Needless to say, we have not been able to rule out the possibility that other cryptic species are present in northeastern South America and, in fact, think it likely based upon morphology that did not agree well with any of the species discussed here. Thus, other species of the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> group remain to be defined.</p>
<p>Hatchling and juvenile coloration and pattern remain to be elucidated for each of these taxa. Our initial thought was that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> hatchlings have wide dark transverse bands separated by narrow yellow or white bands, and that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cryptus</italic> sp. n. hatchlings and juveniles have alternating transverse bands that are about equal in length. However, the Tobago population of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cryptus</italic> does not conform to this pattern, suggesting variation within each of these species is complex and overlapping. Speciation is not always accompanied by recognizable phenotypic change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref046">46</xref>].</p>
<p>Evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref048">48</xref>] suggests that a molecular phylogeny can serve as a sorting mechanism when specimens are examined with the hindsight of this tool. Morphological characters once considered ‘‘individual variation” can be reliable apomorphies for species identification, although these characters are few in number in the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> group.</p>
<p><italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic> has been given two common names, the golden tegu (<italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cryptus</italic>) and the black and white tegu. <italic>Salvator merianae</italic> is also mostly black and white [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref018">18</xref>]. The two species of golden tegus, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cryptus</italic>, both have adult patterns of black, brown and gold/yellow/white, with adult male <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> tending to be darker than <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cryptus</italic> males based upon our relatively small sample of live specimens.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, we found a substantial amount of confusion still exists between members of the <italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic> group and the <italic>Salvator merianae</italic> group. Müller [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref049">49</xref>] named <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin sebastiani and T</italic>. <italic>t</italic>. <italic>buzioensis</italic> based on island populations in southeast Brazil. Böhme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref050">50</xref>] recognized these as belonging to <italic>T</italic>. (= <italic>Salvator</italic>) <italic>merianae</italic>, not <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic>, and reallocated the names appropriately. A recently published paper on exotic reptiles in the Philippine pet trade lists <italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic>, however the accompanying photograph clearly shows a species of <italic>Salvator</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref051">51</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158542.g012">Fig 12</xref> compares profiles of <italic>Salvator merianae</italic> and <italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic>. Data for the number of <italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic> group members involved in the novelty leather trade are apparently unknown. While large numbers of tegus are taken from the wild each year for the leather industry, most of these appear to be <italic>Salvator merianae</italic>, or another member of the <italic>Salvator</italic> clade. Members of the <italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic> group are likely more often consumed as bush meat or enter the pet trade. The confusion between <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> group members and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>merianae</italic> is on-going and basal to the confusion.</p>

<p>The two species have been long confused in the literature. Both specimens were in the pet trade and are from unknown localities. Diagnostic characters are obvious. A. <italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic> lacks granular scales separating the supraoculars from the ciliaries, it has a single loreal scale, and the head is slightly compressed (dorsoventrally). B. <italic>Salvator merianae</italic> has granular scales between the supraocualars and the cillaries, a divided loreal, and a deep head. Also note the tall and horizontally divided lower labials.

<p>Anecdotally, an internet search for photographs of <italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic> produces nearly as many photographs of <italic>Salvator merianae</italic> labeled <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> as it does <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> photographs. Websites such as the Encyclopedia of Life, i-Naturalist, and the Reptile Database have photographs of both <italic>S</italic>. <italic>merianae</italic> and the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> group labeled <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic>. The confusion of these two tegu lizards has been on-going for centuries and carries into their life history descriptions and ultimately into conservation polices.</p>
<p>Early descriptions of members of the <italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic> group depositing small clutches of eggs in termitaria were reported under the name <italic>T</italic>. <italic>nigropunctatus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref052">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref055">55</xref>] for Brazilian and Guyana specimens. Krieg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref055">55</xref>] contrasted <italic>T</italic>. <italic>nigropunctatus</italic> laying eggs in termite nests, to female <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> laying eggs in the ground and guarding the nest. However, his photograph labeled <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> is clearly a specimen of <italic>Salvator merianae</italic>. The current literature suggests female <italic>Salvator</italic> are excavating nests in the ground to deposit relatively large clutches of 20–50 eggs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref056">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref057">57</xref>], while <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> group members lay smaller clutches of eggs in termitaria. These differences in life history traits likely make <italic>S</italic>. <italic>merianae</italic> much more capable of withstanding exploitation, than members of the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref058">58</xref>]. Given the absence of data that <italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic> is present on Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela it is probable that studies and observations on those populations apply only to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cryptus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref059">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref061">61</xref>]. Thus, the reproductive cycle described by Herrera and Robinson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref062">62</xref>] applies to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cryptus</italic> and shows female gonadal mass increasing during the wet season and mating and oviposition occurring in the early to mid-dry season (roughly February to April). The nest is excavated in a dry season termite mound by the female and the egg chamber is then re-sealed by the insects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158542.g013">Fig 13</xref>). This raises the question, do all members of the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> group use termitaria as oviposition sites, or is it just <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cryptus</italic>? Hagmann [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref053">53</xref>] contains photographs of what appear to be <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> from the llha Mexiana, Brazil (about -0.03611–49.602500) that were hatched from a termitaria. Thus, it seems probable that all <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> group members uses this mode of reproduction and it is a synapomorphy for the clade, if not the genus.</p>

<p><italic>Tupinambis teguixin</italic> and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cryptus</italic> eggs incubate until the first heavy rains in June or July. Incubation time is thus on the order of 150–180 days compared to incubation times of about 60 days in <italic>Salvator merianae</italic> which places its nests in the ground [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref057">57</xref>]. There is some anecdotal evidence that female <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> group members may use communal nests and that the incubation time of eggs laid in captivity may be as long as 170 days which supports the 150–180 incubation period suspected in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Recently, Gols-Ripoll <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref042">42</xref>] examined the genetic structure of Venezuelan <italic>Tupinambis</italic> in different bioregions using nucleotide diversity, haplotype diversity and number of polymorphic sites. They found genetic structuring with all three measures and suggest it is the result of historic biogeographic events, the Mérida Andes orogeny and the shifts in Orinoco River (which accounted for 71.2% of the molecular variance) as barriers. They considered the Zulia population (now <italic>Tupinambis zuliensis</italic>) an evolutionary significant unit. Since we have not found evidence of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> in Venezuela, all of their comments likely apply <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cryptus</italic> (and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>zuliensis</italic>). We did find morphological differences between several of the Venezuela <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cryptus</italic> populations which supports the genetic structure found by Gols-Ripoll <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0158542.ref042">42</xref>]. Specimens from Amazonas tended to be dark, almost melanistic with very little yellow pigmentation, and differed from other <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cryptus</italic> populations in having three occipitals contacting the interparietal and a complete fold at the interangular sulcus. The Orinoco populations tend to have a dorsal pattern of distinct transverse bands interrupted by longitudinal lines. However, both populations share the other traits typical of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cryptus</italic>.</p>
<p>Similarly, we found differences between the Tobago and Trinidad populations of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cryptus</italic>. Personnel at the Emperor Valley Zoo in Trinidad told us that specimens from the two islands did not look alike. Preliminary morphological examination of a few specimens suggested they were correct. But in a first comparison of gene sequences between Trinidad and Tobago specimens the animals were only 0.06% different and most of the morphological traits all fall into the range of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cryptus</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Tupinambis cuzcoensis</italic> is the most basal clade and its Andean foothills—western Amazon distribution suggests the Andean uplift may have been involved in its origin. The rise of the Mérida Andes likely isolated <italic>T</italic>. <italic>zuliensis</italic> from the other populations and the eastward shifts of the Orinoco River are likely to have influenced the evolution of the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cryptus</italic> and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic>. The absence of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>teguixin</italic> in Venezuela may suggest that the Orinoco or a marine incursion separated the eastern and western populations and allowed speciation with the subsequent eastward dispersal of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cryptus</italic> to the Guyanas and Brazil.</p>
