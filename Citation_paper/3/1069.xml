<abstract>
<p>Malaria ranks among the most important infectious diseases worldwide and affects mostly people living in tropical countries. Mechanisms involved in disease progression are still not fully understood and specific treatments that might interfere with cerebral malaria (CM) are limited. Here we show that administration of doxycycline (DOX) prevented experimental CM (ECM) in <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> ANKA (PbA)-infected C57BL/6 wildtype (WT) mice in an IL-10-independent manner. DOX-treated mice showed an intact blood-brain barrier (BBB) and attenuated brain inflammation. Importantly, if WT mice were infected with a 20-fold increased parasite load, they could be still protected from ECM if they received DOX from day 4–6 post infection, despite similar parasitemia compared to control-infected mice that did not receive DOX and developed ECM. Infiltration of T cells and cytotoxic responses were reduced in brains of DOX-treated mice. Analysis of brain tissue by RNA-array revealed reduced expression of chemokines and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in brains of DOX-treated mice. Furthermore, DOX-administration resulted in brains of the mice in reduced expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and granzyme B, which are both factors associated with ECM pathology. Systemic interferon gamma production was reduced and activated peripheral T cells accumulated in the spleen in DOX-treated mice. Our results suggest that DOX targeted inflammatory processes in the central nervous system (CNS) and prevented ECM by impaired brain access of effector T cells in addition to its anti-parasitic effect, thereby expanding the understanding of molecular events that underlie DOX-mediated therapeutic interventions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Malaria is caused by the vector-borne transmission of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> ssp. parasites and remains one of the major infectious diseases in the world. The disease constitutes not only a major health burden but also has negative socio-economic consequences, especially in developing sub-Saharan countries. Of the five human pathogens, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic>, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>malariae</italic>, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>ovale</italic>, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>knowlesi</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>, the latter is clinically the most relevant parasite. <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> causes malaria tropica, which is often characterized by severe pathologies such as severe anaemia, respiratory distress, organ failure or cerebral malaria, subsequently leading to coma and death especially in children under the age of five years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref001">1</xref>]. It is widely accepted that CM is not only caused by sequestration of parasitized red blood cells but also is a result of overwhelming inflammatory responses of the host that trigger additional effector mechanisms leading to immune-mediated pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref002">2</xref>]. However, the molecular mechanisms and detailed processes during disease progression to cerebral malaria are not fully understood. Evaluation of the infection in humans is very limited i.e. to the analysis of blood-samples and of post-mortem material due to ethical reasons.</p>
<p>The mouse model of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) using <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> ANKA (PbA) for infection of susceptible C57BL/6 mice is a well-established and valuable tool for analysing the molecular mechanisms leading to this disease, since several processes are similar to those occurring in human cerebral malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Pro-inflammatory processes involving several mediators have been experimentally identified to play a role in <italic>Plasmodium ssp</italic>. infection-induced pathology during ECM and emphasise the complexity of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref006">6</xref>]. Immune reactions during <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection include the activation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, which recognize and take up the infected erythrocytes, parasites or parasite-derived particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref009">9</xref>]. Subsequently, pro-inflammatory cytokines are released, which also serve as a first anti-infective defence. Parasite-derived antigens are taken up and presented in order to activate effective parasite-specific immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref010">10</xref>]. In addition, tissue activation occurs due to the extensive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF and IFN-γ signature cytokines during <italic>PbA</italic> infection. These overwhelming inflammatory processes apparently aid parasite clearance, but also pose the risk of damaging bystander tissue and breakdown of the BBB, thereby resulting in detrimental consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref011">11</xref>]. Importantly, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection and CM can be prevented and treated. The synthetic tetracycline doxycycline (DOX) is an approved antibiotic exhibiting anti-parasitic properties and ranks among approved antimalarial drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref012">12</xref>]. DOX targets the parasite-specific organelle apicoplast, a vestigial plastid derived from a former endosymbiont and which is essential for survival of the parasite. With a delay of 48 hours, DOX efficiently inhibits the protein synthesis of apicoplast-encoded genes, thereby leading to an impairment of the apicoplast’s function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref013">13</xref>]. Due to this delayed effect on parasite replication DOX is rather a valuable tool for chemoprophylaxis but not qualified as a fast-acting therapeutic anti-malaria agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref014">14</xref>]. Therefore, for treatment of severe malaria, the combined intravenous application of artemisinin together with tetracycline, DOX or clindamycin has been omitted some time ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref016">16</xref>]. For the treatment of severe malaria in order to achieve rapid parasite elimination the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT). The current guidelines for malaria treatment recommend the use of DOX solely for follow-up treatment in support of quinine- and artemisinin-based therapies and prophylaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref016">16</xref>] due to its anti-parasitic actions.</p>
<p>Interestingly, besides anti-microbial and anti-parasitic functions, tetracyclines also exert immunomodulatory properties, as has been shown for DOX in diseases such as abdominal aneurysm, periodontitis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and focal ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>The aim of our study was to analyse the therapeutic effect and immune-modulating properties of DOX with regards to the development of ECM during an already on-going PbA infection. We show that DOX treatment successfully prevented ECM and enhanced the survival of PbA-infected mice. Our analysis revealed that inflammatory immune responses and T cell infiltration were markedly reduced in brains of DOX-treated PbA-infected mice that contained large numbers of activated T cells in their spleens. These new observations in regard to the additional anti-inflammatory properties of DOX might be useful for the development of new treatment strategies and could broaden therapeutic options.</p>

Ninety percent of untreated PbA-infected control mice developed ECM (dpi 6–9), whereas all DOX-treated PbA-infected mice were completely protected from ECM and survived this period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192717.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). As expected, parasitemia was reduced in blood and brain tissue of PbA-infected mice that were treated with DOX (Figures B and C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0192717.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Stopping the treatment after 6 dpi led to hyperparasitemia (Figure D in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0192717.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) or anaemia in DOX-treated animals around dpi 20 and therefore mice were sacrificed according to predefined ethical criteria.</p>

<p>In contrast to i.v. injection of DOX, oral administration of either the same dose (80 mg/kg) or an elevated dose of 250 mg/kg given daily from dpi 4–6 did not influence ECM progression, nor did it improve the survival of PbA-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192717.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>).

<title>BBB integrity was intact after DOX treatment</title>
<p>We next investigated whether brains of DOX-treated mice that were protected from ECM showed differences in the stability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), since a BBB disruption, increased vascular permeability and the accumulation of activated T cells in the brain have been considered to be important prerequisites for the development of ECM. Therefore, vascular leakage into brain tissue was visualized and quantified with Evans Blue dye. Brains of ECM-positive PbA-infected mice exhibited on dpi 6 strong coloration and enhanced extravasation of Evans Blue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192717.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>). In contrast, brains of DOX-treated mice were marginally stained and the concentration of Evans Blue dye in the brain tissue was low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192717.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>). Thus, DOX-treated mice successfully maintained the integrity of the BBB, which corresponded with the absence of ECM-induced pathology.</p>

<title>DOX altered inflammatory responses and the activity of tissue degrading enzymes in brain tissue of ECM-negative PbA-infected mice</title>
<p>We then studied whether immune responses in the CNS and in the periphery were altered in DOX-treated mice that were protected from ECM. Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is a key anti-inflammatory factor associated with the capacity to control pathology also in ECM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref023">23</xref>]. To study the role of IL-10 in DOX-induced protection, we investigated IL-10 deficient mice. Importantly, PbA-infected IL-10-deficient animals were still protected from ECM after DOX treatment, which clearly excluded any role of this strong anti-inflammatory cytokine in this setting (Figure E in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0192717.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). For further investigation of protective or alternatively activated immune reactions induced by DOX resulting in prevention of ECM-related pathology, we extracted RNA from the brains of naïve mice, PbA infected WT mice and from DOX-treated PbA-infected WT mice to perform a PCR-array. Brains from control-infected B6 mice without DOX treatment revealed an enhanced gene expression of well-described effector molecules in ECM such as chemokines (CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL2), adhesion molecules (ICAM1) and cytokines (IL-6 and TNF) in the brain tissue of dpi 6 infected mice in comparison to brains of naïve mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0192717.s005">S1 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly, a comparison of PbA-infected mice <italic>versus</italic> DOX-treated PbA-infected animals revealed reduced gene expression of several inflammatory mediators in the brain tissue of DOX-treated mice. The most prominent down-regulation was detected in IL-6 and in a group of chemokines, in particular CCL2, CXCL2 and CCL5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192717.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).</p>

<p>Furthermore, the volcano plot revealed in brain tissue of DOX-treated mice a significantly reduced expression of adhesion molecules L-selectin and P-selectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192717.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), which have been associated with pathogenesis of severe malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref024">24</xref>]. Although we had observed reduced gene expression of CCL5, which is together with IFN-γ associated with cerebral malaria in humans and mice, protein levels of this mediator were reduced in supernatants from brain tissue cultures from DOX-treated mice and control-infected mice, but the difference was not statistically significant (Figure A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0192717.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). In contrast, mRNA levels of IFN-γ measured by RT-qPCR in brain tissue of the respective groups was significantly elevated in PbA-infected mice but not in those treated with DOX after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192717.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Supernatants of brains from both PbA-infected groups contained enhanced levels of TNF family proteins compared to those from naïve animals, but DOX-treatment reduced the extent of this increase significantly (Figure B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0192717.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). TNF is relevant for the induction of metalloproteinases, which are important molecules involved in tissue degradation and destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref025">25</xref>]. To analyse their activity in the brains of PbA-infected mice in comparison to brains of naïve or control-infected mice, we isolated gelatinolytic matrix-metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMPs) from brain tissue of all groups of mice to perform a zymography assay. We detected enzymatic degradation of gelatine in SDS gels in all three groups. While in brains of DOX-treated mice MMP-2 levels were significantly reduced in comparison to brains of untreated control-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192717.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), MMP-9 activity was unaffected by DOX treatment (Figures B and C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0192717.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>DOX prevented cellular influx into the brains of PbA-infected animals</title>
<p>As we had observed a stabilized BBB and less production of inflammatory molecules in DOX-treated mice, we hypothesized that DOX-treatment interfered with the recruitment of detrimental effector cells to the brain. Therefore, we analysed the cellular CD45<sup>hi</sup> infiltrates and production of effector molecules in the brains of the DOX-treated <italic>versus</italic> untreated mice. Granzyme B represents an important molecule involved in tissue damage and cell destruction, which is essential for the development of ECM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref026">26</xref>]. Among the CD45<sup>hi</sup> cells, DOX-treated mice contained fewer CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192717.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>). The increased frequency and gMFI of intracellular granzyme B from these CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that was observed after PbA-infection did not change after DOX treatment (Figures E and F in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0192717.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). However, we found significantly lower levels of secreted granzyme B in by collagenase-digestion isolated brain cells from DOX-treated PbA-infected mice compared to cells isolated from PbA control-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192717.g002">Fig 2F</xref>).</p>
<p>It has been shown that cross-presentation of parasite-specific peptides by brain microvessels to parasite-specific cytotoxic T cells is a key determinant of ECM development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref027">27</xref>]. Therefore, we analysed whether DOX alters local cross-presentation in the brain, which subsequently could influence the cytotoxic activity of brain-infiltrated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. After DOX treatment, the capacity of brain microvessels to cross-present PbA-derived antigen to TCR-transduced NFAT-lacZ reporter cells was slightly decreased compared to that from untreated PbA infected animals, but did not reach statistical significance (Figure G in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0192717.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Our data indicate that DOX dampened infection-induced inflammatory processes in the brain of PbA-infected mice, whereas PbA infection in untreated mice triggers brain inflammation, characterized by recruitment of effector cells, activity of tissue-degrading enzymes and secretion of soluble inflammatory mediators. We conclude that DOX treatment reduced such infection-induced responses on the mRNA level as well as on protein level and enzymatic activity, thereby ameliorating inflammation in the brain.</p>

<title>Increased numbers of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and decreased lytic activity in the spleens of PbA infected mice after DOX treatment</title>
<p>Priming and generation of immune effector cells in blood-borne diseases primarily takes place in the spleen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref028">28</xref>]. Since the brains of DOX-treated PbA-infected mice contained less infiltrated T cells in comparison to untreated PbA-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192717.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>), the DOX treatment might have an impact on effector cells, their local activity in the spleen and /or the cell recruitment into the brain. We therefore analysed the effector cell populations in the spleens of PbA-infected mice with and without DOX-treatment. Importantly, DOX-treated PbA-infected mice presented a splenomegaly with elevated total splenocyte counts as well as increased numbers of splenic CD8 T cells compared to spleens of naïve and PbA infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192717.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref> and Figure A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0192717.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>Although surface expression of C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) on splenic T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192717.g003">Fig 3D</xref>) and the frequency of T cells expressing intracellular granzyme B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192717.g003">Fig 3E</xref>) were not altered between DOX-treated mice and untreated PbA-infected mice, surface expression of CD69, a marker for general T cell activation, was significantly reduced on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells after DOX treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192717.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), suggesting a reduced T cell activation. Other markers that are associated with T cell activity were either found to be unchanged between PbA-infected groups with or without DOX treatment, such as PD-1 (Figure B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0192717.s003">S3 Fig</xref>) or were slightly reduced after DOX treatment without reaching statistical significance, such as ICAM-1 and CD40L (Figures B and C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0192717.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we analysed the impact of the DOX-treatment on parasite-antigen-specific activities of splenic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Although the <italic>in vivo</italic> antigen-specific CTL lysis and the capacity of splenic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from DOX-treated mice to produce IFN-γ was not significantly impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192717.g003">Fig 3F and 3H</xref>), in contrast, IFN-γ serum levels were decreased in DOX-treated mice compared to control-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192717.g003">Fig 3H</xref>), indicating a reduced level of Th1 cytokines.</p>
<p>Thus, although DOX-treated mice contained peripheral CD8+ T cells displaying a similar activation phenotype compared to T cells from untreated control-infected mice suffering from ECM, these T cells accumulated in their spleens and were hardly detectable in the brains—in contrast to untreated control mice. We conclude that this apparently impaired recruitment of effector cells upon DOX treatment—together with a reduced antigen load in the brain—contributed to an attenuated inflammation and ECM protection.</p>

<title>Elevated parasite dose could not reverse DOX-mediated ECM protection</title>
<p>As we demonstrated above, DOX treatment of PbA-infected mice led to complete protection from ECM and also to an arrest of parasite growth on day 6 p.i.

To rule out that the DOX-mediated decrease of parasitemia was solely responsible for the ECM protection, we determined the parasitemia of untreated PbA-infected mice on day 6, which is the time point of ECM onset.

<p>Titration experiments regarding the infectious dose revealed that an infection with 1*10<sup>6</sup> iRBC, which is a 20-fold increase of the parasite dose compared to the previous experiments, was sufficient to establish a parasitemia of approximately 8% on day 6 even after DOX treatment, thereby equivalent to the parasitemia of untreated mice infected with 5x10<sup>4</sup> iRBC, which all died from CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192717.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, see PbA 5e4 versus PbA 1e6 +DOX on 6 dpi). Survival and ECM development of mice that had received an elevated dose of parasites did not differ from those mice that had been infected with the lower dose of parasites that has been used in the other experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192717.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>).

<p>Taken together, these results showed that DOX-induced protection from ECM was stable, indicating that DOX exerts strong immune-regulatory functions–in addition to its anti-parasitic effects—that inhibited disease progression by modulation of the inflammatory responses against PbA.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we show that the tetracycline DOX, in addition to its described anti-parasitic effects, is able to ameliorate inflammation in PbA-infected mice resulting in protection from ECM.</p>
<p>DOX targets a specific and essential organelle in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites, the apicoplast, which is a bacterial remnant from a former endosymbiont, thereby inhibiting further development and division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref029">29</xref>]. A recent summary of optimized tetracyclines and their anti-malarial efficacy highlights the importance of tetracyclines as a prophylactic and treatment strategy in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> ssp. infection with a focus on its anti-parasitic effects that have been well known for a long time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref030">30</xref>]. However, DOX has also been described to influence immune responses of the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref031">31</xref>] by dampening pro-inflammatory reactions in pathogen-induced inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref032">32</xref>] and by reducing vascular degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref033">33</xref>]. This prompted us to investigate the capacity of DOX in protecting PbA-infected mice from ECM, a valuable translational model allowing detailed <italic>ex vivo</italic> analysis during an on-going infection. Indeed, we show here that daily intravenous administration of 80 mg/kg DOX starting on d+4 p.i. was able to protect PbA-infected C57BL/6 mice from BBB breakdown and prevented in an IL-10-independent manner the development of ECM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192717.g001">Fig 1</xref> and Figure E is <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0192717.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), which is mainly dependent on inflammatory cytokines such as granzyme B and cytotoxic T cells as supported by various animal studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<p>Analysis of brain tissue by an RNA array revealed that DOX treatment of PbA-infected mice impaired the expression of chemokine, cytokine and adhesion molecules associated with inflammation and endothelial cell activation and BBB damage compared to control-infected mice. DOX treatment modulated CCL5, which is induced in the brain upon PbA infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref034">34</xref>]. This is in line with recent studies on post-mortem tissue samples from human patients that demonstrated an association of CCL5 with cerebral malaria. It was shown that samples from CM patients contained elevated levels of CCL5 and its cognate receptor CCR5 compared to non-CM controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref035">35</xref>]. Moreover, CCL5 apparently does not only act as a recruitment factor, it also has been related to the effector function of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref036">36</xref>]. Deficiency in CCR5 or interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP10) both responsible for T cell recruitment under inflammatory conditions, confers resistance to ECM and reduces T cell migration to the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref038">38</xref>]. Importantly, Hirako et al. demonstrated recently the impact of CXCL9/10+ MO-DCs in the recruitment and activation of T cells, thereby promoting neuroinflammation and ECM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref039">39</xref>]. The relevance of these chemokines in the DOX mediated protection will be interesting to address in the future. Especially CXCL10 is an interesting candidate as de Paula Costa et al. showed a reduction of its mRNA expression in cardiac tissue from <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> infected dogs that had been treated with doxycycline in combination with benznidazole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref040">40</xref>].</p>
<p>Activated effector T cells have been accounted to play a decisive role in the disruption of the BBB and disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref041">41</xref>]. Parasite-specific cell-mediated responses increase systemic and local inflammation, leading to an activation of endothelial cells; genetically deficient mice or depletion strategies had impressively demonstrated the importance of adhesion molecules such the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), P-selectin on activated endothelial cells and leukocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref043">43</xref>] in the induction of ECM. In addition, local effector processes such as intravascular accumulation of leukocytes and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref044">44</xref>] and the production of granzyme B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref026">26</xref>] and perforin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref046">46</xref>] during ECM are well described. In particular, the recruitment of armed effector T cells to local tissue is discussed to be a critical step in ECM pathogenesis.</p>
<p>Antigen-specificity as well as effector function of T cells and a fully functional antigen-presentation have been shown to be indispensable for ECM induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref047">47</xref>]. A key finding was our results that PbA-infected mice that did not develop ECM after DOX treatment displayed slightly diminished activation in general (CD69, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192717.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) but no significant reduction of cytotoxic activity of splenic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192717.g003">Fig 3D and 3G</xref>). Activation of T cells is essential for the induction of effector functions such as T cell cytotoxicity, which is a tightly regulated process and several signals like antigen-recognition, co-stimulation and cytokine-induced polarization are required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref048">48</xref>]. Importantly, these effector T cells accumulated in the spleens of the DOX treated mice, whereas we observed reduced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell levels and less granzyme B production in the brains of DOX treated mice, pointing towards an influence of DOX on T cell migration and local activity compared to control-infected ECM-positive mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192717.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Importantly, a recent study by Shaw et al. demonstrated similar accumulation patterns of brain-infiltrating T cells in both ECM-inducing and ECM–non-inducing infections. They observed clustering of the T cells in perivascular spaces of the brains in both models; however, only in ECM-positive brains, a cognate interaction between T cells and cross-presenting endothelial cells occurred, probably leading to alteration of tight junction proteins and increased vascular permeability and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref049">49</xref>]. The authors suggested that in non-ECM infections, perivascular T cells fail to recognize their cognate antigen, restricting their pathogenic activity, including the secretion of cytotoxic mediators and thereby preventing ECM development. According to this hypothesis, we suggest that upon DOX treatment, communication between cells presenting parasite-derived antigen and CTLs in the brain might be impeded, also contributing to a mitigation of ECM.</p>
<p>In addition to granzyme B secretion by T cells, it could not yet be clarified whether additional differences may account for protection. Our data indicate an impact of DOX on T cell degranulation, since we observed significantly impaired granzyme B secretion in the brains of DOX treated mice in comparison to untreated animals. Several studies have shown that tetracyclines themselves can inhibit degranulation of stimulated antigen-specific T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref051">51</xref>], offering a possible mechanism by which cytotoxicity of activated T cells can be inhibited. Degranulation of fully activated antigen-specific T cells is highly dependent on vesicular trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref052">52</xref>]. Thus, it would be interesting to investigate in the future whether DOX indeed is able to inhibit degranulation in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection in more detail.</p>
<p>The stabilized BBB in ECM-negative DOX-treated mice was another central finding of our study. We observed an up-regulation and increased activity of gelatinolytic matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in brains of PbA-induced ECM-positive mice, whereas DOX-treated mice that were protected from ECM, contained reduced levels of MMP2 in their brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192717.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). This supports the idea that enzyme activity may play a role in BBB disruption and disease progression i.e. by impaired access of T cells to the brain. MMPs are involved in endothelial cell and tissue damage, and both MMP2 and MMP9 have been proposed to be responsible for BBB disruption during <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref053">53</xref>] and described to be significantly inhibited by DOX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref019">19</xref>]. MMP2 is constitutively expressed while the expression of MMP9 is inducible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref054">54</xref>], which might explain differences in protein activity. Although we and others could show an up-regulation of either MMP-2 or MMP-9 during ECM pathology, MMP-9 deficient mice were similarly susceptible to ECM development as WT mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref055">55</xref>]. This, however, does not argue against a functional role of MMPs in ECM, since MMPs have overlapping functions and may compensate for each other.</p>
<p>DOX-mediated inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and an amelioration of immune-mediated pathology were observed in several diseases and disease models like abdominal aneurysm, periodontitis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and focal ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Importantly, MMP-2 is a molecule strongly linked to TNF, a well-known inducer of tissue degrading MMP-2 and MMP-9 in brain pericytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref056">56</xref>] and microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref057">57</xref>]. Our experiments show that independently of cellular infiltrates and antigen presentation, TNF was strongly reduced on mRNA level and in primary brain tissue cultures after DOX treatment (Figure B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0192717.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) and may therefore be responsible for changes in MMP-2 expression. Reduced levels of TNF superfamily members, indicating diminished local inflammation, could further contribute to the protection from ECM pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref058">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref059">59</xref>]. Thus, although a key role for the TNF superfamily in CM is controversially discussed, a contribution to the pathology by regulating MMP activities seems possible and supports its participation by secondary effects. Moreover, several studies describe minocycline, another tetracycline derivative, as having the ability to attenuate T cell-microglia interactions, cytokine production and MMP activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref020">20</xref>]. Minocycline also acts as an inhibitor of mononuclear phagocytes, and reduces TNF expression, proliferation and degranulation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref051">51</xref>]. This might contribute to the DOX-mediated protection, alongside other factors.</p>
<p>While DOX treatment led to a reduction in blood parasitemia, animals that had received a high parasitic dose to yield a similar parasitemia to that seen in ECM-positive untreated mice were still protected by DOX from ECM. These findings support the hypothesis that DOX exerts crucial effects on inflammatory immune reactions in this system, leading to protection of mice from ECM. A correlation with reduction of parasite mass indicated that DOX induced apparently a combination of anti-parasitic and anti-inflammatory effects. A recent study suggests that also artesunate may have additional anti-inflammatory properties in ECM treatment; since parasite numbers were reduced even stronger than after DOX, it is difficult to dissect both effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref060">60</xref>]. An immunosuppressive effect of artemisinin and its derivatives was also reported for several other diseases and experimental models, including arthritis, experimental colitis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref061">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192717.ref064">64</xref>]. Importantly, this considerable finding should be analysed in more detail first in translational models to improve the understanding of the molecular action of these drugs as well as the therapeutic options for patients. Future approaches should also address the combined application of artesunate- the fast-acting first-choice antimalarial drug given i.v. in severe Malaria tropica—together with DOX in the ECM model to examine a potential beneficial impact on disease course after ECM onset, closer to severe malaria and relevant for treatment of diseased humans, beyond our intervention studies at an early stage of disease.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the data emphasize the importance of translational models and suggest that DOX treatment of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection should be beneficial for the infected host through anti-inflammatory, BBB-stabilizing and MMP-inhibiting properties in addition to anti-parasitic effects that could work in concert with fast-acting anti-malarial drugs given in combination. Retrospective meta-analyses might elucidate the immunomodulatory impact of DOX and other anti-malarials that have only been correlated with an anti-parasitic effect so far.</p>
<p>A better understanding of molecular mechanisms occurring during cerebral malaria and therapeutic interventions by detailed drug research may result in better treatment strategies for patients infected with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> and other CM patients in the future.</p>

<title>No reduction of CCL5, MMP-9 enzyme activity, IFN-γ, or cross-presenting activity after DOX treatment.</title>
<p>Determination of CCL5 (A) and TNF (B) secretion from brain homogenates isolated from brains of naïve and PbA-infected mice ±DOX via ELISA. (B) On dpi 6, supernatants of overnight cultures from isolated primary brain cells were analyzed for TNF family. Representative graphs of two independent experiments with 4–5 mice/group are shown. (C) Six days post PbA infection brain tissue of C57BL/6 naïve mice and infected ± 80 mg/kg/day DOX were examined for MMP expression/ activity and granzyme B production. For enzymatic analysis brain tissue was subjected to zymography. Gelatine zymography of brain tissue extracted on day 6 p.i. (D) Quantification by scanning densitometry of the gelatinolytic bands of proMMP-9. Representative experiments are shown with 6–7 mice/ group. Relative scanning units of MMP-9 are shown as fold change against expression of naïve animals displayed as median and statistically tested with the Kruskal-Wallis-test followed by the Dunns post-hoc test. On day 6 p.i. cells from brains of naïve or PbA-infected mice with or without DOX treatment were identified as CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with the help of flow cytometry and further analyzed for granzyme B frequency (E) and gMFI (F). (G) Cross-presentation assay from brain microvessels. Naïve, untreated or DOX-treated mice were sacrificed on day 6 post infection. Brain microvessels were isolated and co-cultured with LR-BSL8.4 reporter cells to detect cross-presentation of a PbA epitope. Blue spots stained with X-gal were counted. Data were log-transformed to meet parametric standards. Graphs represent one of 2–3 independent experiments with 5–6 animals/group. Data are displayed as mean and statistically analyzed with 1-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test. *p&lt;0.05 after analysis of normal distribution.</p>

<title>Evans blue assay in PbA (high) infected mice after DOX treatment.</title>
<p>Brains of PbA (low) and PbA (high) ± DOX mice were analyzed on day 6 p.i. for BBB integrity with the help of an Evans Blue assay. All groups of mice received i.v. 2% Evans Blue dye in NaCl, which was allowed to circulate in the blood for one hour. Thereafter, brains were harvested and incubated in formamide for 48h. Extravasation of the dye into the brain was quantified by measuring the absorbance of the dye that had been extracted by formamide at 620nm. Data are displayed as mean and statistically analyzed with Mann-Whitney U test. p&lt;0.05 was considered significant.</p>
