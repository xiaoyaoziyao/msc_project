        <p>G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) are involved in the regulation of numerous physiological functions. Therefore, GPCR variants may have conferred important selective advantages during periods of human evolution. Indeed, several genomic loci with signatures of recent selection in humans contain GPCR genes among them the X-chromosomally located gene for GPR82. This gene encodes a so-called orphan GPCR with unknown function. To address the functional relevance of GPR82 gene-deficient mice were characterized. GPR82-deficient mice were viable, reproduced normally, and showed no gross anatomical abnormalities. However, GPR82-deficient mice have a reduced body weight and body fat content associated with a lower food intake. Moreover, GPR82-deficient mice showed decreased serum triacylglyceride levels, increased insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, most pronounced under Western diet. Because there were no differences in respiratory and metabolic rates between wild-type and GPR82-deficient mice our data suggest that GPR82 function influences food intake and, therefore, energy and body weight balance. GPR82 may represent a thrifty gene most probably representing an advantage during human expansion into new environments.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>With the availability of large public data sets, the knowledge of many mammalian genomic sequences, and large-scale genotyping resources, numerous loci which have potentially been under selection in the entire human species, or locally in specific human populations have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Akey1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Bustamante1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Nielsen1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Nielsen2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Sabeti1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Voight1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Sabeti2">[7]</xref>. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) represent the largest gene family in vertebrate genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Gloriam1">[8]</xref> and participate in the regulation of almost every physiological function. It is therefore very likely that GPCR variants provided selective advantage during periods of human evolution. Consistently, meta-analysis of genomic scans for signatures of selection revealed a number of such loci containing GPCR genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Strotmann1">[9]</xref>. The X-chromosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK) locus which contains two orphan rhodopsin-like GPCR, GPR34 and GPR82, is one of these genomic regions and displays significant signatures of recent selection in human populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Voight1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Both, GPR34 and GPR82 belong to the group of P2Y<sub>12</sub>-like receptors, all structurally related to the clopidogrel-sensitive ADP receptor P2Y<sub>12</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Hollopeter1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Foster1">[11]</xref>. Other members of the P2Y<sub>12</sub>-like receptor group are the ADP receptor P2Y<sub>13</sub>, the UDP-glucose receptor P2Y<sub>14</sub>, and the orphan receptors GPR87 and GPR171 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Schoneberg1">[12]</xref>. Recently, several members of the P2Y<sub>12</sub>-like receptor group have been assigned to nucleotide derivates and lipids as physiological ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Tabata1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Nonaka1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Sugo1">[15]</xref> among them GPR34 as receptor for <italic>lyso</italic>-phosphatidylserine (<italic>lyso</italic>-PS), a finding that is still under discussion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Yin1">[16]</xref>. GPR82 was first discovered by mining GenBank for novel GPCR sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Lee1">[17]</xref>. However, the link between both, the potential selection of the genomic locus containing GPR34 and GPR82 and the physiological relevance of the two GPCR is still unknown.</p>
      <p>Herein, we provide further evidence of recent selection at the human X-chromosomal CASK locus. Fine-mapping of this locus by sequencing a 10-kbp region in two human populations supported this finding. Because the functional relevance of CASK and GPR34 was studied elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Atasoy1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Liebscher1">[19]</xref> we addressed the physiological relevance of the orphan receptor GPR82 by characterizing a GPR82-deficient (KO) mouse strain. KO mice show a distinct phenotype with reduced body weight, body fat content and food intake compared to their wild-type (WT) littermates. Further, in GPR82-deficient mice the triacylglyceride (TAG) levels in plasma and in LDL and VLDL lipoprotein fractions are reduced and glucose tolerance is increased. Our data indicate a role of GPR82 in the regulation of energy homoeostasis in mice suggesting this orphan GPCR as a candidate gene for optimal energy accumulation during human evolution.</p>

        <p>The X-chromosomal CASK locus, which contains the two orphan GPCR, GPR34 and GPR82, attracted our attention because it showed high significance in iHS (Integrated Haplotype Score) analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Voight1">[6]</xref>. To verify these initial findings SNP data of the CASK locus from European, Asian and African HapMap individuals and a data set of a local European population (Sorbs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Tonjes1">[20]</xref>) were analyzed with additional statistical methods (Tajimas D, Fu/Li D and F tests). In contrast to European and African samples, Asian individuals showed no SNP variations (monomorph) indicating a long, recently fixed haplotype. To properly analyze the monomorphic Asian (HCB) data set, the ancestral sequence was used for contrasting purposes. As presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0029400-t001">Table 1</xref>, the SNP analyses of the HapMap European (CEU) and Chinese (HCB) data set revealed significant signatures of selection in more than one test.</p>

        <p>All methods applied above (Tajimas D, Fu/Li D and F) test for reduction of genetic diversity and excess of rare alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Sabeti1">[5]</xref>. Although these tests can be performed with SNP data, biased SNP assignments may mask genetic diversity in some populations (e.g. in Asians). Therefore, we sequenced a 10-kbp genomic fragment in Asian and Sub-Saharan African individuals (only hemizygous male individuals to doubtlessly assign haplotypes). Again, Asian individuals were almost monomorph whereas African individuals displayed several haplotypes. Analyses confirmed highly significant D and F values all consistent with recent selection of the CASK locus in the Asian population (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0029400-t001">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, the haplotypes were identical in individuals from distant geographic regions (Beijing/China, Korea, Vietnam).</p>
        <p>Taken together, our data are compatible with the hypothesis that the CASK locus underwent recent selection in human populations. This locus contains three genes, CASK, GPR34 and GPR82. Because the functional relevance of CASK and GPR34 has recently been evaluated (see <italic><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref></italic>) but not the one of GPR82, we studied this orphan GPCR in more detail.</p>

        <title>GPR82-deficient mice are lean, have decreased triacylglyceride plasma levels and improved glucose tolerance</title>
        <p>GPR82 is structurally related to P2Y<sub>12</sub>-like receptors and became relevant in the very early vertebrate evolution. Although present in most vertebrate genomes GPR82 function is not required for unknown reasons in some fish (puffer fish), reptile (anole) and mammalian (otolemur) species (details on GPR82 evolution are provided on request). GPR82 is ubiquitously expressed with highest mRNA levels in epididymis, testis and hypothalamus (<italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s011">Table S1</xref></italic>). GPR82 shows conserved transcript and promoter structures indicating that the GPR82 gene is functional in mouse and human (<italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s001">Figure S1</xref></italic>). To date, the endogenous agonist is unknown and all our attempts to determine the G protein-coupling abilities failed so far (data not shown).</p>
        <p>To gain insight into the functional relevance of GPR82, a GPR82-deficient mouse line was established by targeted gene deletion (<italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s023">Methods S1</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s002">Figure S2</xref></italic>). The mice background was C3HeB/FeJ and animals of generations &gt;12 were used for the study. Because the GPR82 gene lies within an intron of the CASK gene and the targeting construct may affect CASK expression CASK mRNA levels were quantified in different tissues of WT and KO. As shown in <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s002">Figure S2C</xref></italic> there were no significant differences in mRNA expression levels of CASK.</p>
        <p>Because of the X-chromosomal localization of GPR82 heterozygous females were mated with WT and KO males to produce all possible genotypes of both sexes. Offspring of all genotypes were vital and fertile. Although the genotype distribution was as expected when KO males were mated with heterozygous females, there was a preference of the KO allele in WT male/heterozygous female matings (<italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s003">Figure S3</xref></italic>). The reason remains unclear.</p>
        <p>Because GPR82 is widely expressed, 3-month-old mice were subjected to a hypothesis-free phenotypic screen. This included morphological and histological measures, behavioral tests and hematological and chemical assessment of blood samples (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0029400-t002">Table 2</xref>). Most obvious KO mice developed a lower body weight compared to their WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029400-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s005">Figure S5</xref></italic>). To further investigate this difference, 3-month-old animals were dissected and organs and tissues were morphologically and histologically analyzed. Organs showed no gross histological differences and no or a rather small reduction in the absolute weight (<italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s012">Table S2</xref></italic>) suggesting that tissues not included in the weight analysis, such as adipose tissue, muscles and bones, account for the differences. Quantitative magnetic resonance (QMR) analyses revealed that KO mice of both genders have a significant lower absolute and relative body fat content compared to WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029400-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s015">Table S5</xref></italic>). The lean mass relative to the body weight was significantly higher in KO than in WT mice (<italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s015">Table S5</xref></italic>). A reduced visceral fat mass in KO animals was obvious during dissection of peritoneal organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029400-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). As determined from histological sections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Bluher1">[21]</xref>, the average size of adipocytes in perigonadal fat pads was significantly lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029400-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Further, increased hepatic leptin receptor expression in GPR82-deficient mice (<italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s019">Table S9</xref></italic>) indirectly reflects a lower body fat mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Bjorbaek1">[22]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Challenging the Phenotype by a Western Diet</title>
        <p>To test whether the phenotypical differences in lipid and glucose metabolism can be challenged by diet, one-month-old mice were kept under Western diet <italic>ad libitum</italic> for further 3 months. The body weight of both, WT and KO mice, was higher under Western diet, however, the difference in body weight between both genotypes remained at 16% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029400-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Similarly, the difference in the body fat content measured by QMR remained unchanged compared to animals under standard diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029400-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). As expected, glucose tolerance of WT mice was reduced under the Western diet. Although the glucose tolerance was also reduced in KO animals the contribution of the Western diet was not as pronounced as in WT animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029400-g003">Figure 3C/D</xref>, <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s016">Table S6</xref></italic>). The insulin concentration in serum of starved animals was significantly lower in KO animals on Western diet (<italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s016">Table S6</xref></italic>). This is consistent with the other symptoms of a metabolic syndrome found in WT mice kept under Western diet.</p>
        <p>To answer the question whether the enteral glucose uptake is disturbed in KO mice, serum glucose levels over time after oral and intraperitoneal (i.p.) application were compared. As shown in <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s006">Figure S6</xref></italic>, an improved glucose tolerance in KO mice was seen in Western diet-fed mice following i.p. glucose application. This indicates that a reduced enteral glucose uptake is not responsible for lower blood glucose levels in oGTT in KO mice. Next, insulin tolerance was tested by an i.p. insulin tolerance test (ITT). No significant changes in insulin-induced reduction of plasma glucose levels were observed between WT and KO mice under standard diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029400-g004">Figure 4A, B</xref>). However, male WT mice fed with Western diet showed significantly higher basal glucose levels compared to male KO mice and almost no changes in glucose levels after insulin application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029400-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Female KO mice under Western diet, showed significantly improved insulin sensitivity compared to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029400-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). This indicates that diet-induced insulin resistance is significantly reduced in female GPR82-deficient mice.</p>

        <p>To screen for differences in the lipid composition of different adipose tissues in KO and WT <sup>1</sup>H high-resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS) NMR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry were performed. The <sup>1</sup>H HRMAS spectra provided well separated peaks for the methyl and methylene segments from the TAG lipid chains of the fat tissue as well as a water resonance (<italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s007">Figures S7A</xref>, B</italic>). As NMR is a quantitative method, the peak integral ratios CH<sub>2</sub>/water and CH<sub>3</sub>/water (called “normalized peak integral”) provide a direct measure of the fat content of the respective tissue. Under standard diet no significant differences were observed between WT and KO mice in perigonadal, subcutaneous, and brown adipose tissue (<italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s007">Figure S7C</xref></italic>). However, fat tissues from Western diet-fed mice showed a diet-induced increase in the fat-to-water ratio, e.g. an increase in the fat content with significant differences in the subcutaneous fat tissue between WT and KO (<italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s007">Figure S7C</xref></italic>).</p>
        <p>A more detailed analysis of the composition of perigonadal, subcutaneous and brown fat tissue was performed by mass spectrometry. Specifically, the relative amounts of TAG were determined as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Schiller1">[23]</xref>. As shown in <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s008">Figure S8</xref></italic>, there are only minor differences in the TAG composition between WT and KO mice. However, the Western diet had a significant effect on the overall TAG composition in all three fat tissues. Specifically, lower molecular weight TAG, i.e. TAG with shorter fatty acyl residues and oxidized TAG species with shortened fatty acyl residues were more abundant in Western diet-fed mice. Because there were no significant differences in the TAG pattern between WT and KO mice, we interpreted the differences obtained by NMR under Western diet as an increase in the relative amount of fat compared to water in the fat tissues of WT mice.</p>

        <title>Genotype-phenotype association in humans</title>
        <p>The findings with GPR82-deficient mice encouraged us to screen for SNP-phenotype correlations with specific focus on BMI, fat content, serum glucose, and TAG in humans. We performed phenotype-genotype association studies in a Sorbs cohort that has been extensively phenotyped previously including metabolic and clinical parameters relevant for our purposes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Tonjes1">[20]</xref>. As with other populations, we found strong signatures of recent selection at the CASK locus in the Sorbs cohort (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0029400-t001">Table 1</xref>). More than 900 individuals of this cohort were genotyped at seven tagging-SNP sites spanning about 55 kb covering the genes of GPR34 and GPR82 (<italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s010">Figure S10</xref></italic>). BMI and body fat content of males showed the most significant association with two tagging SNP, rs6609159 and rs4827286, in close 5′ and 3′ proximity to the GPR82 gene, respectively and for all phenotypes tested (<italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s021">Table S11</xref></italic>). In males, SNP rs660915 and rs4827286 explained BMI differences of 0.7 and 0.74, respectively. Alleles associated with lower BMI values were linked to alleles associated with lower body fat mass. These associations were not found in female individuals. A tendency of gender specificity was also found in mice where male animals displayed more pronounced phenotypes specifically under Western diet (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029400-g003">Figure 3</xref>, <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s005">Figure S5</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s016">Table S6</xref></italic>). Interestingly, the SNP variants associated with lower BMI and body fat content have a frequency of approximately 35% in the Sorbs and are close to fixation in the Asian population (about 85%, see HapMap data). Significant correlations of two tagging SNP with the 120-min blood glucose level in oGTT were also found in female individuals when corrected for body fat content (data not shown). This indicates that the genomic CASK region also plays a role in glucose tolerance in humans. Most other parameters including those found to be significantly changed in KO mice displayed no significant association. Meta-analysis of the genotype-BMI correlations including two additional independent cohorts (Leipzig, ∼530 healthy individuals, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Bottcher1">[24]</xref> and Leipzig Heart Study, ∼1,900 individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Holdt1">[25]</xref>) supported significant associations initially observed in the Sorbs cohort (<italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s022">Table S12</xref></italic>).</p>

      <p>The X-chromosomal CASK locus is characterized by long haplotypes, a reduced genetic diversity and an excess of rare alleles in some human populations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0029400-t001">Table 1</xref>). This is compatible with the hypothesis that this locus underwent recent selection in human populations. The genomic locus contains three assigned genes: CASK, GPR34 and GPR82. To provide a link between selected and non-selected alleles, their phenotypic consequences and the selective force that may have produced the footprint of selection, information about the physiological relevance of these three genes is required.</p>
      <p>CASK is an evolutionarily conserved multidomain protein composed of an N-terminal Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-kinase domain, central PDZ and SH3 domains, and a C-terminal guanylate kinase domain. Many potential activities for CASK have been suggested, including functions in scaffolding the synapse, organizing ion channels, and regulating neuronal gene transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Mukherjee1">[26]</xref>. CASK-deficient mice die at first day after birth with neuronal/synaptic defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Atasoy1">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>GPR34 and GPR82 genes lie, in antisense orientation, in one of the introns of the CASK gene; a localization preserved for 450 million years of vertebrate evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Engemaier1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Schoneberg2">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Schulz1">[29]</xref>. Both GPCR are so-called orphan receptors with unknown agonists and physiology. To elucidate their functional relevance we generated gene-deficient mouse lines for both orphan GPCR and performed in-depth phenotypic analyses. An altered CASK function due to confounding effects of the transgenes was almost excluded in GPR34-deficient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Liebscher1">[19]</xref> and GPR82-deficient mice (see <italic><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref></italic>).</p>
      <p>GPR34-deficient mice are vital and do not display any obvious differences in morphology, histology, laboratory chemistry or behavior in a standard laboratory environment compared to their WT littermates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Liebscher1">[19]</xref>. Examinations under different immune system-challenging conditions revealed that GPR34 deficiency interferes with proper immune response and results in a reduced resistance to systemic infections.</p>
      <p>GPR82-deficient mice showed distinct phenotypes in some neuronal functions (motor activity, hot plate test) and a reduced immune response (DTH test). These tests were performed since GPR82 showed reasonable expression in brain, microglia, spleen and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (data not shown). Future studies will more specifically address the relevance of GPR82 e.g. in nociception and in immune cell function. However, the most obvious phenotype was the reduced body weight. It is widely accepted that an imbalance between food intake and energy expenditure and, subsequently the deposition of excess fatty acids into fat cells, leads to an increase in body weight and finally to consequences of obesity such as the metabolic syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Despres1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Moller1">[31]</xref>. GPR82 deficiency results in the opposite phenotype with a reduced body and fat mass, a higher glucose tolerance and lower plasma TAG levels. Low food intake, increased physical activity or a higher basal metabolic rate may account for such phenotypes. Increased activity did not account for the phenotype of GPR82-deficient mice because KO mice were less active during the dark period compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029400-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). In concert with this observation KO mice had lower total and spontaneous activities, a reduced velocity and moved a shorter distance in open field and light/dark tests compared to their WT littermates (<italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s017">Table S7</xref></italic>). However, GPR82 deficiency results in a significantly reduced food intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029400-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Because the decreased food intake lasted the entire 24-h observation period, the reduced motor activity found during the dark period cannot fully account for the reduced feeding activity.</p>
      <p>Since GPR82 is expressed in the hypothalamus (<italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s011">Table S1</xref></italic>), one can speculate that this GPCR is also involved in central appetite regulation. However, different diets had no effect on GPR82 expression and genes related to regulation of food intake showed no significant expression changes in GPR82-deficient mice. Further studies with conditional GPR82-deficient mice may determine its specific role in the hypothalamus. At this point the mechanism, how GPR82 deficiency leads to reduced food intake, remains speculative. However, all peripheral phenotypes, such as reduced fat content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029400-g001">Figure 1</xref>), lower serum TAG levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029400-g002">Figure 2</xref>), lower glucose levels in tolerance tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029400-g003">Figure 3</xref>), can simply be interpreted as secondary effects to the reduced energy uptake. This is supported by the fact that reduced fat mass in KO mice is exclusively caused by a lower TAG/water ratio (<italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s007">Figure S7</xref></italic>) and smaller adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029400-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) but not by differences in the fat composition (<italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s008">Figure S8</xref></italic>).</p>
      <p>But is the reduced body weight exclusively a result of a reduced food intake? GPR82-deficient mice present slightly elevated fT4 serum levels (<italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s015">Table S5</xref></italic>) and an increased body temperature (<italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s009">Figure S9</xref></italic>). Similarly, mice with transgenically induced hyperthyroidism (increased fT3 and fT4) displayed reduced body weight (about 10–15%) and increased body temperature (0.4°C) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Salto1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-KimSaijo1">[33]</xref>. Therefore, it cannot be completely excluded that the elevated fT4 levels, as a measure for a higher thyroid hormone activity, contribute to the phenotype at least in male KO mice. However, reduced motor activity is rather unusual in hyperthyroidism and thyroid hormone exerts negative feedback on hypothalamic type 4 melanocortin receptor expression resulting in an increase of appetite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Decherf1">[34]</xref>. It appears that the effect of GPR82 on locomotion involves additional neuronal mechanisms that need to be addressed in future studies. To further distinguish appetite from metabolic mechanisms, food clamp, and cold exposure tests or, more directly, measurements of the energy balance are helpful. No differences in the respiratory and metabolic rates were found between WT and KO mice almost excluding metabolic- and temperature-driven effects on body weight. These data support our hypothesis that reduced food intake is the main cause of lower body weight in GPR82-deficient mice.</p>
      <p>In human males, SNP rs660915 and rs4827286 showed significant association with BMI and explained BMI differences of 0.4 and 0.6, respectively, in a meta-analysis of three human cohorts (see <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s021">Tables S11</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s022">S12</xref></italic>). However, the genotype-BMI association in both Leipzig cohorts was not seen when these cohorts were analyzed separately (<italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029400.s022">Table S12</xref></italic>). The finding is not unexpected keeping in mind that the phenotypes identified in mice are the result of a complete gene deficiency. Further, the human cohorts are genetically more heterogeneous than the inbred mouse strain and epistatic effects may influence the quantity of BMI, which is per se a very convergent phenotype. Sequencing of the human GPR82-coding region of the major European haplotypes revealed no variants except of a rare silent mutation at Asp<sup>313</sup>Asp. Therefore, phenotypical differences are probably related to sequence differences at the GPR82 locus which may participate in gene regulation.</p>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>We found clear evidence that the CASK locus, which contains two orphan GPCR, GPR34 and GPR82, underwent recent selection in Asian and European populations. Although GPR82 is not required for essential vital function of vertebrates, our findings with gene-deficient mice suggest an involvement of GPR82 in food intake, glucose and lipid homeostasis and, finally, body weight. It appears that GPR82 function is required for optimal energy accumulation making this orphan GPCR a candidate gene for the ‘thrifty gene’ hypothesis. The fundamental basis of the hypothesis is that, in evolutionary history, genes (or gene variants) promoting efficient fat deposition could have been advantageous because they allowed their holders to survive periods of famine. In modern human society, such genes or their variants are disadvantageous because they promote fat deposition in preparation for a never emerging famine, resulting in widespread obesity and diabetes. Therefore, the impact of GPR82 function on energy homeostasis under specific conditions, e.g. diabetes and atherosclerosis, requires further investigation. Identification of the endogenous agonist of GPR82 is of great importance and, based on our findings with GPR82-deficient mice, the development of antagonists may be advantageous to reduce food intake and body fat.</p>
        <p>It should finally be stated that our data provide no proof that the signatures of recent selection at the CASK locus are directly related to GPR82 and its function in modulating energy and lipid metabolism. The specific functions of the two other genes, CASK and GPR34, may have also triggered the recent fixation of only one major haplotype, e.g. in the Asian population. The involvement of GPR82 and its relevance in energy homeostasis is one reasonable scenario. Further studies are needed to proof or reject hypotheses about the selective forces that produced the found footprint of selection at this genomic region.</p>

The NMR spectra show the typical aliphatic signals for fatty acids as well as for glycerol in triacylglycerides. Assignment is given according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029400-Huster1">[42]</xref>. The NMR spectra of the fat tissue from WT mice show significantly higher fat-to-water ratios than KO mice. (<bold>C</bold>) <sup>1</sup>H HRMAS NMR spectra of brown, subcutaneous and visceral (perigonadal) adipose tissue were recorded for 5 WT (open bars) and KO (filled bars) animals for each diet at a MAS frequency of 9 kHz. Spectral integrals of the CH<sub>2</sub> (at 1.30 ppm) and the CH<sub>3</sub> (0.88 ppm) signals were normalized by the integral of the water peak (at 4.65 ppm). Therefore, the water peak shows a normalized integral of unity and the CH<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>3</sub> ratio is always approximately constant.
