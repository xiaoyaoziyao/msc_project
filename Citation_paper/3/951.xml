        <p>Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents approximately 80% of total lung cancer cases. The use of non-toxic dietary phytochemicals can be considered as a chemotherapeutic strategy for the management of the NSCLC. Here, we report that grape seed proanthocyanidins (GSPs) induce apoptosis of NSCLC cells, A549 and H1299, <italic>in vitro</italic> which is mediated through increased expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax, decreased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl2 and Bcl-xl, disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, and activation of caspases 9, 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Pre-treatment of A549 and H1299 cells with the caspase-3 inhibitor (z-DEVD-fmk) significantly blocked the GSPs-induced apoptosis of these cells confirmed that GSPs-induced apoptosis is mediated through activation of caspases-3. Treatments of A549 and H1299 cells with GSPs resulted in an increase in G1 arrest. G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle is known to be controlled by cyclin dependent kinases (Cdk), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (Cdki) and cyclins. Our western blot analyses showed that GSPs-induced G1 cell cycle arrest was mediated through the increased expression of Cdki proteins (Cip1/p21 and Kip1/p27), and a simultaneous decrease in the levels of Cdk2, Cdk4, Cdk6 and cyclins. Further, administration of 50, 100 or 200 mg GSPs/kg body weight of mice by oral gavage (5 d/week) markedly inhibited the growth of <italic>s.c.</italic> A549 and H1299 lung tumor xenografts in athymic nude mice, which was associated with the induction of apoptotic cell death, increased expression of Bax, reduced expression of anti-apoptotic proteins and activation of caspase-3 in tumor xenograft cells. Based on the data obtained in animal study, human equivalent dose of GSPs was calculated, which seems affordable and attainable. Together, these results suggest that GSPs may represent a potential therapeutic agent for the non-small cell lung cancer.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States and worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-American1">[1]</xref>. One of every three cancer-related deaths is attributable to lung cancer, and the dismal 5-year survival rate of approximately 14% has shown no improvement over the past three decades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Proctor1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Jemal1">[3]</xref>. Small-cell lung cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) account for 90% of all lung cancers. NSCLC represents approximately 80% of all types of lung cancer and includes squamous cell carcinomas, adenocarcinomas, and large-cell carcinomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Maziak1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Hoffman1">[5]</xref>. Although a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy can improve survival of the patients, most patients die of disease progression, often resulting from acquired or intrinsic resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Ferrigno1">[6]</xref>. Therefore, the exploration and development of more effective therapeutic agents and therapies that can target the molecules associated with tumor growth and apoptosis resistance will lead to improved outcomes in patients with lung cancer.</p>
      <p>Natural plant products offer promising new options for the development of more effective chemotherapeutic strategies for cancers of various organs. Grape seed proanthocyanidins (GSPs) are promising phytochemicals that have anti-inflammatory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-MaffeiFacino1">[7]</xref> and anti-oxidant properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Bagchi1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Mittal1">[10]</xref>, and appear to exhibit minimal toxicity in laboratory animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Sharma1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Mittal1">[10]</xref>. GSPs are readily extracted from grape-seeds, a by-product of grape juice and wine industries, and are a mixture of several polyphenolic components, which constitute dimers, trimers, tetramers, and oligomers/polymers of monomeric catechins and/or (-)-epicatechins, as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Sharma1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Mittal1">[10]</xref>. We believe that at least some of the constituents present in GSPs act synergistically and may provide better chemotherapeutic effects than a single constituent.</p>
      <p>Previously, we have shown that dietary supplementation of GSPs with AIN76A control diet resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the growth of A549 and H1299 NSCLC tumor xenograft in athymic nude mice, and the growth inhibitory effect of GSPs on the NSCLC xenograft tumors was associated with the enhancement of the levels of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 and anti-angiogenic effects in the tumor microenvironments (11). In another study, we also have reported that GSPs inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis of NSCLC cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor xenografts, which was associated with their inhibitory effects on the cyclooxygenase-2 expression and production of its prostaglandin metabolite, PGE<sub>2</sub> (12). In contrast, a significant inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in normal human bronchial epithelial cells after GSPs treatment under identical conditions was not observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Akhtar1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Sharma2">[12]</xref>. In spite of anti-carcinogenic effects of GSPs on NSCLC cells, a precise mechanism of the inhibitory effect on the NSCLC cell growth and apoptosis by GSPs is not well understood. In the present communication, we conducted a comprehensive investigation on the mechanism responsible for the inhibition of lung cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis using A549 and H1299 cell lines as an <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture model and <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor xenograft model. To study the <italic>in vivo</italic> effect of GSPs on tumor xenograft growth, GSPs was given to mice by oral gavage 5 days/week. We report that GSPs-induced apoptotic cell death of NSCLC cells is mediated through modulations in the expression levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase-3 activation pathways. GSPs also checked the deregulated cell cycle progression and associated regulatory proteins in NSCLC cells. Thus our studies provide insight into the mechanism by which GSPs induce apoptosis in these cells. Additionally, our results provide a convincing rationale for the pharmacological activity of GSPs against human non-small cell lung cancer cells.</p>

        <title>Cell culture and cell lines</title>
        <p>Human non-small cell lung carcinoma cell lines, A549 and H1299, and normal human bronchial epithelial cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The A549 and H1299 cell lines were cultured as monolayers in Ham's F-12 and RPMI 1640 culture medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 100 µg/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin and maintained in an incubator with a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C. The GSPs were dissolved in a small amount of dimethylsulfoxide [DMSO, maximum concentration, 0.1% (v/v)], which was then added to complete cell culture medium prior to addition to subconfluent cells (60–70% confluent). Cells treated with vehicle only (DMSO, 0.1% in media) served as control.</p>

        <p>The activity of caspase-3 in cell lysates was measured using the colorimetric protease assay ApoTarget Kit (BioSource International, Inc., CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, A549 or H1299 cells were treated with GSPs (20, 40, 60 and 80 µg/mL) for 48 h. Thereafter, the cells were harvested using short trypsinization and cell lysates prepared following the manufacturer's protocol. Samples of the cell lysates (100 µg protein per sample) were mixed with reaction buffer and 200 µmol/L substrate (DEVD-pNA for caspase-3) and incubated for 3 h at 37°C in the dark. The absorbance was then measured at 405 nm and the sample readings calculated by subtracting the absorbance of blank samples.</p>

        <title>DNA cell cycle analysis</title>
        <p>Sub-confluent cells (50–60%) were treated with varying concentrations of GSPs in complete medium for 48 h. The cells were then harvested, washed with cold PBS, and processed for cell cycle analysis, as detailed previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Mantena1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Mantena2">[14]</xref>. Briefly, the cells (1×10<sup>5</sup>) were re-suspended in 50 µL cold PBS to which 450 µL cold methanol was added and the cells were then incubated for 1 h at 4°C. The cells were centrifuged at 1,100 rpm for 5 minutes; the pellet was washed with cold PBS, re-suspended in 500 µL PBS, and incubated with 5 µL RNase (20 µg/mL final concentration) for 30 minutes. The cells were incubated with propidium iodide (50 µg/mL) on ice for 1 h in the dark. The cell cycle distribution of the cells was then determined using FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) equipped with CellQuest 3.3 software in the Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) machine at the Core Facility of the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center.</p>

        <p>Following treatment of A549 and H1299 cells with GSPs, the cells were harvested, washed with cold PBS and lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors, as detailed previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Sharma2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Mantena1">[13]</xref>. For immunoblotting of cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, Smac/DIABLO and Cox IV, mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were prepared from the cells and the proteins were resolved on 10% Tris-Glycine gels and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking the non-specific binding sites, the membrane was incubated with the desired primary antibody at 4°C overnight. The membrane was then incubated with appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the immunoreactive bands were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence reagents. Each membrane was stripped and re-probed with anti-β-actin antibody to ensure equal protein loading.</p>
        <p>For Cdk inhibitor (Cdki)-Cdk binding assay, A549 cells were treated with vehicle or 60 µg/mL GSPs for 48 h, washed with ice-cold PBS, and whole cell lysates prepared as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Mantena1">[13]</xref>. Aliquots containing 200 µg of protein were cleared with protein A/G-plus agarose beads (Santa Cruz, CA). Cip1/p21 and Kip1/p27 proteins were immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates using specific antibodies after incubation for 8 h followed by the addition of protein A/G-plus agarose beads (50 µL, Santa Cruz, CA) and continued incubation overnight at 4°C. Immunoprecipitates were washed, and subsequently subjected to western blot analysis using Tris-Glycine gels followed by immunoblotting using Cdk2, Cdk4 and Cdk6 antibodies.</p>

        <title>Assay for mitochondrial membrane potential</title>
        <p>The change in the mitochondrial membrane potential in lung cancer cells after treatment with GSPs was determined by flow cytometry using the fluorescent lipophilic cationic probe JC-1 (5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolcarbocyanine iodide) Detection Kit following the instructions of the manufacturer, and as described by us previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Mantena1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Mantena2">[14]</xref>. JC-1 accumulates selectively within intact mitochondria to form multimer J-aggregates emitting fluorescence light at 590 nm. The monomeric form emits light at 527 nm after excitation at 490 nm. Thus, the color of the dye changes from orange to green, depending on the mitochondrial membrane potential, and can be analyzed by FACS with green fluorescence in channel 1 (FL1) and orange emission in channel 2 (FL2).</p>

        <title>Animals and tumor xenograft study</title>
        <p>Female athymic nude mice (4–5 weeks-old) were purchased from National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD), housed in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines, and provided with sterilized AIN76A diet and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. All mice were maintained under standard conditions of a 12-h dark/12-h light cycle, a temperature of 24±2°C, and relative humidity of 50±10%. The animal protocol used in this study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and approved Animal Protocol Number is: 101109267.</p>
        <p>To determine the <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy of GSPs against human lung cancer tumor xenograft growth, exponentially growing A549 and H1299 cells (2×10<sup>6</sup>) were mixed at a 1∶1 ratio with Matrigel (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA), and a 100 µL suspension containing 2×10<sup>6</sup> cells was injected s.c. in the right flank of each mouse. After 24 h, mice were randomly divided in four groups (n = 10). Experimental animals were treated by oral gavage with 50, 100 or 200 mg GSPs/kg body weight/day in 100 µL of PBS five-days a week (Monday through Friday) beginning one day after tumor cell implantation. Control mice received an equal volume of PBS. The experiment was terminated 58 days after tumor cell inoculation. Tumor growth was monitored 2-times per week. Body weight/mouse and diet consumption/mouse were recorded regularly throughout the experiment. Animals were also monitored if they become ill or suffering (lack normal grooming and avoidance behaviors) during the entire experiment period. At the termination of the experiment, the whole tumor mass was harvested, weighed, and a part of the tumor was used for the preparation of tumor lysates to analyze the expression levels of different proteins of interest and remaining part was used for immunohistochemical analysis.</p>

        <p>Five-µm thick tumor sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated in a graded series of alcohols. Following rehydration, an antigen retrieval process was performed by placing the slides in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0 at 95°C for 20 minutes followed by 20-minutes cooling. The sections were washed in PBS and non-specific binding sites were blocked with 1% BSA with 2% goat serum in PBS prior to incubation with anti-PCNA antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, the sections were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody for 45 min followed by HRP-conjugated streptavidin, washing in PBS, incubation with diaminobenzidine substrate, and counterstaining with hematoxylin. Apoptotic cell death in tumor tissues was detected using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays. The numbers of PCNA-positive and TUNEL-positive cells were detected and counted using a light microscope. The results are presented as the number of positive cells x 100/total number of cells.</p>

        <p>Periodic measurement of the tumor xenograft volume indicated that the treatment with GSPs, particularly with the doses of 100 and 200 mg GSPs/kg body weight, resulted in reduced growth of both the A549 and H1299 lung cancer xenografts throughout the duration of the experiment. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027444-g006">Figure 6B</xref> (left panel), the GSPs-induced inhibition of A549 xenograft tumor volume was 51% in mice administered GSPs at a concentration of 100 mg/kg body weight and 75% (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) in the mice administered GSPs at a concentration of 200 mg/kg body weight.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Chemotherapy offers a promising strategy for control of cancer. Several phytochemicals including dietary plant products have been shown to have anti-carcinogenic properties. GSPs represent one such phytochemicals and have been shown to have anti-carcinogenic activity in different organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Mittal1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Sharma2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Ye1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Mantena3">[26]</xref>. We have shown previously that long-term dietary feeding of GSPs supplemented with AIN76A control diet of laboratory animals does not show apparent signs of toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Mittal1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Akhtar1">[11]</xref>. In the present study, we further verify that long-term administration of GSPs by oral gavage also does not induce any visible sign of toxicity in mice. Similarly, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies indicate that GSPs exhibit anti-proliferation or cytotoxic effects against tumor cells, but do not exhibit toxic effects on the growth and viability of normal (non-neoplastic) cells in culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Akhtar1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Sharma2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Ye1">[25]</xref>. Previously we have shown that treatment of both A549 and H1299 human non-small cell lung cancer cells with GSPs resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis, while these effects of GSPs were not observed in normal human bronchial epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Akhtar1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Sharma2">[12]</xref>. Induction of apoptosis is considered as one of the possible mechanisms of inhibition of cancer development, and many therapeutic agents have been shown to act through the induction of apoptosis in their inhibition or blockade of the carcinogenic process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Bursch1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Wright1">[29]</xref>. Some evidence indicates that apoptosis may represent a protective mechanism against neoplastic development by eliminating genetically damaged cells or those cells that have improperly been induced to proliferate by factors such as carcinogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Barry1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Hickman1">[31]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Experimental evidence suggests that apoptosis can be mediated by several different pathways and that there are numerous regulatory molecules associated with these pathways. The proteins of the Bcl-2 family include both pro- and anti-apoptotic members that elicit opposing effects on mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Reed1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-McCurrach1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Yin1">[33]</xref>. Enhancement of pro-apoptotic Bax over Bcl-2 proteins can enhance the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane, which in turn results in the release of apoptogenic factors. Repression of anti-apoptotic members of this family, including Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, preserves the integrity of the mitochondria. This blocks the release of soluble inter-membrane factors such as cytochrome <italic>c</italic> that activate the effectors of apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Donovan1">[34]</xref>. In this study, we found that treatment of the NSCLC cells with GSPs up-regulate the pro-apoptotic Bax protein and down-regulate the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl and that this occurs in both A549 and H1299 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027444-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The alteration in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio is critical for apoptosis and causes the release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO from mitochondria into the cytosol after the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Reed1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Hockenbery1">[16]</xref>. Cytosolic cytochrome c can bind to Apaf-1 and activate caspase-9 in the apoptosomes in response to diverse inducers of cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Chao1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Kluck1">[35]</xref>. Activation of caspase-9 leads to the activation of caspase-3 which is one of the key-mediators of apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Reed1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Kluck1">[35]</xref>. GSPs also result in an increase in the release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO in cytosols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027444-g002">Figure 2</xref>), activation of caspase-9 and finally an increase in the activation or cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027444-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The involvement of GSPs-induced increase in activation of caspase-3 and its effect on apoptosis was further confirmed by measuring its activity and induction of apoptotic cell death by cell death detection ELISA. The blockade of GSPs-induced apoptosis in A549 and H1299 cells by the addition of the caspase-3 inhibitor (z-DEVD-fmk) confirmed the role of activated caspase-3 in the GSPs-induced apoptosis.</p>
      <p>It has been recognized that control of cell cycle progression in cancer cells is an effective strategy to inhibit tumor growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Pavletich1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Grana1">[36]</xref> as the molecular analyses of human cancers have revealed that cell cycle regulators are frequently deregulated in most of the common malignancies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Kastan1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Molinari1">[38]</xref>. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> data demonstrate that treatment of A549 and H1299 cells with GSPs induces G1 phase arrest of cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027444-g004">Figure 4</xref>) indicating that one of the mechanisms by which GSPs inhibit the proliferation of lung cancer cells is inhibition of cell cycle progression. Our studies demonstrate a marked decrease in the expressions of cyclins D1, D2 and E, and Cdk2, Cdk4 and Cdk6 in both A549 and H1299 cells dose-dependently on GSPs treatment suggests the disruption of the uncontrolled cell cycle progression of human NSCLC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027444-g005">Figure 5</xref>) and that the GSPs-induced G1 arrest is mediated through the up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory proteins, Cip1/p21 and Kip1/p27, which enhances the formation of heterotrimeric complexes with the G1/S Cdks and cyclins thereby resulting in inhibition of their activity.</p>
      <p>Uncontrolled cell division depends on the activation of cyclins, which bind to Cdk to induce cell cycle progression towards S phase. Cdk kinase activity is one of the major causes of cancer progression, and their functions are tightly regulated by Cdki, such as, Cip1/p21 and Kip1/p27 proteins. Cip1/p21 is a universal inhibitor of Cdk(s) and Kip1/p27 is commonly up-regulated in response to anti-proliferative signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Toyoshima1">[39]</xref>. The increased expression of G1 cyclins in cancer cells provides them an uncontrolled growth advantage because most of these cells either lack Cdki, harbor nonfunctional Cdki, or Cdki expression is not at a sufficient level to control Cdk-cyclin activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Molinari1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-Hunter1">[40]</xref>. Consistent with these reports, the increased expressions of Cdkis together with decreased expression of cyclins and Cdks on the GSPs treatment to A549 and H1299 cells suggest that GSPs might be effective as a chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancers.</p>
      <p>Our <italic>in vivo</italic> study provides further evidence that administration of GSPs by gavage inhibits the growth of both A549 and H1299 tumor xenografts by inducing cell death and without any apparent sign of toxicity in athymic nude mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027444-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027444-g007">7</xref>). Further, consistent with the findings in cell culture model, an increase in the levels of pro-apoptotic protein Bax, and cleaved caspase-9, caspase-3 and PARP proteins were also observed in the tumors of GSPs-treated group compared to the control mice which were not given GSPs by gavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027444-g007">Figure 7</xref>). These results also indicate the inhibition of growth of lung tumor xenograft through increased apoptosis of tumor cells and inhibition of tumor cell proliferation in GSPs-treated mice.</p>
      <p>It is reasonable to consider whether the chemotherapeutic effect of GSPs examined in an animal model can be translated in human system. For appropriate conversion of the doses of chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic agent from animal studies to humans, the body surface area normalization method has been recommended <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027444-ReaganShaw1">[41]</xref>. In the present study, maximum dose of GSPs by oral gavage was given 200 mg/kg body weight of the mouse. Based on this information, the human equivalent dose of GSPs was calculated using the following formula:</p>
      <p>
        <disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0027444.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>
      </p>
      <p>(<italic>Km</italic> factor for mouse = 3; <italic>Km</italic> factor for adult human = 37).</p>
      <p>If, the body weight of a normal standard person is considered to be 70 Kg, then 1.13 g GSPs will be required for a healthy person/day to produce same level of anti-lung carcinogenic effects as observed in mice, which seems reasonable, affordable and attainable.</p>
      <p>In summary, the novelty of this study lies in the analysis of chemotherapeutic effects of GSPs on additional new molecular targets of NSCLC cells using both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models. This detailed and systematic study revealed that GSPs induce apoptosis of human non-small cell lung cancer cells by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, which was not reported earlier in this model. The present findings provide pre-clinical data suggesting that grape seed proanthocyanidins have the potential to be developed as a pharmacologically safe agent either alone or in combination with other drugs for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancers in humans.</p>
