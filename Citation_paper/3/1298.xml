      <abstract>
        <p>The human brain is composed of two broadly symmetric cerebral hemispheres, with an abundance of reciprocal anatomical connections between homotopic locations. However, to date, studies of hemispheric symmetries have not identified correspondency precisely due to variable cortical folding patterns. Here we present a method to establish accurate correspondency using position on the unfolded cortical surface relative to gyral and sulcal landmarks. The landmark method is shown to outperform the method of reversing standard volume coordinates, and it is used to quantify the functional symmetry in resting fMRI data throughout the cortex. Resting brain activity was found to be maximally correlated with locations less than 1 cm away on the cortical surface from the corresponding anatomical location in nearly half of the cortex. While select locations exhibited asymmetric patterns, precise symmetric relationships were found to be the norm, with fine-grained symmetric functional maps demonstrated in motor, occipital, and inferior frontal cortex.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The human brain is composed of two grossly symmetric cerebral hemispheres that are interconnected by white matter tracts, mainly through the corpus callosum, as well as through the anterior and posterior commissures. At a large spatial scale, the pattern of cortical folding in terms of gyri and sulci appears largely symmetric. This symmetry is echoed at the more detailed scale of cell-to-cell synaptic connections and cortical maps, with anatomical studies in animals revealing an abundance of symmetric connections across corresponding locations in the two hemispheres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Hedreen1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Jacobson1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Manzoni1">[3]</xref>. In contrast to this seeming symmetric anatomical organization, there are striking and well-known examples of cognitive functions in humans that are strongly lateralized to one hemisphere, such as language to the left hemisphere and visuospatial and attentional abilities that are more lateralized to the right hemisphere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Damasio1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Mesulam1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-ThiebautdeSchotten1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Turken1">[7]</xref>. These joint observations of cortical symmetry and lateralization pose a basic puzzle for our understanding of large-scale brain organization: how does functional lateralization emerge in the context of gross anatomical symmetry?</p>
      <p>In humans, it is not possible to directly measure anatomical connections through the standard anatomical tracer techniques that are used in animals. Instead, researchers commonly use noninvasive methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess structural and functional relationships between pairs of brain locations, using techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Asato1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Skudlarski1">[9]</xref> to estimate the presence of white-matter tracts, and the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) to estimate functional correlations among task-evoked or resting voxel timeseries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Fox1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Friston1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Binder1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Biswal1">[13]</xref>. Indeed, the last decade has seen an explosion of studies that measure patterns of temporally covarying BOLD activity while subjects are at rest in order to assess functional relationships in large-scale brain networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Binder1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Biswal2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Cherkassky1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Greicius1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Greicius2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Mezer1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Noonan1">[19]</xref>, . One of the most common observations is that the timeseries from a seed region-of-interest (ROI) in one hemisphere is strongly correlated with the timeseries in the corresponding location in the opposite hemisphere in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Anderson1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Dickstein1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Fornito1">[24]</xref> and in monkeys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Leopold1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Scholvinck1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Shmuel1">[27]</xref>. In the first such study, Biswal et al. observed that a seed timeseries extracted from the left motor cortex was highly correlated with the same relative location in the right motor cortex during rest, as well as with other motor-related regions (e.g. supplementary motor area), that were identified during a separate finger-tapping localizer scan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Biswal1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Biswal2">[14]</xref>. This finding has been replicated many times in motor cortex as well as in a variety of other brain regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Fox1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Smith1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Leopold1">[25]</xref>. More recent studies have attempted to characterize the generality of these cross-hemispheric correlations over the whole brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Salvador1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Salvador2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Stark1">[30]</xref>, as well as to clarify the spatial precision of the cross-hemispheric maps in somatotopic cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-vandenHeuvel1">[31]</xref>. Studies evaluating the complementary issue of cross-hemispheric asymmetries have also been carried out <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Anderson2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Ke1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Liu1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Tomasi1">[35]</xref>. However, one major difficulty facing all of these studies is that it is difficult to be precise about exactly which two points are corresponding in the two hemispheres. Studies that have attempted to quantify symmetries/asymmetries have simply “flipped” the <italic>x</italic>-coordinate value within standard anatomical space, assuming that this estimate will be adequate. However, this approach is at the mercy of what may be quite striking variations in the detailed gyral folding patterns in the two hemispheres, some of which may be systematic across subjects, as well as differences in overall brain shape from subject to subject and other anatomical differences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Derrfuss1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Toga1">[37]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A better solution is to utilize a surface-based representation of the cortical surface, aligned across subjects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Argall1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Saad1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Saad2">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-VanEssen1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-VanEssen2">[42]</xref>. Correspondence between the two hemispheres can then be estimated relative to cortical landmarks in the two hemispheres. In the current paper, anatomically corresponding locations are defined relative to a large number of gyral and sulcal landmarks, allowing precise estimates of homotopic locations throughout the entire cortex. We first identify corresponding locations throughout both hemispheres and quantify the improved precision over the standard flipping method. We then quantify the agreement of anatomical correspondences with the physiological or “functional” correspondences, defined here as the peak value of the cross-hemispheric resting-state (RS) correlation maps. Finally, we examine the fine-grained nature of the cross-hemispheric correlation maps in well-known cortical maps, such as somatotopic and retinotopic cortex, as well as in areas without known maps.</p>

        <title>MRI Acquisition</title>
        <p>During MRI scan sessions, subjects were instructed to clear their minds and fixate on a black cross in the center of the screen. All MR image data were collected using a GE 3T scanner with 8-channel head coil array. RS-fMRI time series were acquired using a T2*-weighted gradient echo pulse sequence with high spatial resolution (1.7×1.7×3.0 mm<sup>3</sup>, TR = 3.5 s, TE = 27 ms, flip angle = 90°) accelerated by the SENSE method. Each of the RS-fMRI scans lasted for 490 s or 140 volumes. EPI data passed the sudden motion detection of AFNI program ‘afni_proc.py’ at the threshold level 0.3 mm for Euclidean L2 norm of motion displacement during each TR interval (see also Power et al., 2012). A respiration belt was used to measure respiration volume and a pulse oximeter to monitor heart rhythm. Belt diameter and pulse oximeter readings were sampled at 50 Hz, with recording onset triggered by the scanner’s slice-selection trigger pulse. For each subject, an MPRAGE sequence was used to acquire two high-resolution (0.9×0.9×1.2 mm<sup>3</sup>) T1-weighted anatomical images.</p>

Additional 1-TR delayed regressors of the nuisance variables were also included in order to remove any additional delayed effects of noise sources.

        <title>Landmark-Based Correspondence</title>
        <p>While the number of nodes in the standardized left and right hemisphere surfaces is the same, identical node indices in the two hemispheres do not represent anatomically homologous locations. Corresponding cortical nodes in the two hemispheres were identified by finding nodes with the most similar pattern of relative distances from within-hemisphere gyral/sulcal landmarks. We assigned to each cortical node a 74-dimensional label vector containing the distances along the surface (geodesic) from that node to the centroid of each of the 74 parcellated cortical regions provided by FreeSurfer, based on gyral boundaries, to redefine locations on the cortical surfaces instead of the Cartesian coordinate (<italic>x, y, z</italic>) as showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g001">Figure 1A:</xref><disp-formula id="pone.0048847.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0048847.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0048847.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the label vector to define the position of a node in the hemisphere; <italic>δ<sub>j</sub></italic> is the geodesic distance along the cortical surface between the node and the centroid of <italic>j</italic>-th FreeSurfer cortical region (i.e. the length of the shortest path along the surface between the points), which is calculated on the standardized smooth white matter surfaces by SUMA’s <italic>SurfDist</italic> program. The “anatomical” correspondence of a cortical node can be determined by finding the node in the opposite hemisphere whose label vector has the largest Pearson correlation (ρ) with the seed node’s label vector. Therefore, the anatomical correspondence of a node is the node on the contralateral hemisphere with the most similar label vector as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g001">Figure 1B</xref>.</p>

        <title>Functional Correspondence</title>
        <p>In a typical RS functional connectivity analysis, a seed’s time series from a particular location is correlated with the remaining time series in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Biswal1">[13]</xref>. Correlations between the seed and other locations are used as an indication of functional connectedness, which can be represented as a cross-correlation matrix among the time series of every node in a brain model. In order to avoid aliasing of cerebrospinal fluid and white matter signals into the grey matter signal estimates, the residual time series from the regression model were mapped onto cortical surfaces using an average kernel with ten sampling points evenly distributed along a line centered between smooth white matter and pial surfaces and extending 80% of the thickness between corresponding nodes on the two surfaces. The mapped time series were smoothed with a heat kernel that resulted in 8 mm full-width-at-half-maximum noise spatial correlation structure on the white matter surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Chung1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Jo2">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Jo3">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Jo4">[52]</xref>. For each subject, we calculated the full cross-correlation matrix for the time series of every node on both hemispheres, which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g001">Figure 1C</xref>. These individual correlation matrices were then averaged to make a group correlation matrix reflecting common characteristics of connectivity. For correlation analysis, each node served as both a seed and target location. For determining functional connectivity across hemispheres, a node in one hemisphere is the seed, and all nodes in the contralateral hemisphere are its targets as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g001">Figure 1D</xref>. Node colors in the RH target show correlation coefficients (ρ) with a seed <italic>n</italic> of the LH. The functional correspondence (FC) of LH seed <italic>n</italic> is defined here as the contralateral target node whose time series is maximally correlated to that of the seed (node <italic>m</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). It is important to note that the term functional “correspondence” is used more loosely here than for the anatomical correspondence (AC), as there is no in-principle constraint that the FC be near the AC. Indeed, it could be located far away from the homotopic cortical position of the seed node.</p>

        <title>Quantification of Functional Correspondence Across Hemispheres</title>
        <p>Each seed node gets both anatomical correspondences and functional correspondences on the contralateral hemispheres illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g003">Figure 3</xref>. We define the geodesic distance between anatomical and functional correspondences as the Anatomy-to-Functional Correspondence Distance (AFCD) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). A small AFCD indicates that RS fluctuations at one anatomical location have their maximal correlation near the corresponding location in the contralateral hemisphere. The AFCDs are computed for all seed nodes of both hemispheres. In principle, large values of AFCD do not necessarily indicate an asymmetric pattern across the two hemispheres, since two anatomical correspondences can yield distant functional correspondences that are anatomical correspondences of each other. The symmetric or asymmetric nature of the patterns can be described by one quantity called the Functional Asymmetry Distance (FAD), defined as the distance between the functional correspondences of 2 anatomically corresponding points when projected to same hemisphere through the anatomical mapping (right side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).</p>

        <title>Assessing Discrepancies between Landmark-Based Correspondence and Coordinate Flipping</title>
        <p>Given that the more standard method of determining corresponding points in the two hemispheres involves the simple operation of “flipping” (i.e. reversing) the sign of the <italic>x</italic>-coordinate in standard anatomical space, it is important to estimate the relative benefit of the landmark-based method. In order to quantify this benefit, maps of the anatomical correspondences determined through the landmark-based method were converted back to volume space using the mapping of the N27 surface template to its corresponding Talairach template in the volume (TT_N27 brain). For each grey matter seed voxel in the TT_N27 brain, the Euclidean distance in volume space was then calculated between the volume-converted anatomical correspondence in the opposite hemisphere and the correspondence expected by flipping of the <italic>x</italic>-coordinate (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). This set of distances for the TT_N27 brain could then be graphically rendered either in the volume or back on the N27 surface template for ease of viewing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g002">Figure 2E</xref>).</p>

        <title>Anatomical Correspondences through Cortical Landmarks Versus Coordinate Flipping</title>
        <p>Using the landmark-based correspondence method for cortical surfaces (shown graphically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g001">Figure 1</xref>), we determined anatomically corresponding cortical locations between the hemispheres. Correspondences were found by comparing distances on the cortical surface between each vertex and the centroids of automatically segmented regions of interest from FreeSurfer from the same hemisphere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Fischl1">[44]</xref>. Pairs of vertices in the two hemispheres with the most similar pattern of relative distances are defined here as “anatomical correspondences”. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, each vertex in the left hemisphere is shown with a unique color, and its anatomical correspondence in the right hemisphere is given the same color. Note the nicely symmetric color map across the two hemispheres, indicating a well-ordered relationship. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g002">Figure 2B</xref> shows 3 single vertices in the left hemisphere sampled from the left inferior frontal gyrus, the left inferior parietal cortex, and the left middle temporal gyrus, along with their anatomical correspondences in the right hemisphere. Note the good agreement of the left and right hemisphere points relative to the gyral/sulcal landmarks in each case, shown on the inflated cortical surface in two shades of gray (dark gray = sulcus, light gray = gyrus). Thus, at the scope of the whole-brain, the landmark-based correspondence method operates as expected, with single points paired at the same relative position to gyral/sulcal boundaries.</p>
        <p>Given the prevalence of the coordinate flipping method and its ease of implementation, it is important to quantify the relative benefit of finding correspondence through cortical landmarks. In order to evaluate this, the surface-based representations of the anatomical correspondences were translated back into standard volume space for the TT_N27 brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Holmes1">[47]</xref>, and the Euclidean distance was calculated between the anatomical correspondence of each gray matter voxel and its correspondence calculated through flipping the <italic>x</italic>-coordinate value (i.e. multiplying by -1). Given the poor spatial agreement of the grey matter ribbon in the two hemispheres (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), it is perhaps not surprising that the discrepancies between the two methods can be quite large, with nearly 80% of anatomical correspondences residing more than 5 mm away from the expected flipping locations (summarized over voxels in both hemispheres in the histogram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Indeed, flipping can commonly lead to estimated correspondences that are outside grey matter, either in white matter of the opposite hemisphere or outside the brain. For ease of viewing, the distances between the two methods in the volume have been rendered back onto the surface in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g002">Figure 2E</xref>. Problem spots for the flipping method (in which the discrepancies are 15 mm or more, shown in red) are notable in the lateral frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices, where cortical folding can be somewhat irregular and idiosyncratic for a given subject. The benefits of finding hemispheric correspondence through cortical landmarks are particularly clear in these locations, although measurable benefits are present throughout the cortex. Since extensive spatial smoothing is often applied in volume-based coordinate flipping studies in order to improve interhemispheric correspondences, a further benefit of the surface-based landmark approach is that it may permit a reduction in the extent of spatial smoothing necessary for good correspondence, thereby enhancing the effective spatial resolution of the data.</p>

        <title>Quantifying Symmetry between Anatomical and Functional Correspondences Across Hemispheres</title>
        <p>After finding anatomical correspondences for the two hemispheres, we then determined the functional correspondences across hemispheres by finding the vertex exhibiting the maximal cross-hemispheric correlation for each seed vertex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Throughout most of the cortex, functional correspondences are near their anatomical correspondences in the contralateral hemisphere, indicated by a similar color layout for seed and target hemispheres. Neighboring seed nodes occasionally share the same precise functional correspondence in the contralateral hemisphere, leaving some target nodes without any corresponding seed (e.g. note the territories of the cingulate sulcus and posterior superior temporal sulcus in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Discrepant colors in the seed maps of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g003">Figure 3</xref> indicate that the functional correspondence in the contralateral target hemisphere is not near the anatomical correspondence, with the precise color indicating the position of the functional correspondence in the target hemisphere (target color maps match those for the same vertex positions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>
        <p>The distance along the cortical surface between the anatomical and functional correspondences shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g003">3</xref> is defined as the Anatomy-to-Functional-Correspondence Distance (AFCD) (graphically defined on the left side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). AFCD (in mm) for each vertex is shown using color in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g004">Figure 4B</xref> (top: left seeds, bottom: right seeds), with corresponding histograms shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g004">Figure 4C</xref>. Perhaps the most notable finding is that the majority of the brain has relatively small AFCDs, shown in blue colors, with 80% of vertices having a distance of less than 2 cm between anatomical and functional correspondences, indicating cross-hemispheric symmetry in resting-state correlation maps. Note that this distance should <italic>not</italic> be compared to the Euclidean distances shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, since AFCD is a measure of the spatial correspondence between an anatomical and a physiological quantity rather than a measure of the mismatch of two anatomical coordinate systems. Distances calculated along the contour of the cortical surface will also tend to be larger than those calculated in the volume, since the latter ignore the folding in the cortical surface. In a few select locations (e.g. the lateral anterior temporal cortex), the AFCDs can be much larger, yielding distances of more than 21 cm along the surface (shown in red). However, large values of AFCD do not necessarily indicate an asymmetric pattern across the two hemispheres. This is because two seed vertices that are anatomical correspondences of one another might yield functional correspondences that are far away from the seed locations, yet are themselves anatomical correspondences (i.e. they fall at anatomically symmetrical positions, forming a “criss-cross” pattern when viewed from above). In order to address this issue, the Functional Asymmetry Distance (FAD) instead calculates the discrepancy between resulting functional correspondences, using the map of anatomical correspondences to project both functional correspondences to the same hemisphere (see right side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, the FAD values look very similar to the AFCD values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, suggesting vertices with high values of AFCD do indeed correspond to asymmetric patterns.</p>
        <p>The potentially asymmetric functional correspondence patterns detected using the FAD were then investigated in more detail by organizing them into separate clusters of contiguous vertices with similar values of FAD (see ROI key in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g005">Figure 5</xref>). For the clustering, the seed regions were thresholded above FAD = 100 mm (upper 5% of values), excluding small clusters with fewer than 20 vertices (∼ 50 mm<sup>2</sup> area). Maps of the functional correspondences for two example clusters in the lateral anterior temporal cortex and the supplementary motor cortex are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>, respectively. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, seeds in the left anterior temporal cortex have most of their functional correspondences in the symmetric locations in the right hemisphere, as well as in the posterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex. In contrast, seeds in the right anterior temporal lobe have relatively more functional correspondences in the left medial frontal cortex, with a good number still residing in the left anterior temporal cortex and a few in the left posterior cingulate. These various locations constitute language- and social-related areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Turken1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Binder2">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Binder3">[54]</xref> and/or subcomponents of the well-studied “default” network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Binder1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Raichle1">[20]</xref>. In order to gain a more complete picture of the patterns of correlation for these vertices, we also calculated the average correlation map for these seed locations within and across hemispheres rather than simply relying on the location of maximum correlation, shown to the right of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g005">Figure 5A</xref>. Rather than serving as an example of a pronounced asymmetric pattern of correlation, the average correlation maps suggest quantitative and not qualitative differences in the maps between hemispheres, with the position of maximum cross-hemispheric correlation occurring in one of the other areas making up the large-scale brain network. A similar example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, but for supplementary (medial) motor and primary (lateral) motor areas, with the right hemisphere seeds eliciting functional correspondences in the left lateral motor cortex (see Figures S2 and S3 for the remaining ROIs). In both cases, the average correlation maps appear much more symmetrical than the functional correspondences (based on the maximum correlation) would indicate. Consistent with this, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g005">Figure 5C</xref> shows that the graded cross-hemispheric correlation map elicited by each vertex and its anatomical correspondence in the other hemisphere are themselves positively correlated with one another throughout the cortex, even for vertices with high FAD. Differences in the temporal signal-to-noise ratios (tSNR) across hemispheres were assessed, but they failed to account for the locations of high FAD (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048847.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>

        <title>Functional Correspondences can be Organized into Precise and Symmetric Spatial Maps</title>
        <p>While some vertices exhibit high AFCD and FAD values, in which the maximum correlation and the average correlation can yield different pictures about the symmetric organization of cross-hemispheric correlation maps, the majority of vertices yield low AFCD/FAD values. This suggested that precise maps of the maximum cross-hemispheric correlation (i.e. functional correspondence) may exist throughout much of the cortex. We examined the fine-grained nature of functional correspondence maps in two regions of cortex with well-known functional maps, somatosensory/motor cortex (in the territory of the central sulcus) and early visual cortex (in the territory of the calcarine sulcus), as well as in an area with no known fine-grained map, the inferior frontal gyrus. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g006">Figure 6</xref>, using color to represent spatial position, shows that precise, symmetric functional correspondence maps are present in all three brain regions. A variety of the other FreeSurfer ROIs used to calculate anatomical correspondences also exhibit low average FAD values (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048847.s005">Table S1</xref> for all ROIs used). Taken together, these results indicate the widespread presence of fine-grained cross-hemispheric correlation maps.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the current paper, we have presented a method for finding corresponding locations in the two cerebral hemispheres using gyral/sulcal landmarks. When examining single vertices on the cortical surface, this approach correctly identifies anatomical correspondences in the other hemisphere at the same relative position to the gyri and sulci (e.g. inferior frontal gyrus). In contrast, the standard method of coordinate flipping commonly identifies positions outside of grey matter and/or the corresponding gyrus/sulcus. Using the landmark-based method and two distance metrics on the cortical surface (AFCD and FAD), we systematically characterized the agreement of the position of maximum correlation in the other hemisphere during rest (i.e. the functional correspondence) and the anatomical correspondence, as well as the degree of symmetry in these patterns across the hemispheres. These patterns were found to be largely symmetric. For the few vertices showing asymmetric patterns using the maximum correlation, the full correlation patterns across the hemispheres were still largely symmetric, indicating quantitative rather than qualitative functional asymmetries. The advantages of using the maximum correlation were demonstrated clearly by the ability to characterize fine-grained cross-hemispheric cortical maps amongst functional correspondences in areas with well-known maps (e.g. motor and occipital cortex), as well as in a brain region with no previously described fine-grained map (e.g. inferior frontal gyrus). These quantitative and sometimes subtle relationships would be difficult to investigate using the standard method of coordinate flipping, highlighting the strengths of finding correspondences through cortical landmarks.</p>
      <p>One clear implication of the widespread observations of point-to-point symmetry across the hemispheres in the resting-state correlations is that artifactual explanations such as hardware, motion, and non-neural physiological artifacts become progressively unlikely. Furthermore, explanations in terms of explicit cognitive processes and general mental state will have a difficult time addressing the full spatial extent of these results without assuming that each subject is mentally rehearsing their full sensory, cognitive, and motor repertoires every few minutes (i.e. during a single fMRI run). A much more likely explanation is that these results are driven by internally generated, coordinated fluctuations in neurally derived components of the BOLD signal, reflecting a combination of mono- and polysynaptic interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Hagmann1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Honey1">[56]</xref>. While explicit cognitive processes can indeed have a measureable, albeit modest, effect on resting-state correlations within the “default” network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-AndrewsHanna1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Mason1">[58]</xref>, the current results complement the findings of other recent studies of spontaneous BOLD fluctuations in anesthetized monkeys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Margulies1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Vincent1">[60]</xref> and sleeping humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Fransson1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-LarsonPrior1">[62]</xref> in ruling out the exclusive contribution of explicit cognition. However, the extent to which the symmetric correlation patterns that we observe are carried by direct projections via the corpus callosum is unclear. A recent resting-state study of patients with complete agenesis of the corpus callosum (AgCC) reported largely identical cross-hemispheric correlation patterns to normal controls over a wide set of brain regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Tyszka1">[63]</xref>. Whether or not AgCC patients would exhibit the same sorts of fine-grained symmetric functional maps reported here is unknown. It is also noteworthy that homotopic callosal connections in early visual areas in monkeys are primarily restricted to representations of the vertical meridian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Kennedy1">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Maunsell1">[65]</xref>, leaving much of visually responsive cortex without callosal inputs. Visual cortex in the depths of the calcarine sulcus in humans, shown here to exhibit fine-grained functional correspondency, is more involved in representing the horizontal meridian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Tootell1">[66]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Wandell1">[67]</xref>, potentially casting further doubt on the role of the callosum in mediating all of these functional relationships. Nevertheless, some aspects of our results are indeed reminiscent of callosal anatomical connections in monkeys. For example, both owl and macaque monkeys lack callosal connections in the territories of the posterior superior temporal sulcus and the inferior lateral temporal cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Cusick1">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Killackey1">[69]</xref>, similar to the target locations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048847-g003">Figure 3</xref> that correspond to no seeds. We would suggest that these similar patterns of contralateral connectedness in different species and modalities are not a coincidence and might reflect the formation of direct callosal connections over fine spatial scales.</p>
      <p>The striking patterns of symmetry present in the current study might be taken as inconsistent with the lateralization of cognitive functions such as language and visuospatial attention. How is it that these phenomena can co-exist? The first point to make is that cross-hemispheric symmetry versus asymmetry does not necessarily equate to a bilateral versus unilateral functional organization. For example, if the left inferior frontal gyrus is more involved in language processing than the right inferior frontal gyrus, it does not logically require the right inferior frontal gyrus to be “weaker” in its respective cortical interactions. Instead, the right inferior frontal gyrus could be engaged at an equal level in some other cognitive function. The relevant distinction is in what information processing content the brain regions carries, and this information may not be readily apparent in cross-hemispheric correlation strengths. If there is a reliable index of functional lateralization in resting-state correlation patterns, it will likely be necessary to examine not only the cross-hemispheric but also the intra-hemispheric correlations in a systematic manner. These measures would also need to be examined in conjunction with independent measures of the relevant behavioral functions, such as scores on a standardized language battery. All of that said, several of the brain regions with large FAD values appear to overlap with language-related cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048847-Turken1">[7]</xref>, suggesting a possible basis for those asymmetries. It may therefore be valuable for future studies to utilize landmark-based correspondence methods to jointly examine intra- and inter-hemispheric BOLD correlations, along with behavioral measures of cognitive functions that are believed to be lateralized.</p>
