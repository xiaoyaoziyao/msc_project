<abstract>
<p>Insect pollination benefits over three quarters of the world's major crops. There is growing concern that observed declines in pollinators may impact on production and revenues from animal pollinated crops. Knowing the distribution of pollinators is therefore crucial for estimating their availability to pollinate crops; however, in general, we have an incomplete knowledge of where these pollinators occur. We propose a method to predict geographical patterns of pollination service to crops, novel in two elements: the use of pollinator records rather than expert knowledge to predict pollinator occurrence, and the inclusion of the managed pollinator supply. We integrated a maximum entropy species distribution model (SDM) with an existing pollination service model (PSM) to derive the availability of pollinators for crop pollination. We used nation-wide records of wild and managed pollinators (honey bees) as well as agricultural data from Great Britain. We first calibrated the SDM on a representative sample of bee and hoverfly crop pollinator species, evaluating the effects of different settings on model performance and on its capacity to identify the most important predictors. The importance of the different predictors was better resolved by SDM derived from simpler functions, with consistent results for bees and hoverflies. We then used the species distributions from the calibrated model to predict pollination service of wild and managed pollinators, using field beans as a test case. The PSM allowed us to spatially characterize the contribution of wild and managed pollinators and also identify areas potentially vulnerable to low pollination service provision, which can help direct local scale interventions. This approach can be extended to investigate geographical mismatches between crop pollination demand and the availability of pollinators, resulting from environmental change or policy scenarios.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The importance of ecosystems to human well-being was documented by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, which also recognised that the majority of pollinators are in decline or threatened <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Hassan1">[1]</xref>. Crop pollination is a key ecosystem service vital to the maintenance of both wild plant communities and agricultural productivity. Over three quarters of the world's major crops benefit from insect pollination, with an economic value estimated to be around € 153 billion globally in 2005 and approximately € 500 million in the United Kingdom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Gallai1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-UKNationalEcosystem1">[4]</xref>. Pollination services are mainly provided by wild pollinators (bees, hoverflies, flies, moths, beetles) and domesticated bees (primarily honey bee <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>). The recent declines observed in pollinators, mainly bees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Potts1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Biesmeijer1">[6]</xref>, may therefore impact on the production of and profits from pollinator-dependent crops. For instance, long-term trends of global crop production suggest that to compensate for a 3–8% yield reduction expected in absence of animal pollination, the expansion of agricultural land would be much greater (ca. 25%, and proportionally much greater in the developing world), which in turn could accelerate habitat destruction and contribute to further pollination loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Aizen1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>Knowing spatial patterns of managed and wild pollinators is therefore crucial to estimate their availability to crops and to inform management strategies. In general, however, we have incomplete knowledge of where wild pollinators occur. To overcome this, a recent approach proposed by Lonsdorf <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Lonsdorf1">[8]</xref> derives the probability of occurrence of wild bees from a relative availability (from 0 to 1) of nesting sites and floral resources within a landscape, assessed for a few large guilds of species. This probability is then used to derive the relative pollinator service available to a particular crop, taking into account crop location, its potential pollinators and their foraging distance.</p>
<p>Here we propose an approach that combines the Lonsdorf model to derive pollinator services, with predicted pollinator occurrences from species records rather than from landscape suitability. One of the preferred tools to predict species spatial patterns from geographically and temporally sparse biodiversity data are species distribution models (SDMs), which now offer a wide range of approaches due to enhanced computational resources, increasing availability of spatially explicit environmental information and accessibility of species occurrence databases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Guisan1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Elith1">[10]</xref>. SDMs mainly differ in the requirements of the species records (e.g. presence and true absence, presence and background, presence only) and in the algorithms used to define the species niche as a function of the predictors (e.g. regression methods, machine learning techniques, Bayesian statistics) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Peterson1">[11]</xref>. While it is unlikely that a single modelling approach will outperform all others in any situation, comparative work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Elith1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Tsoar1">[12]</xref> helps to identify the main elements affecting model performance, and thus represents a valuable resource to orient the end user in the choice of the modelling approach. In this study we use the maximum entropy method implemented within the freely available software MaxEnt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Phillips1">[13]</xref>, to derive species distributions from sparse pollinator records. MaxEnt is a general purpose machine-learning technique that estimates the potential distribution of the species by estimating the probability distribution of maximum entropy (i.e. that is most spread out), subject to the constraints derived from the available occurrence data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Phillips1">[13]</xref>. MaxEnt has received increasing attention within the field of SDM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0076308.s001">File S1</xref>: Fig. S1–1), both in single species applications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-BlachOvergaard1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Anderson1">[15]</xref> and in comparisons of algorithms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Tognelli1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Hernandez1">[17]</xref>. Extensive experimental work has allowed guidance for several settings of MaxEnt modelling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Phillips2">[18]</xref>, as well as drawing attention to the main elements affecting its performance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Phillips3">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Anderson2">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>First, we describe the main steps and tests carried out to calibrate the MaxEnt model; we then show the predictions of the calibrated model for a representative sample of crop-pollinators within Great Britain; finally, we use the predicted species distributions to derive the potential pollination service of wild pollinators and managed honey bees, using the annual legume field bean <italic>Vicia faba</italic> as a test case. In conclusion, we discuss some of the methodological advantages of our approach, the remaining challenges and how it can be further applied to other ecological questions.</p>

<title>Wild pollinator data</title>
<p>We used presence-only records of wild bees and hoverflies collected within the period 2000–2010 (“Bees, Wasps and Ants Recording Society”, BWARS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Bees1">[22]</xref>; “Hoverfly Recording Scheme”, HRS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Hoverfly1">[23]</xref>). The spatial accuracy of the data varied between 10 m and 10 km; we chose 1 km<sup>2</sup> as a suitable resolution to balance the aim to derive patterns at a national extent as well as to inform decisions at the local scale. We registered all records with accuracy finer than or equal to 1 km to a grid of 1 km<sup>2</sup> cells, removing duplicates so that within each cell there was only one record of the same species. We use the term “<italic>records</italic>” to mean the number of original records for each species, with accuracy finer or equal to 1 km, whilst we use “<italic>occurrences</italic>” to denote the number of 1 km<sup>2</sup> grid cells occupied by a species.</p>
<p>To calibrate the model, we selected a subset of pollinator species representing a range of geographic distributions. To follow a repeatable and objective procedure, we used hierarchical cluster analysis to group the species based on the number of occurrences, minimum and maximum latitude and longitude (expressed as northing and easting on the British National Grid), and spatial distribution. Spatial distribution was measured as the longest distance within the third quartile of the pairwise distances between the occurrences of each species; we preferred the third quartile over the fourth quartile, to avoid potential outliers and thus obtain a better characterisation of the species' distribution extent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-AguirreGutirrez1">[24]</xref>. We selected about one third of the species from within each resulting cluster, ensuring representation across genera. Finally, we used visual inspection of the species occurrence maps to confirm they represented contrasting geographic distributions (e.g. ranging from few to many occurrences, and from narrow to wide range). The selection was carried out separately for bees and hoverflies.</p>
<p>Six hoverfly species and 22 bee species were selected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0076308.s002">File S2</xref>: Table S2–1). The number of occurrences ranged from 232 to 4048 for hoverflies and from 12 to 4144 for bees, and longest third quartile distance ranged from 215.4 km to 312.6 km for hoverflies and from 63.8 km to 763.9 km for bees.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2a2">
<title>Managed pollinator data</title>
<p>The distribution of the managed honey bees was derived from the optional beekeeping register BeeBase, held by the National Bee Unit at the Food and Environment Research Agency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-BeeBase1">[25]</xref>. The number of bee foragers was modelled at the 4 km<sup>2</sup> resolution from the size and location of apiaries in England and Wales using the estimated average foraging distance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Beekman1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Visscher1">[28]</xref>. At the time of this study, a sufficient coverage of apiaries from which to model forager numbers was not available for Scotland. To match the grain to the other pollinator data, the number of foragers was divided by four, assuming a uniform distribution across the four 1 km<sup>2</sup> grid cells. The data were then linearly rescaled between 0 and 1, to provide a relative score of honey bee foragers per km<sup>2</sup>.</p>

This assumes a uniform survey effort over the entire study area, but if this assumption is violated the background information should reflect the sample bias. A possible correction is to restrict the selection of the background points to a region where a target group of species has been observed by similar methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Phillips3">[19]</xref>. We tested for violation of this assumption by comparing the AUC (Area Under the Curve of the Receiver Operating Characteristic) of models based on all known records of crop pollinators in Great Britain (i.e. the target group background, TGB), against the AUC of models based on <italic>n</italic>-time sampling an equal number of points from the entire study area (referred as null models) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Raes1">[41]</xref>. We found that the average AUC of 10 sets of 5000 points drawn from the TGB was significantly greater than the average AUC of 100 null models from the entire study area (0.771±0.002 and 0.543±0.005 respectively). The background localities for the individual SDMs were therefore drawn from within the TGB.</p>

<title>Model calibration</title>
<p>During the model calibration we evaluated the single and combined effects of changing two main MaxEnt settings:</p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item>
<p>Choice of the feature classes (the functions) used to fit the data: default settings currently allow for six feature classes (<italic>Linear</italic>, <italic>Quadratic</italic>, <italic>Product</italic>, <italic>Threshold</italic>, <italic>Hinge</italic> and <italic>Categorical</italic>), provided sufficient samples are available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Elith2">[42]</xref>. For each species, we compared models with default settings against models built with <italic>Hinge</italic> features alone, which are base functions for piecewise linear splines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Phillips2">[18]</xref>. When using <italic>Hinge</italic> alone, we modified the threshold for minimum sample size to 12 (rather than 15, the default) to allow its application to the full set of calibration species (which included <italic>Andrena niveata</italic> with 12 records and <italic>Lasioglossum semilucens</italic> with 13).</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>Default prevalence: prevalence is defined as the probability of presence at ordinary occurrence points and, when absence data are not available, MaxEnt assigns it 0.5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Phillips2">[18]</xref>. It is defined over specific spatial and temporal scales, which should be taken into account particularly when working with pools of species differing in their rarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Elith2">[42]</xref>. For each species, we compared models with default prevalence 0.5 to models where this value was modified to reflect the species commonality relative to the rest of the species within the pollinator set. To our knowledge there are no theoretically based rules to adjust this value; we therefore empirically rescaled it, considering the number of available records, the number of occurrences and the number of years with non-zero observations over the temporal scale (2000–2010). Each species was then assigned a new prevalence, from 0.1 to 0.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0076308.s003">File S3</xref>: Table S3–1, Fig. S3–1, Figs S3–2.1 and S3–2.2).</p>

<title>Model performance</title>
<p>We evaluated the effects of changing default settings on model calibration with two metrics:</p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item>
<p>The model testing AUC and its standard deviation (AUC<sub>SD</sub>), using mixed effect models with species as random factor. We tested whether changing default parameters significantly affected the AUC and its variability between different models.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>The standard deviation (SD) of the <italic>Permutation importance (%)</italic> between predictors and background, using generalized linear models. The <italic>Permutation importance</italic> is derived by randomly permuting the values of each predictor between presence and background in turn; the model is re-evaluated on the permuted values and the resulting drop in training AUC is then normalized to percentages. We expected that a model with good discriminatory power would result in a greater spread between the significance of the different predictors.</p>
</list-item></list>
<p>All models were carried out through <italic>k</italic>-fold cross-validation, where data are divided into <italic>k</italic> mutually exclusive subsets: for each run, <italic>k</italic>–1 of them are combined into a set for training, and one is used for the prediction (i.e. model testing). The number of mutually exclusive subsets was 10 for all species. Evaluation was performed on the average of the cross-validation runs (for AUC, AUC<sub>SD</sub>, Permutation importance and its SD).</p>
<p>After completing the model calibration, we used null models to test whether the resulting SDMs provided a significantly better fit than expected by chance alone. With presence-only data the maximum achievable AUC is &lt;1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Wiley1">[43]</xref>: namely, it is 1-<italic>a</italic>/2, with <italic>a</italic> being the true fraction of the study area occupied by a species, typically unknown when absence data are not available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Phillips1">[13]</xref>. To assess SDM accuracy, therefore, we compared the average AUC value of each species SDM (AUC<sub>SDM</sub>) with the average AUC value of a set of null models (AUC<sub>NM</sub>) where species records were replaced by randomly chosen locations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Raes1">[41]</xref>. We expected AUC<sub>SDM</sub> &gt; AUC<sub>NM</sub>.</p>
<p>Following the assessment of model performance, we tested whether the predictors that were most important for fitting the training data were also the most important for predicting species distribution. Single-predictor models are built within MaxEnt for the training and testing phases: we ranked them according to their gain (a measure of model fit), assigning one the model with the lowest increase in gain. We then computed the Spearman's rank correlation between training and testing models for each predictor, using <italic>Mean</italic> and <italic>Mode</italic>. Their observed correlations were tested against the frequency of randomly generated correlations, using 999 bootstrap replicates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Crawley1">[44]</xref>.

<title>Pollinator distribution models</title>
<p>The settings chosen from the model calibration were used to derive SDMs for the wild pollinators of field bean. We used expert knowledge from our team and existing literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Free1">[45]</xref> to select species known to pollinate field bean. For each species, we used “<italic>10<sup>th</sup> percentile training presence</italic>” as threshold to derive a binary map (1 = presence, 0 =  absence) from the predicted continuous probability of each of the cross-validation runs. We summed together the 10 binary maps and we took the areas where the sum equalled 10 (i.e. areas where all 10 runs had predicted presence) as the presence area for that species. This strict criterion implies that the sites where all 10 runs have predicted presence identify conditions of greatest suitability for the species. The effects of this choice compared to a less conservative criterion are presented in the results. We then assigned to each presence area the average probability of presence derived from the 10 model runs, this became the predicted likelihood of occurrence for that particular species. This map was used as pollinator source to derive the potential pollinator service.</p>
<p>For consistency with the modelled distributions of wild pollinators, we applied a threshold to the probability of occurrence of managed honey bees to distinguish absence from presence. We used the fifth percentile as a cut-off, corresponding to a 0.001 probability of occurrence, and we assigned “absence” to areas with probability below this threshold. This threshold is less conservative than the one used for wild pollinators, to reflect the fact that the data on managed pollinators are based on information updated annually and on dispersal functions empirically derived.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we have predicted the current potential distribution of the main crop pollinators of field beans in Great Britain, to derive the potential service provision. Pollinator availability for crop pollination was based on SDMs from species occurrences, rather than on landscape suitability scores from expert knowledge. Potential service provision was assessed for wild and managed pollinators, which to our knowledge has never been done at this scale.</p>
<p>The calibration of the SDMs played an important part in this process making best use of the large species dataset and warranting use of the model outputs as inputs in the pollination service model.</p>
<p>For crops benefiting from insect pollination, we assumed that likelihood of species occurrence can be used as a proxy for potential pollinator service provision, thus implying two main premises: the first one is that the two variables scale proportionally; the second one is that a unit difference in the likelihood of occurrence in one species means the same change in service provision as in a different species.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Species distribution models</title>
<p>Prior to the modelling work, we tested for sample selection bias within the pollinator records to define the appropriate background: opportunistic records are in fact a great resource to predict species distribution, but they rarely provide a representative sample of the study area. The effects of the choice of background on model predictions are widely documented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Phillips3">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Raes1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-BarbetMassin1">[51]</xref> and therefore it was important that this step was carried out at the start.</p>
<p>In the absence of an independent dataset covering the extent of our study region and the entire spectrum of species, each SDM was built using replication through cross-validation, so that after splitting the occurrence data into groups, models were built and tested using all the groups in turn. An advantage of this method, over using a single partitioning for training and testing, is that it uses all the data for validation, thus making better use of small datasets and minimising the impact of possible outliers.</p>
<p>During model calibration, we used AUC as a threshold-independent measure of model performance. Sole reliance on this method has been criticised <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Termansen1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Austin1">[53]</xref> as AUC depends on predictive success and not on explanatory value and it is affected by the geographical extent of the model; the latter point is particularly important if AUC is used to compare modelling performance between different species or between models built with different base datasets. In our study, however, we used AUC to compare models based on the same datasets and within species.</p>
<p>The similar AUC between models derived with default settings for feature class and models derived with <italic>Hinge</italic> alone has been observed in at least one other study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Elith2">[42]</xref>. In addition, the similar variation in model performance between the 10-fold cross-validation runs, independent of the feature class, indicated comparable stability in their predictions.</p>
<p>Our results on the importance of different predictors indicated a superior discriminatory power within models built with <italic>Hinge</italic> alone, probably due to the greater flexibility of fitted functions when <italic>All</italic> feature classes are allowed. It also became apparent that some of the response curves derived from single-predictor models were too narrowly fitted to the training data when allowing for <italic>All</italic> feature classes (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Syfert1">[54]</xref>), which further supported the choice of using the <italic>Hinge</italic> alone.</p>
<p>The effect of changing the default prevalence to reflect the relative rarity of each species was significant (and positive) only within the bee group, possibly due to their greater variation in number of records. Modifying prevalence has implications for the maximum value predicted by the MaxEnt logistic output <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Phillips2">[18]</xref>, noticeable when comparing response curves generated with default and modified prevalence. Since logistic outputs should be interpreted in relation to a temporal and spatial scale appropriate for each species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Elith2">[42]</xref>, modifying the prevalence allowed us to make the outputs of the SDMs more comparable across species, and to account for their relative differences when evaluating crop pollination service.</p>
<p>The results on predictors' importance highlight <italic>within</italic> and <italic>across</italic> species properties (training vs. testing and mean vs. mode respectively). The <italic>within</italic> species agreement on the predictors' importance between training and testing data suggests that the models are transferable. With climatic predictors being in general the most important ones, this also indicates the possibility of investigating the effects of projected climate changes on the future distribution of wild pollinators. This aspect is of particular interest given the projected shifts in suitable environmental conditions predicted for many taxa including pollinators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Giannini1">[55]</xref>, and the potential phenological mismatch within mutualistic relations, such as plants and pollinators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Gordo1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Memmott1">[57]</xref>. The significant correlation between the <italic>Mean</italic> and the <italic>Mode</italic> used to rank predictors' importance can be interpreted as a general agreement on their relative importance <italic>across</italic> species.</p>

<title>Applications to crop pollinators</title>
<p>We adapted Lonsdorf's <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Lonsdorf1">[8]</xref> model to derive pollinator service, using the SDMs derived for the field bean pollinators as inputs. Our choice was motivated by three main reasons: firstly, for the extent of our study area, it would be difficult to rely on expert knowledge to provide landscape suitability scores for pollinators and expert opinion may not be available for poorly known species. Secondly, regularly maintained databases with nation-wide pollinator records offered us the opportunity to rely on actual, albeit opportunistic, sightings. These data have already proven instrumental in detecting changes in species richness across temporal and spatial scales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Biesmeijer1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Keil1">[58]</xref>. Thirdly, our approach also accounted for the contribution of managed pollinators, providing the opportunity to compare patterns of pollination service between wild and domesticated pollinators. This is particularly important, given the potentially changing contribution made by both types of crop pollinators in the UK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Breeze1">[59]</xref>. There is increasing evidence highlighting the importance of wild pollinators to crop production worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Garibaldi1">[60]</xref>. However, agricultural intensification and alteration of natural habitats, have shown negative effects on wild pollinator communities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Kremen1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Carvalheiro1">[62]</xref> and for appropriate mitigation measures to be designed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Klein2">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Carvalheiro2">[64]</xref>, it is crucial to understand how different pollinator species are distributed in space and how this is determined by relationships with their abiotic environment. We believe that the work described here can be used to this end.</p>
<p>Our study has provided predicted PSM for a specific crop, field bean, as a case study to demonstrate how the general approach can be applied to other crops. For application of this method elsewhere we highlight several advantages and further challenges. For instance, since the results are spatially explicit, they can be used to simultaneously investigate the predicted pollinator supply and the underlying extent of crop parcels. This information can help quantify relevant risk factors such as the fraction of crop vulnerable to low pollinator supply. As previously illustrated by the recent work of Lautenbach <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Lautenbach1">[65]</xref> in their map of global pollination benefits, spatially explicit information of this kind can provide a first instrument to prioritize areas where policies aiming at preserving pollination services and mitigating potential pollinator deficits for agricultural crops can be effectively targeted.</p>
<p>Whilst the cross-validation approach used during the SDM allowed us to use the available species occurrences to train and validate the models, testing for significant correlation between the PSM predictions and the pollination service actually provided, would require additional data, which are currently unavailable. In particular, we would need empirical information on pollinator density, flower visitation rate and fruit set for a representative set of crop parcels. Given the extent of the study region, parcels would need to be selected along the gradient of the environmental variables captured by the model, and power analysis would be needed to determine how may parcel replicates would be necessary to achieve the desired level of confidence. An additional difficulty relates to the scale (resolution) of the current model, which is suitable for country-wide and local scale patterns, but may be too coarse to draw correlations with what is observed at the crop parcel scale. We recommend that future applications of our method consider building models with species and environmental layers matching the spatial scale of the field work, thereby allowing direct testing of predictions. The empirical information being collected in different agricultural systems worldwide has already proven instrumental for drawing general patterns, such as the relative importance of wild pollinators vs. managed pollinators for enhancing fruit set (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Garibaldi1">[60]</xref> and references therein). A number of studies funded under the UK Insect Pollinator Initiative, may provide the information needed towards a first validation step over the next few years.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Next Steps</title>
<p>The primary interest of our study was to show how the Lonsdorf <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Lonsdorf1">[8]</xref> pollination service model can be integrated with the MaxEnt species distribution model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Phillips1">[13]</xref> to predict geographical patterns of pollination service to crops. We chose these two models since they both have peer-reviewed track records of successful applications in their respective fields but, to our knowledge, they have never been used in combination. The two main elements of novelty in our study are the use of pollinator records rather than expert knowledge to predict wild pollinator occurrence, and the inclusion of managed pollinator data. This approach allowed us to map the relative contribution of each pollinator group, and also identify areas potentially vulnerable to low service provision. Thus the outputs can help direct local scale mitigation measures, such as agri-environment scheme options. Despite the difficulties common to proxy-based approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Lautenbach2">[66]</xref> the method we have proposed is sufficiently flexible to incorporate different environmental variables of biological relevance, which may be available for other geographic regions, useful to refine predictions, or relevant when the models are applied to smaller spatial extents. The last point should be of particular interest to studies at the field parcel scale, where detailed information of landscape elements may be collected and used to build the models. The possibility to correlate relative scores and proxies to empirical data is likely to provide relevant information for both the SDM and the PSM: for instance, using information on farm management and landscape composition and configuration, Kennedy <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076308-Kennedy1">[67]</xref> have assessed the strength of the correlation between different predictors of bee abundance and richness and empirical data collected in 39 crop systems across the globe.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the inclusion of local pollinator abundance and of the pollination effectiveness of different pollinators are arguably the most urgent next challenges we need to face to help to translate the relative suitability scores into units of crop pollination service and ultimately yield. Service provision, in fact, results from species' efficiency and local abundance.</p>
<p>We have used field beans as test case, but the method we have illustrated can be applied to other crops, provided that their distribution and main pollinators are known. In addition, this approach can be extended to investigate the projected effects of climate change on pollination services. To do that, it would require predictive SDMs for both the crop of interest and its pollinators, to reveal any compositional change in the pollinator community, as well as any potential geographical mismatch between crop and pollinators.</p>
