<title>Aim</title>
<p>To evaluate the effects of metformin (Met) on inflammation, oxidative stress, and bone loss in a rat model of ligature-induced periodontitis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Materials &amp; methods</title>
<p>Male albino Wistar rats were divided randomly into five groups of twenty-one rats each, and given the following treatments for 10 days: (1) no ligature + water, (2) ligature + water, (3) ligature + 50 mg/kg Met, (4) ligature + 100 mg/kg Met, and (5) ligature + 200 mg/kg Met. Water or Met was administered orally. Maxillae were fixed and scanned using Micro-computed Tomography (μCT) to quantitate linear and bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV) volumetric bone loss. Histopathological characteristics were assessed through immunohistochemical staining for MMP-9, COX-2, the RANKL/RANK/OPG pathway, SOD-1, and GPx-1. Additionally, confocal microscopy was used to analyze osteocalcin fluorescence. UV-VIS analysis was used to examine the levels of malondialdehyde, glutathione, IL-1β and TNF-α from gingival tissues. Quantitative RT-PCR reaction was used to gene expression of AMPK, NF-κB (p65), and Hmgb1 from gingival tissues. Significance among groups were analysed using a one-way ANOVA. A p-value of p&lt;0.05 indicated a significant difference.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Treatment with 50 mg/kg Met significantly reduced concentrations of malondialdehyde, IL-1β, and TNF-α (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Additionally, weak staining was observed for COX-2, MMP-9, RANK, RANKL, SOD-1, and GPx-1 after 50 mg/kg Met. OPG and Osteocalcin showed strong staining in the same group. Radiographically, linear measurements showed a statistically significant reduction in bone loss after 50 mg/kg Met compared to the ligature and Met 200 mg/kg groups. The same pattern was observed volumetrically in BV/TV and decreased osteoclast number (p&lt;0.05). RT-PCR showed increased AMPK expression and decreased expression of NF-κB (p65) and HMGB1 after 50 mg/kg Met.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Metformin, at a concentration of 50 mg/kg, decreases the inflammatory response, oxidative stress and bone loss in ligature-induced periodontitis in rats.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Periodontal disease is mediated by the inflammatory response in the host and bacteria in the dental tissue. In order for the disease to be established, susceptibility of the immunological response to bacterial infection is necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref001">1</xref>]. The disruption of the balance between osteoblast and osteoclast activities by bacterial products and inflammatory cytokines is the main underlying cause of inflammation-induced bone loss. Complex inflammatory signals and cytokines, including Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and prostaglandin E2, regulate osteoclastogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition to being a result of the changing balance in bone metabolism, periodontal disease may be affected by metabolic changes of systemic diseases, such as diabetes. Persistent hyperglycaemia leading to exaggerated immune-inflammatory responses that are induced by periodontal pathogens is likely responsible for the greater risk and severity of periodontal disease in diabetic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Metformin, a biguanide, is the top choice of oral agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes according to the guidelines (Consensus Statement of the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref005">5</xref>]. Metformin was shown to activate the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in intact cells and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref006">6</xref>]. AMPK may confer benefits in chronic inflammatory diseases independent of its ability to normalise blood glucose. Previous groups have expressed considerable interest in the identification and exploitation of its anti-inflammatory effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref008">8</xref>]. It has also been suggested that AMPK activation is responsible for the inhibition of NF-κB activation. AMPK has been shown to exert significant anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects in models of inflammatory/autoimmune disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Metformin may stimulate osteoblast differentiation through the transactivation of genes via AMPK regulation. AMPK has been shown to increase significantly the expression of the key osteogenic genes, such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin (OC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref011">11</xref>]. Taken together, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of metformin in oxidative stress, inflammation and bone loss, as well as the participation of the AMPK/NF-KB (p65) and HMGB1 in periodontitis disease in a rat model.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>Two-Months-old male Wistar rats (180g) were bred and handled at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), Brazil. This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the UFRN (CEUA, Permit Number: 066/2014). All surgery was performed under anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. In brief, animals were housed in standard conditions (12hr light/dark cycle and 22 ± 0.1°C), with standard chow and access to food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec008">
<title>Model for experimental periodontitis (EPD)</title>
<p>Animals were anesthetized by the IP injection of 10% ketamine (80 mg/kg, Quetamina, Vetnil, São Paulo, Brazil) and 2% xylazine (10 mg/kg, Calmium, São Paulo, Brazil). EPD was induced by the placement of a sterile nylon thread ligature (3–0; Polysuture, NP45330, São Paulo, Brazil) around the cervix of the maxillary left second molar. No ligature was added to the right contralateral side. Additionally, in 21 rats, no ligature was added to either the right or left side, which served as control animals. Animals were euthanized eleven days after the initial treatment by an i.p injection of 80 mg/kg thiopental (0.5 g Thiopentax, Cristália, São Paulo, Brazil).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec009">
<title>Drug treatments</title>
<p>Metformin hydrochloride (Met), 850mg (Medley, Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil) was dissolved in distilled water. Distilled water served as the vehicle treatment. All treatments (Met or vehicle) were administered by oral gavage 2 hours before the addition of the ligature (induction of EPD) and thereafter once daily for 10 days. The animals were assigned randomly to the following 5 groups of 21 rats each: (1) a no ligature group that received water (NL), (2) a ligature group that received water (L), (3) a ligature group treated with 50 mg/kg Met, (4) a ligature group treated with 100 mg/kg Met, and (5) a ligature group treated with 200 mg/kg Met. The dose selection for the present study was based on doses translation from animal to human studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref013">13</xref>].</p>

<title>Radiographic Micro-computed tomography (microCT) measurement of ABL</title>
<p>At the end of the experiment (10 days after addition of the ligature and first drug treatments), animals were euthanized; maxillae were dissected and fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 24 hours and Stored in 70% alcohol. Rat maxillae were scanned using micro-computed tomography (μCT, micro-CT) (Model 1172; SkyScan, Kontich, Belgium) at 20 micrometers resolution, as previously described (Hiyari et al). Micro-CT files were converted to Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files and imported into Dolphin software for linear bone height analysis. Linear bone height analysis was performed by orienting the second molar cementoenamel junctions (CEJ) parallel to each other in the coronal plane. In the axial plane, the middle of the crown was identified and linear bone distances were recorded on the mesial aspect of the second molar on the sagittal image. Additional measurements were taken 0.3mm palatal from the middle of the crown; again recording on the mesial aspect of the second molar on the sagittal image. The linear measurements were recorded from the CEJ to the alveolar crest (AC). Each second molar received a total of 2 measurements and these values were averaged for each group. To assess volumetric bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV) changes, samples were oriented using DataViewer (V.1.5.2 Bruker, Billerica, MA) such that the CEJ’s of the second molar were parallel to each other in the sagital and coronal planes. The axial plane showed the crowns of each molar, first, second, and third. Oriented images were analyzed using CTAn (V.1.16 Bruker, Billerica, MA). A 40 slice volume set at a threshold of 75 in the bifurcation área of the second molar was used as a region of interest for analysis. Analysis started at the slice where the second molar roots first presented with bifurcation and went down 40 slices towards the root apices. BV/TV values were recorded as a percent and averaged for each group (n≥3/group for all μCT analysis).</p>

<p>Hematoxylin and eosin stained alveolar bone specimens (n = 5/group) were evaluated on the following parameters: inflammatory cell influx and integrity of the alveolar bone and cementum. Samples were analyzed by a histologist in a single-blind fashion and graded as follows: a score of 0 indicated that inflammatory cell infiltration was absent or sparse, was restricted to the region of the marginal gingiva, and that the alveolar process and cementum were preserved; a score of 1 indicated moderate cellular infiltration (inflammatory cellular infiltration present on the entire gingival insert), minor alveolar resorption, and intact cementum; a score of 2 indicated accentuated cellular infiltration (inflammatory cellular infiltration present in the gingiva and in the periodontal ligament), accentuated degradation of the alveolar process, and partial destruction of the cementum; and a score of 3 indicated accentuated cellular infiltration, complete resorption of the alveolar process, and severe destruction of the cementum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref014">14</xref>]. In addition, all the osteoclasts found on the surface of the alveolar bone between the first and second molars were counted on H&amp;E stained slides, at 20x magnification. Only osteoclasts with two or more nuclei and in contact with the bone surface were counted. The result is expressed as the average osteoclast number per experimental group, considering at least 4 animals per group.

<title>Radiographic assessment of alveolar bone loss</title>
<p>Rats with EPD (L), and all concentrations of Met (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) treatment showed statistically significant more linear bone loss compared to NL (0.473mm ± 0.035mm). However, when comparing L (1.888mm ± 0.111mm) to 50 mg/kg Met (1.106 ± 0.161mm) treatment, bone loss was statistically reduced in 50 mg/kg Met treatment. All other concentrations of Met, 100 and 200 mg/kg, showed similar bone loss levels as the L group. The pattern was similar volumetrically. Focusing on the area of the bifurcation under the second molar, all groups show statistically significantly less BV/TV compared to NL (84.73% ± 2.35%). However, again, 50 mg/kg Met showed statistically more BV/TV (49.78% ± 8.96%) compared to L (1.77% ± 0.91%), 100 mg/kg Met (16.56% ± 7.28%), and 200 mg/kg Met (3.36% ± 0.98%), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183506.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Periodontal disease is an immune-inflammatory disease characterize by connective tissue breakdown, loss of attachment, and alveolar bone resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref020">20</xref>]. Evidence has linked reactive oxygen species (ROS) to the pathological destruction of connective tissue in periodontal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref022">22</xref>]. The hydroxyl radical can initiate a classical chain reaction known as lipid peroxidation, leading to bone reabsorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref023">23</xref>]. Hydrogen peroxide stimulates phosphorylation of the Factor Nuclear kappa B-inhibitor of kappa B <bold>(</bold>NF-κB–IκB) complex, activating NF-κB and facilitating nuclear translocation and downstream movement of proinflammatory cytokines, such as Tumour Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α), which are very important in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref024">24</xref>]. Superoxide generated at the osteoclast–bone interface is involved in bone matrix degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref025">25</xref>]. Superoxide is removed from tissue by superoxide dismutase (SOD). NF-κB is a transcription factor that is specifically activated when T cells are exposed to oxidant stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<p>In the present study, all Met doses caused significant reductions in the formation of malondialdehyde, a major end product of lipid peroxidation. In the ligature group treated with 50 mg/kg Met, the low degree of histological staining for enzymes involved in the neutralisation of ROS, such as SOD, implies a productive antioxidant effect, in which the formation of oxidative stress products is reduced by the stimulation of antioxidant enzyme activity. These results are corroborated by data reported by Akalin et al (ANO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref027">27</xref>], who found greater SOD activity in inflamed gingiva from patients with chronic periodontitis than in healthy gingiva from controls. SOD activity has been shown to increase directly after the occurrence of oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref028">28</xref>]. One of the oxidative stress reduction outcomes for the metformin-treated groups can be seen in the reduction of the gene expression of NF KB. Asehnoune,et al (ANO) showed that ROS can modulate NF-B-dependent transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref029">29</xref>].</p>
<p>Although NFKB expression was low in all metformin-treated groups at day 10, phenotypic characteristics of an active inflammatory process with high levels of IL-1β and TNF-alpha were still found in the groups treated with 100mg/ kg and 200mg /kg metformin. These findings may contribute to the lack of effect of the higher concentrations of Met in preventing bone loss. Accordingly, the lowest dose (50mg / kg) of metformin resulted in a significant reduction in IL-1β and TNF-alpha levels, as well as COX-2 immunostaining. A transcription factor directly related to the mechanism of action of metformin is activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK provides a target capable of mediating the beneficial metabolic effects of metformin. AMPK is a key for metabolic enzymes such as 3-hidroxi-3-metilglutaril CoA redutase (HMGCoA redutase) and acetil CoA carboxilase (ACC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref030">30</xref>]</p>
<p>Other important role of AMPK is the regulation of bone metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref031">31</xref>],. Osteocalcin (OC) is a bone-specific protein, specifically synthesized in osteoblasts. OC is recognized as one of the markers of the mature osteoblast phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref032">32</xref>]. Kasai et al evaluated the effects of metformin on matrix mineralization by osteoblasts. For both MC3T3-E1 and primary osteoblasts, Matrix mineralization induced by ascorbic acid and β-glycerophosphate were significantly inhibited by the presence of 2mM metformin. Lower concentrations of metformin failed to affect matrix mineralization in both cell types, but high concentrations of metformin affected matrix mineralization. The degree of AMPKα phosphorylation was well correlated with the inhibition of matrix mineralization in metformin-stimulated osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref033">33</xref>]. On the other hand, findings indicate the participation of AMPK by negatively regulating the RANKL[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref034">34</xref>]. Lee at al found that RANKL itself can positively stimulate AMPK activation up to the 50ng/ml concentration of RANKL, which implies that stimulated AMPK will inhibit RANKL, however concentrations of 100ng/ml RANKL were not able to activate AMPK[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref034">34</xref>], indicating a possible saturation of this negative feedback.</p>
<p>In our study we were able to verify in vivo that low doses of metformin (50mg/kg) reduced bone loss and increased relative mRNA expression AMPK, with osteocalcin elevation and reduced RANKL immunolabeling, thereby indicating an increase in the presence of mature osteoblasts and a reduction of osteoclasts number. On the other hand, the higher doses of metformin (100mg/kg or 200mg/kg) appear to have negatively regulated AMPK. This finding may partially explain why the higher doses failed to reduce the bone loss induced by periodontitis, considering some studies showing that activation of AMPK promotes bone formation in vitro[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref035">35</xref>].</p>
<p>HMGB1, a nuclear protein released from activated macrophages or injured cells, displays pro-inflammatory cytokine-like properties once it enters the extracellular space and HMGB1-induced osteoclastogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref036">36</xref>]. Once in the extracellular space, HMGB1 seems to be an important participant in RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref037">37</xref>]. In our study it was possible to verify a reduction of the gene expression of HMGB1 in the group treated with the dose of 50mg / kg metformin and consequently lower immunolabeling of RANKL, which supports our findings of a lower osteoclast activity in this group, and consequently lower bone loss.</p>
<p>Another important finding is the disorganization of the extracellular matrix in the periodontal tissue. Selective production of MMP-9 can lead to the acceleration of matrix degradation in pathological conditions, such as periodontitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref038">38</xref>]. In this study, weak labelling for MMP-9 was observed in the 50-mg/kg MET group.</p>
<p>Our data showed that the best bone loss results were found when metformin was administered at a lower dose of 50 mg / kg, correlating drug dosage from animal to human dose<bold>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref013">13</xref>],</bold> We verified that the therapeutic dose of metformin in humans occurs in a range of 1700mg-3000mg/day. The dose of 50 mg/kg used in this study is below the therapeutic dose (approximately 567 mg/day), while the groups treated with 100 or 200 mg/kg is equivalent to the therapeutic dose used in diabetic humans. However it is important to consider that the animals in this study were not diabetic, since our objective was to verify the pleiotropic effect of metformin in periodontal disease. Thus, we believe that this effect of low dose metformin in animals with periodontal disease without diabetes interfered differently in bone loss. However, we also believe that although doses of 100mg/kg or 200mg/kg are equivalent to the human therapeutic dose, when administered in animals without diabetes it can affect matrix mineralization by osteoblasts, as seen in the in vitro study carried out by Kasai et al. (ANO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183506.ref033">33</xref>].</p>
<p>Our study demonstrated the ability of Met to regulate AMPK, NF-κB p65, and Hmgb1 gene expression, resulting in the reduction of malondialdehyde, TNF-α, and IL-1β levels and control bone loss. Ultimately, Metformin showed anti-inflammatory, antioxidant activity and decreased bone loss.</p>
