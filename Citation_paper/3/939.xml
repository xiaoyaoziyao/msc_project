          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Curcuma has long been used as an anti-inflammatory agent in inflammatory bowel disease. Since gastrointestinal motility is impaired in inflammatory states, the aim of this work was to evaluate if <italic>Curcuma Longa</italic> had any effect on intestinal motility.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>The biological activity of Curcuma extract was evaluated against Carbachol induced contraction in isolated mice intestine. Acute and chronic colitis were induced in Balb/c mice by Dextran Sulphate Sodium administration (5% and 2.5% respectively) and either Curcuma extract (200 mg/kg/day) or placebo was thereafter administered for 7 and 21 days respectively. Spontaneous contractions and the response to Carbachol and Atropine of ileum and colon were studied after colitis induction and Curcuma administration.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Curcuma extract reduced the spontaneous contractions in the ileum and colon; the maximal response to Carbachol was inhibited in a non-competitive and reversible manner. Similar results were obtained in ileum and colon from Curcuma fed mice. DSS administration decreased the motility, mainly in the colon and Curcuma almost restored both the spontaneous contractions and the response to Carbachol after 14 days assumption, compared to standard diet, but a prolonged assumption of Curcuma decreased the spontaneous and Carbachol-induced contractions.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>Curcuma extract has a direct and indirect myorelaxant effect on mouse ileum and colon, independent of the anti-inflammatory effect. The indirect effect is reversible and non-competitive with the cholinergic agent. These results suggest the use of curcuma extract as a spasmolytic agent.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) are chronic inflammatory conditions of the intestinal tract: they are the consequence of environmental influences, genetic disorders, intestinal microbiota alterations, leading to an abnormal immune response with inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Strober1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Xavier1">[2]</xref>. A combination of all these factors is probably necessary for clinical expression of the disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Triantafillidis1">[3]</xref>. Although the inflammation may remain limited to certain gastrointestinal segments, the function of the whole tract is altered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Jacobson1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Aube1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Blandizzi1">[6]</xref>. Intestinal motility has been reported to be impaired in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Kohno1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Vrees1">[8]</xref>. Inflammation is associated with decreased colonic mixing and haustra formation, but increased propulsive motility, leading to diarrhea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Tomita1">[9]</xref>. The physiopathology of dysmotility in IBD has not been completely elucidated: a selective hyperactivity 10] of the non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic inhibition has been documented in human colon. Disruption in intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Qureshi1">[11]</xref>, defective norepinephrine release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Motagally1">[12]</xref>, impairment of the protease-activated receptor 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Sato1">[13]</xref>, defective inhibitory neuron dependent relaxation in the colon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Mizuta1">[14]</xref> have been reported in the experimental animal. Conventional therapy for IBD is hampered by toxicity, intolerance or slow onset of action <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Mattar1">[15]</xref>. Recently, anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha and other biologic agents have been introduced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Triantafillidis1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Lim1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Rutgeerts1">[18]</xref>, but their safety in long term treatment has not been proved jet. Therefore, the use of natural substances with no side effects, though not so powerful effective as drugs so far employed, is encouraged, at least in the prevention and in the maintenance of remissions of IBD. Unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, microbes and microbial products are currently under investigation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Triantafillidis1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>Curcuma longa</italic> (turmeric) is a perennial herb, cultivated in the Southeast Asia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Ammon1">[19]</xref>. In traditional medicine it has been used for centuries due to its antitumor, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant properties and it presents acethylcholinesterase inhibitory activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Singh1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Ahmed1">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Turmeric chemicals include curcumin (the primary constituent responsible for its yellow color), demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin, as well as volatile oils, sugars, proteins, and resins, curcumin (1,7-bis[4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl]-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione) being the most studied compound <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Singh2">[26]</xref>. The anti-inflammatory activity of curcumin has been investigated in various in vitro and in vivo studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-CamachoBarquero1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Hanai1">[30]</xref>. In the experimental animal a turmeric extract has been shown to prevent the development of Trinitrobenzene Sulfonic Acid (TNBS)-induced colitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Sugimoto1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Jian1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Ukil1">[33]</xref> through the inhibition of signal transduction pathways critical to inflammatory responses, such as AP-1, protein kinase C, and NF-<italic>κ</italic>B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Bharti1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Han1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Xu2">[37]</xref>.

In addition, Curcuma, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, has been shown to be effective and safe in maintaining ulcerative colitis remission, and to decrease active oxygen species production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Hanai1">[30]</xref>. So far, many data are available about <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> anti-inflammatory properties, but little and conflicting information is available about the effect of <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> on intestinal motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Shimouchi1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Itthipanichpong1">[42]</xref>. The wide clinical use of <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> as an anti-inflammatory agent in IBD and its empiric use in diarrhea in eastern countries prompted the present investigation in order to evaluate whether Curcuma exerts some myorelaxant effect on intestinal ileal and colonic motility in healthy intestinal segments, whether this effect, if any, is also observed in DSS induced acute and chronic experimental colitis, and, finally, whether this effect is independent of the anti-inflammatory effect.</p>

        <p>Mice were divided into 5 groups: a first group of healthy animals (n 15) was used as donors of intestinal segments in order to evaluate the in vitro effect of Curcuma extracton intestinal motility parameters by antagonism of Carbachol-induced contraction in isolated ileum and distal colon. In a second and a third group of animals Dextran Sodium Sulphate (DSS) (MP Biomedicals, Solon; OH, USA; m.w. 36.000–50.000) chronic (n 50) and acute(n 25) colitis (see below) respectively were induced and the effect of DSS on the Disease Activity parameters and intestinal motility were evaluated. After colitis induction, Curcuma extract was orally administered (200 mg/kg b.w./day) and, at fixed time intervals, (see below), the Disease Activity parameters and intestinal motility were evaluated. A fourth group of animals (n 14) was used as controls and a fifth group of mice (n 6) were used as Curcuma fed control, after oral administration of Curcuma over seven days. For all groups of animals, intestinal histology, spontaneously and Carbachol-induced motility were assessed. The effect of Atropine in Carbachol-induced contraction was also studied in order to get more insights into the mechanism of action of Curcuma extract on the ileal and colonic contraction.</p>

In healthy animals Carbachol is by 3.55 times more potent on the ileum than on the colon. Atropine presents similar antagonistic activity on both tissues: these data have been used as a comparison with the effect of Carbachol and Atropine on tissues from chronic colitis animals. After induction of chronic colitis, Charbacol pEC<sub>50</sub> decreased by 8.71 times in the ileum and 2.34 times in the colon and Atropine p<italic>A</italic><sub>2</sub> was increased by 1.35 and 3.09 times in the ileum and the colon respectively, compared with the corresponding intestinal segments of control mice.

        <p>Twenty four hours before the experiments, food was withdrawn and water was maintained <italic>ad libitum</italic>. The animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The abdomen was opened by median laparotomy and exposed. A portion of jejunum, immediately after the Treitz was removed (1.5 cm) and retained for histological examination. A 1.5 cm length segment of the terminal ileum, immediately proximal to the ileo-cecal valve and a 2.5 cm region of the distal colon were identified, slightly cleaned with Krebs solution to remove fecal residues and dissected into two parts: one part was placed in 10% formalin for subsequent histological analysis, a second was retained for immediate in vitro motility studies (see below). Stools were analyzed for consistency and blood traces.</p>

        <title>Histology</title>
        <p>The sections of ileum and colon specimens were preserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin for about 48 hours and routinely processed.

          <title>Histological grading</title>
          <p>Acute colitis is characterised by intense inflammatory cell infiltrate, crypt abscesses, mucin depletion, and surface ulceration, that are the main histological features of acute activity. The hallmark is the presence of neutrophils and eosinophils infiltrating lamina propria and crypt epithelium.</p>
          <p>Chronic colitis is characterized chronic inflammatory cells, plasma cells and lymphocytes in the lamina propria, distortion of the normal architecture of colonic mucosa, including crypts branching and regeneration. These morphological features induce a variety of altered shapes and sizes of crypts and changes in surface contours. Basal accumulation of lymphocytes and plasma cells with hyperplasia of lymphoid tissue probably represents an early immunologic manifestation of the underlying disease.</p>
          <p>Therefore, according to the amount of acute and chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate in colon and in small bowel slides colitis was classified in four grades as reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0044650-t001">Table 1</xref>.</p>

Each segments was set up under 1 g tension in the longitudinal direction along the intestinal wall. Tissue were allowed to equilibrate for at list 30 min during which time the bathing solution was changed every 10 min. Concentration-response curves were constructed by cumulative addition of the agonist Carbachol (CCh). The concentration of agonist in the organ bath was added only after the response to the previous addition had attained a maximal level and remained steady. Contractions were recorded by means of displacement transducer (FT. 03, Grass Instruments, Quincy, MA) using Power Lab software (ADInstruments Pty Ltd, Castle Hill, Australia). In all cases, parallel experiments in which tissues did not receive any antagonist were run in order to check any variation in sensitivity. Concentration–response curves to agonist were obtained at 30 min intervals, the first one being discarded and the second one used as control. A new concentration-response curve to agonist was obtained following incubation with the antagonist (Atropine or Curcuma extract). Tension changes were recorded isotonically.</p>

The ileal and colonic contractions in basal conditions were considered as 100% and the contractions in pathological conditions were compared with the control motility. In vitro curcuma extract inhibited the spontaneous intestinal contraction by 100% both in ileum and colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044650-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In vivo, when orally administered over one week to healthy mice, the spontaneous motility in the ileum and colon was reduced by 30%; the contractions were constant in frequency and amplitude. In acute colitis, intestinal motility was increased by 230% in the ileum; the contractions were highly irregular in amplitude and frequency; they were reduced by 100% in the colon; Curcuma extract administration over one week to mice reduced the by 50% the spontaneous contraction in ileum without any significant effect on the colon, while standard diet administration did not modify significantly ileal and colonic contractions. In chronic DSS colitis, spontaneous contractions increased by 400%and 300% respectively in the ileum and colon. They were of irregular amplitude and frequency. Seven days after curcuma administration, a partial normalization was observed in both the ileum and the colon; 14 days after Curcuma administration the basal ileal and colonic motility were normalized and were of constant amplitude and frequency. A longer administration (21 days) inhibited the basal spontaneous activity of the ileum and colon. Standard diet administration did not substantially modify the intestinal basal motility since only a partial recovery was observed with time.</p>

          <title>Response to Carbachol and Atropine</title>
          <p><italic>Curcuma extract effect on isolated ileum and colon.</italic> Initially we have evaluated the antispasmodic activity of <italic>Curcuma longa Linn</italic> Extract from rhizomes on ileum and distal colon. Experiments performed in mice ileum and colon showed that Curcuma extract inhibited the maximum response to Carbachol in a non-competitive manner. These results show that the extract produce a smooth muscle relaxation effect on mice ileum and colon, as previously described for Guinea Pig <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Itthipanichpong1">[42]</xref>. Furthermore, this blockade was reversed after 30 min tissue washing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044650-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The IC<sub>50</sub> value for Curcuma extract was 0.03 mg/ml in ileum and 0.04 mg/min distal colon respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044650.s005">Table S2</xref>). In both cases, the agonist activity was comparable.</p>
          <p><italic>Effect of Carbachol and Atropine on ileum and colon from control mice</italic>. In order to evaluate the effects of Curcuma extract on the intestinal muscular layers of ileum and colon, we have used as reference the contraction induced by Carbachol and the antagonistic effects of Atropine. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044650-g004">Figure 4</xref> reports Carbachol pEC<sub>50</sub> and Atropine p<italic>A</italic><sub>2</sub> on ileum and colon respectively.</p>
          <p>As it can be observed (for data see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044650.s006">Table S3</xref>), Carbachol is by 3.55 times more potent on the ileum than on the colon. Atropine presents similar antagonistic activity on both tissues: these data have been used as a comparison with the effect of Carbachol and Atropine on tissues from DSS treated animals (acute and chronic colitis ) and after Curcuma extract or placebo administration.</p>

          <p>Acute colitis was induced with DSS (5%, w/v) over 7 days in the drinking water, after which one group went on assuming the usual commercial diet, the other was switched to curcuma (200 mg/kg/day) added diet for 7 days.</p>
          <p>Carbachol induced contraction was reduced: in fact Charbacol pEC<sub>50</sub> decreased by 3.80 times in the ileum and 1.58 times in the colon compared to the respective control intestinal segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044650-g005">Figure 5</xref>; for data see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044650.s007">Table S4</xref>). Similarly, the effect of Atropine was decreased: p<italic>A</italic><sub>2</sub> was reduced by 1.86 and 1.12 times respectively in the ileum and the colon, compared with the corresponding intestinal segments of control mice. Both the effects were stronger in the ileum than in the colon: This finding is at variance with the histological damage, which is limited to the colon, resembling the histopathological features of UC. Seven days Curcuma extract administration improved the response to Carbachol in the colon, but not in the ileum, both in comparison with the response of colon from mice with acute disease and mice assuming control diet, also if it did not completely restore the normal values. The response to Atropine was decreased both in the Curcuma added diet group and in the controls. In the ileum, Curcuma extract administration did not even partially restore the response to Carbachol and Atropine.</p>
          <p>In order to evaluate whether Curcuma extract had any effect on normal intestine and compare it, if any, with the effect of Curcuma on the intestine from mice with DSS induced acute colitis, we have administered Curcuma extract over 7 days to control mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0044650-t003">Table 3</xref>, Curcuma extract, when added to diet decreased the response to Carbachol in the ileum, by 1.69 and in the colon, by 1.20, while it increased in both the response to Atropine. As it can be observed, the effect was greater in the ileum.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Scanty data are available in literature about the effect of Curcuma on intestinal motility. In healthy humans, an indirect evidence that Curcuma activates bowel motility has been produced by hydrogen breath <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Shimouchi1">[40]</xref>. On the contrary, Curcuma increases intestinal transit time in albino rats and ileal motility in Guinea Pig, consistently with the traditional use of curcumin in disorders of altered intestinal motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Kumar1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Itthipanichpong1">[42]</xref>. The use of turmeric as an anti-inflammatory agent in IBD and the traditional empiric use of Curcuma as an antidiarrheal symptomatic drug in functional disorders of the gastrointestinal tract suggested an effect on intestinal motility.</p>
      <p>The GI tract function is under neural control, extrinsic autonomic nerves influencing the activity of enteric neurons located within the wall of the gut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Furness1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Grundy1">[53]</xref>. Although the inflammation in IBD occurs in discrete regions of the gastrointestinal tract, the ensuing functional alterations, among which altered motility, are not limited to the inflamed segments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Linden1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Linden2">[55]</xref> and a reduced sympathetic regulation in uninflamed intestinal tracts has been demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Motagally1">[12]</xref>. The development of intestinal dysmotility may in turn result in abnormal growth of intestinal microflora, subsequently inducing a translocation of bacteria or bacterial products through the impaired mucosal barrier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Lomax1">[56]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In humans, it is under debate whether IBD is associated with hyper or hypomotility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Kohno1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Vrees1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Akiho1">[57]</xref>. Reduced haustra formation, but increased colonic propulsive motility and diarrhea seem to be present <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Reddy1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Kinoshita1">[59]</xref>. DSS colitis shares clinical and histopathological features of UC and reproduces a model of chemically driven colitis, where the damage of the epithelium is related to inflammation without an immune component. In our system, this model represents a good way to induce inflammation in the colon and to study its effect on motility. Conflicting data exist about the effect of DSS on intestinal motility in the experimental animal. Spontaneous phasic contractions and Carbachol-evoked contractions of distal colon smooth muscles have been found diminished by DSS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Qureshi1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Myers1">[60]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Ihara1">[62]</xref>. Conversely, increased Carbachol-evoked contractions and colonic smooth muscle hypercontractility were reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044650-Kondo1">[63]</xref>. These findings may correlate with differences in experimental conditions, strain and gender differences in the susceptibility of DSS-colitis. In view of the possible gene differences, we have used male Balb/c mice: Balb/c mice are a strain commonly used for all-purpose laboratory investigations. Moreover males have been preferred over females due to the phasic influences of sexual hormones on gastrointestinal motility. In the present investigation, DSS induces deep disturbances in basal motor activity of ileum and colon: it is worthwhile noting that in acute colitis a hyperexcitability of the ileum is observed associated with a depressed motor activity in the colon, while a severe hyperexcitability is present both in ileum and in colon in the chronic colitis model. The abolition of any motor activity of the colon in acute experimental colitis is in agreement with the clinical condition of the toxic megacolon. We have chosen as reference of disturbed motility the ileal and colonic response to Carbachol and the inhibitory effect of Atropine on the Carbachol induced contraction. Carbachol and Atropine are respective agonist and antagonist at cholinergic muscarinic receptors. Both agonist and antagonist bind to the cholinergic receptors M(2) and M(3), present in mice small intestine and colon cellular membrane. In the present investigation, we have induced both chronic and acute colitis in mice, since the chronic model is more suitable for Curcuma treatment. The muscarinic receptor agonist Carbachol generated a smaller contractile force in the DSS-treated mice than in normal mice: this was the case both in the inflamed colonic strips and in the normal ileal segments. The altered response to the antagonist is a further confirmation that the cellular membrane, where not anatomically altered, as is the case with the ileum, is functionally altered. In this study we show that, in control conditions, Carbachol effect is more potent in the ileum than in the colon, while the antagonistic effect of Atropine is similar. In vitro, Curcuma exerts an inhibition of intestinal basal and Carbachol induced contraction both in the ileum and the colon: this effect is non-competitive and reversible. The inhibition of basal intestinal motility demonstrates a direct effect on the intestinal muscular cells. The inhibition of Carbachol response is stronger in the ileum while the antagonistic effect of Atropine is increased in both. When orally administered to healthy animals, Curcuma has similarly shown a direct myorelaxant activity and an inhibition of Carbachol response on the ileum and colon, stronger on the former than on the latter. The effect of Atropine is conversely increased on both the intestinal tracts. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a myorelaxant effect of <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> both in the normal ileum and colon and in an experimental colitis model. The present experiments, in agreement with most of the authors, confirm that Carbachol-induced contractions are reduced in the colon in the DSS-mouse colitis model: in addition, in the present investigation, defective Carbachol evoked contractions have been documented also in the ileum. In acute and chronic colitis, Curcuma extract added diet improves the ileal and colonic motility: in the chronic colitis model, 14 days Curcuma administration restores the motility pattern in the colon and in the ileum, but after a longer Curcuma extract oral administration, once the mucosal repair is achieved, the myorelaxant effect of Curcuma is prevalent in both the intestinal segments and the inhibitory effect of Curcuma on the colonic muscular layers is predominant, showing that the inhibition on the muscular layers is independent of the anti-inflammatory effect. The potency of the inhibitory effect of Curcuma Longa on the intestinal motility is not powerful: this is not surprising since Curcuma is a natural substance and this should be considered in the translation from the animal model to human pathology.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, Curcuma extract exerts a myorelaxant effect on the ileum and colon independent of the anti-inflammatory effect. The mechanism of action is due both to a direct myorelaxant effect on the intestinal muscle layers and to a non-competitive and reversible inhibition of the cholinergic agent. It was beyond the aim of the present paper to investigate the mechanism underlying this effect. The present study provides the rationale for the use of Curcuma Longa in motility disorders of IBD and suggests a possible application to functional motor disturbances of the gastrointestinal tract, due to the myorelaxant effect on the normal intestine, independent of the anti-inflammatory activity.</p>
