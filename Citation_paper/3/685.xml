      <abstract>
        <p>Prompted by the discovery of new gastrointestinal viruses, the NIH, NIAID and WHO investigated the etiology of acute diarrhea that occurred from 1976–1979 in a global cohort of infants and young children. Rotaviruses were found to be major pathogens worldwide, whereas the Norwalk virus could not be detected using a radioimmunoassay. The aim of this study is to re-evaluate the role and diversity of rotaviruses and noroviruses in the original cohort using more sensitive current technologies. Stools collected from Asia, Africa, and South America (n = 485) were evaluated for viral genotypes by RT-PCR and sequencing. Rotaviruses were detected in 28.9% and noroviruses in 9.7% of the specimens, with G1 rotaviruses and GII noroviruses accounting for the majority of each respective virus. Various strains in this study predated the currently assigned dates of discovery for their particular genotype, and in addition, two noroviruses (KL45 and T091) could not be assigned to current genotypes. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated a relative constancy in circulating rotavirus genotypes over time, with several genotypes from this study becoming established in the current repertoire of viral species. Similarly, GII noroviruses have maintained dominance, with GII.4 noroviruses continuing as a predominant genotype over time. Taken together, the complex molecular epidemiology of rotaviruses and noroviruses circulating in the 1970’s is consistent with current patterns, an important consideration in the design of multivalent vaccines to control these viruses.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Diarrhea has consistently been described as the second leading cause of mortality among children under five years old worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Black1">[1]</xref>. Rotaviruses are the single most important agents of acute diarrhea associated with mortality in this age group, as these viruses were estimated to cause approximately 453,000 deaths a year, mostly in countries of Africa and Asia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Tate1">[2]</xref>. Noroviruses are the second leading cause of viral gastroenteritis in children under five years old, and are estimated to cause as many as 200,000 deaths annually among children in this age group in developing countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Patel1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Rotaviruses belong to the family <italic>Reoviridae</italic>, and are classified into three groups: A, B, and C, with group A being most commonly associated with gastroenteritis in infants and young children. Group A rotaviruses have a segmented dsRNA genome, which encodes in part for two antigenic outer capsid proteins that are used for viral classification: VP7 (G-type [glycoprotein]) and VP4 (P-type [protease-sensitive protein]) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Estes1">[4]</xref>. There are 27 VP7 genotypes and 35 VP4 genotypes that can infect animals and/or humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Matthijnssens1">[5]</xref>. The most prevalent G-types that infect humans globally are characteristically G1 through G4, with G9 and G12 emerging in prevalence and G8 and G10 more geographically restricted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Estes1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Santos1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Banyai1">[9]</xref>. Rotavirus vaccines have significantly reduced the disease burden in Europe, Australia, and the USA, therefore the World Health Organization (WHO) now recommends the inclusion of rotavirus vaccines in childhood vaccine schedules globally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Tate2">[10]</xref>. However, rotavirus vaccines are less efficacious in developing countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Armah1">[11]</xref>, which demonstrates the need for improved preventive and therapeutic strategies in areas where the disease burden is greatest.</p>
      <p>Noroviruses, of the family <italic>Caliciviridae</italic>, have ssRNA positive-sense genomes with three open reading frames. ORF1 encodes a large nonstructural polyprotein that includes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), ORF2 encodes the major capsid protein VP1, and ORF3 encodes the minor capsid protein VP2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Green1">[12]</xref>. Noroviruses are categorized into Genogroups (G) I through V, with GI, GII, and GIV infecting humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Zheng1">[13]</xref>. Currently, there are 8 widely-accepted genotypes in GI and 17 in GII, all of which have been associated with human infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Zheng1">[13]</xref>. Genogroup II has the highest circulating frequency, and GII.4 generally predominates as the most commonly-detected genotype in epidemic norovirus gastroenteritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Green1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Siebenga1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Gallimore1">[16]</xref>. Currently, there are no vaccines or antivirals available to prevent or treat norovirus gastroenteritis.</p>
      <p>Soon after the discovery of noroviruses in 1972 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Kapikian1">[17]</xref> and rotaviruses in 1973 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Bishop1">[18]</xref>, the NIAID Laboratory of Infectious Diseases (LID) of the National Institutes of Health collaborated with the WHO to determine the role of viruses in childhood diarrhea globally, particularly in developing countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-NationaInstitutoAllerganInfectiouDiseaseUSA1">[19]</xref>. The LID examined 438 fecal specimens obtained between 1976 and 1979 from infants and young children (including 2 adults) with diarrhea for the presence of rotaviruses and the Norwalk agent, the first detected norovirus genotype, GI.1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Kapikian1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-NationaInstitutoAllerganInfectiouDiseaseUSA1">[19]</xref>. Rotaviruses were detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 27% (n = 118) of the cohort, which was consistent with the WHO recommendation for rotavirus vaccine development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-NationaInstitutoAllerganInfectiouDiseaseUSA1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Based1">[21]</xref>. However, a radioimmunoassay developed for the detection of GI.1 Norwalk virus failed to detect any norovirus strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-NationaInstitutoAllerganInfectiouDiseaseUSA1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Greenberg1">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The availability of new diagnostic assays now makes it possible to detect a wide range of viral genotypes with a high degree of sensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Zeng1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Gouvea2">[29]</xref>. The aim of this study was to reevaluate the archival specimens from this global cohort, supplemented by 47 additional archived WHO specimens that were not previously tested, for the presence of rotaviruses and noroviruses. Furthermore, we examined the geographical distribution of previously circulating viral genotypes, while using phylogenetic analyses to assess genomic variation and evolution over a span of more than three decades. Our data confirm the predominance of the rotaviruses that launched concerted vaccine development efforts soon after their discovery, but show also an early underestimation of noroviruses as serious pediatric pathogens. This retrospective approach to rotavirus and norovirus molecular epidemiology and evolution provides insight for the prediction of epidemiologic trends that are relevant to the development of efficacious vaccines for viral gastroenteritis.</p>

        <title>Study Cohort and Specimens</title>
        <p>Diarrheic stools from 483 infants and young children and 2 adults from the following regions were tested for rotaviruses and noroviruses: Central African Republic, French Guiana, Senegal, Uganda, China, South Korea, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Singapore (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0059394-t001">Table 1</xref>). Collection dates ranged from 1976 to 1979, and ages of individuals, reported for 312 children, ranged from 3 weeks to 14 years old, with the majority between 3 weeks and 3 years of age (n = 284). Hospitalization status was reported for 266 of 483 children; 259 (97.4%) of the 266 children were hospitalized. Stools were transported on dry ice by air to the WHO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland where they were stored and later sent on dry ice by air to the NIH. Stools were stored upon arrival at approximately −80°C, and diluted into 2% suspension filtrates in PBS for testing.</p>

      <p>Rotaviruses and noroviruses are important causative agents of childhood diarrhea, particularly in developing countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Tate1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Patel1">[3]</xref>. Following the discovery of rotaviruses in 1973 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Bishop1">[18]</xref> and noroviruses in 1972 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Kapikian1">[17]</xref>, the LID collaborated with the WHO to assess the role of viruses in childhood diarrhea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-NationaInstitutoAllerganInfectiouDiseaseUSA1">[19]</xref>. With consistent evidence that rotaviruses were a leading cause of diarrhea worldwide, the WHO recommended rotavirus vaccine initiatives as a global health priority <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-NationaInstitutoAllerganInfectiouDiseaseUSA1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Drafted1">[44]</xref>. Norwalk virus was not detected in infants and young children in these early studies, although our current study supports an emerging consensus that noroviruses are second in importance to rotaviruses as agents of severe pediatric gastroenteritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Patel1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our analyses of these archival fecal specimens revealed that both rotaviruses and noroviruses circulated throughout the developing world in the late 1970’s. Rotaviruses were generally more prevalent than noroviruses, with the exception of Cayenne, French Guiana. The most common circulating rotavirus and norovirus genotypes were consistent with those generally observed to be most prevalent today (i.e. GII noroviruses and G1 rotaviruses) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Estes1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Santos1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Green1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Siebenga1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Gallimore1">[16]</xref>, and co-infections with representatives of both viruses were observed in multiple regions.</p>
      <p>Certain rotavirus strains detected in these archival specimens are of particular interest as they represent unusual VP7 genotypes or VP7/VP4 genotype combinations. One is a G2P<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Santos1">[6]</xref> rotavirus detected in a child in Entebbe, Uganda in 1976. The first G2P<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Santos1">[6]</xref> genotypic combination (strain 1076) was isolated from a neonate in Sweden with an asymptomatic rotavirus infection in 1975 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Gorziglia1">[45]</xref>. Our identification of this combination in Entebbe indicates that both asymptomatic and symptomatic rotavirus infections were associated with the G2P<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Santos1">[6]</xref> genotypic combination that circulated in different parts of the world in that time period. Moreover, in a review of studies published during 1997–2006, the G2P<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Santos1">[6]</xref> genotype was detected in 10% of African children with acute gastroenteritis, indicating that this strain has become established in more recent years in Africa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Todd1">[37]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In addition, G5 and G9 rotavirus strains were detected in a 4.5 month old and a 5 month old infant, respectively, in Hong Kong, China in 1978. G9 rotaviruses have been emerging in prevalence globally since the mid-1990’s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Santos1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Matthijnssens2">[8]</xref>, but the detection of Hu/RV/HK75/China/1978 indicates that this genotype has been circulating since at least 1978 in Asia. The VP7 gene of strain HK75 clustered most closely with those of the oldest lineage (I) of G9 rotaviruses, which no longer are known to circulate today, as they were replaced over time by phylogenetic lineages comprised of contemporary strains (II and III) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Matthijnssens2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Stupka1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-MartinezLaso1">[42]</xref>. HK75 is also the oldest known Lineage I strain and the immediate precursor to all contemporary lineages. It is of interest that Lineage I G9 strains have been shown to exhibit the broadest neutralizing cross-reactivity, as they neutralize Lineage II and III G9 strains to high titer, making them ideal vaccine candidates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Hoshino1">[46]</xref>. Previous analyses of G5 rotaviruses suggested that zoonotic or natural reassortment events may have given rise to G5 diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Gouvea3">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Cook1">[40]</xref>. Our analysis confirmed the presence of three previously defined G5 lineages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-daSilva1">[39]</xref>, each associated with at least one zoonotic event. All human strains clustered within two lineages (I and III), and both lineages also contained porcine strains, but no other types of animal strains, suggesting that swine may be involved with zoonotic transmission to humans. Lineage II contained no human strains, but closely related animal strains (swine, cattle, and horses). Strain HK69 predates the oldest known human G5 strains from Brazil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Gouvea3">[38]</xref>, which indicates that any natural reassortment or zoonotic event may have occurred as early as 1978.</p>
      <p>This study identified a variety of norovirus genotypes, and an evolutionary analysis of full-length norovirus VP1 genes illustrated this diversity. Norovirus genotypes from this cohort were diverse globally, indicating no evident trend in distribution. A previous evolutionary analysis of GII.3 noroviruses suggested that, although these viruses accumulate mutations over time, they tend to eventually revert back to the amino acid composition of older strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Boon1">[47]</xref>. Our analysis supports this finding and suggests that other norovirus genotypes may exhibit similar characteristics (GI.3, GI.5, GI.6, GII.6, GII.7, and GII.17).</p>
      <p>Genotype GII.4 noroviruses are the most common strains associated with outbreaks of norovirus gastroenteritis worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Green1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Siebenga1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Gallimore1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Zheng2">[43]</xref>. However, GII.4 noroviruses detected in this study (n = 6) were outnumbered by GII.2 (n = 10) and GI.3 (n = 8) noroviruses, an observation that could reflect sampling procedures or the distribution of genotypes at that time. The original objective of this study was to document cases of viral associated diarrhea in specific settings globally, and not necessarily to characterize outbreaks. One of the six GII.4 norovirus strains detected in this collection (Hu/NoV/C127/FrenchGuiana/1978/GII.4) had sufficient RNA quality for full-length VP1 capsid sequencing and phylogenetic analysis; this strain clustered with the oldest GII.4 variants from Children’s Hospital, Washington DC (1974–1977) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Bok1">[48]</xref>. However, two additional genogroup GII variants with closest homology to the GII.4 genotype (Hu/NoV/KL45/Malaysia/1978/GII.na and Hu/NoV/T091/Tunisia/1976/GII.na) were also detected in specimens collected in a similar time frame, but did not meet the criterion for belonging to GII.4 (&gt;14.3% aa distance) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Zheng1">[13]</xref>. Furthermore, strains KL45 and T091 were of sufficient sequence dissimilarity for each to be proposed as a new genotype (&gt;14.3% aa distance) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Zheng1">[13]</xref>. These GII variants have no contemporary counterparts, since none were available in GenBank, despite the ability to detect any closely homologous variants using the standard, widely used norovirus diagnostic primers employed in this study. Thus, strains KL45 and T091 came from unknown sources and caused single episodes of norovirus gastroenteritis without being part of the diverse repertoire of epidemiologically relevant noroviruses that still circulate today. Each of these viruses was detected in stools collected within one week of illness onset, making it unlikely that they arose from multiple mutations obtained during a prolonged infection. Since GII.4 noroviruses, the most homologous species to KL45 and T091, cause outbreaks associated with novel variants that displace others from previous years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Zheng2">[43]</xref>, it is possible that KL45 and T091 represent genetic variants that never became established.</p>
      <p>A GIV.1 norovirus was detected in a stool obtained from a child in Entebbe, Uganda in 1976 (Hu/NoV/E22/Uganda/1976/GIV.1), making it the oldest known GIV.1 virus. In an evolutionary analysis, E22 clustered with other human GIV.1 noroviruses. GIV noroviruses are commonly associated with infections in animals, including dogs and lions, and are suggested to have arisen in humans from interspecies transmission due to the genetic similarity between human and animal strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Martella1">[49]</xref>. The 1976 date of collection for strain E22 indicates that GIV noroviruses have been circulating in humans on multiple continents for over 30 years.</p>
      <p>Although this study contained a majority of GII noroviruses, we found a large number of GI.3 noroviruses as well. Rates of nucleotide evolution have not been reported previously for GI noroviruses, which circulate at lower frequencies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Kroneman1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Gallimore1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Boon1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Bok1">[48]</xref>. The nucleotide substitution rates for GI.3 and GI.1 noroviruses are similar for each clock model, which are consistent with traditional rates of evolution for RNA viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Duffy1">[50]</xref>, and with previously described rates for GII.3 and GII.4 noroviruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Boon1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Bok1">[48]</xref>. The comparability in nucleotide evolutionary rates for GI and GII noroviruses indicates that nucleotide evolution is likely not responsible for the higher circulating frequencies of GII versus GI noroviruses.</p>
      <p>Rotaviruses have maintained a dominance of the G1 genotype, and other minor genotypes have persisted in humans at lesser frequencies. Conservation of this limited pool of VP7 and VP4 genotypes suggests that multivalent vaccines may be necessary to obtain optimal protection against rotavirus gastroenteritis, and once formulated may persist in their effectiveness. For example, the oldest G9 rotaviruses belonging to Lineage I neutralize more contemporary strains of Lineages II and III, and therefore certain older rotavirus strains may be ideal candidates for attenuation and incorporation into vaccines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Hoshino1">[46]</xref>. Further evidence for the vaccine potential of archival rotavirus strains includes the presence of contemporary G5 rotaviruses that are most closely homologous with older strains, including strain HK69 from this study. The overlapping representation of antigenic VP4 capsid genotypes in rotaviruses with distinct VP7 capsid genotypes, which was demonstrated in this archival study and is also currently observed, further supports rotavirus vaccine development strategies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Santos1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Banyai1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Patton1">[51]</xref>. It is important to note that both multivalent (RotaTeq: attenuated reassortant with human G1, G2, G3, G4, and P<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Matthijnssens2">[8]</xref> antigenicity in a bovine backbone) and monovalent (Rotarix: attenuated human G1P<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Matthijnssens2">[8]</xref>) vaccines have reduced the burden of rotavirus disease in countries where vaccination programs have been implemented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Patel2">[52]</xref>. Although the composition of RotaTeq and Rotarix differ both in valency and source of viral strain (i.e. a reassortant with bovine backbone or an attenuated human strain), they have similar efficacies against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis, indicating that the relative importance of VP7 and VP4 antigenicity is unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Vesikari1">[53]</xref>. Moreover, the first live, attenuated rotavirus vaccine, RRV-TV, composed of a closely homologous simian backbone strain, including a simian VP4, was efficacious against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Vesikari2">[54]</xref>. Regardless of the specificity of vaccine formulations implemented to protect against the conserved VP7 and VP4 genotypes, additional surveillance data will need to be analyzed in the post-vaccine era to determine whether rotavirus evolution differs with the widespread introduction of vaccines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Patton1">[51]</xref>.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, noroviruses exhibit a large reservoir of genetic diversity, and our current understanding of this diversity may be limited, as evidenced by the presence of unique variants (and possibly new genotypes) detected in this cohort (KL45 and T091). Although KL45 and T091 have not been detected in current epidemiological surveys, strain C127 is an archival representative of the highly prevalent contemporary genotype GII.4, indicating that GII.4 noroviruses have maintained importance in the norovirus repertoire over more than 30 years. Thus, vaccination efforts against GII.4 noroviruses may be necessary. Several groups are currently investigating norovirus vaccine formulations for noroviruses and recent advances have been made particularly in GII.4-specific antibody epitope mapping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Atmar1">[55]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Lindesmith1">[60]</xref>. However, formulation of a cross-genotype, broad-spectrum norovirus vaccine is complicated by the lack of biological data, namely, it is unknown whether the designated VP1 capsid genotypes correlate with serotype specificity. Some insight was provided by a cross-challenge study in human volunteers, which demonstrated the importance of norovirus genogroups in protecting against disease, when administration of a GI.1 norovirus failed to confer protection upon cross-challenge with a GII.2 norovirus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059394-Wyatt1">[61]</xref>. This suggests that a norovirus vaccine may need to be multivalent, composed of at least three genogroups, which are most divergent among the noroviruses: GI, GII, and GIV.</p>
      <p>The preservation of archival specimens by the LID over many years has allowed this retrospective characterization of norovirus and rotavirus molecular epidemiology and study of the evolution from specimens collected in various venues of the developing world in the late 1970’s. This investigation documents that the relative importance of noroviruses as agents of childhood gastroenteritis extends back more than 30 years and also reflects an early underestimation of norovirus incidence when the virus was discovered in the 1970’s. The characterization of rotavirus genotypes and viral lineages provides relevant archival information that supports current efforts towards implementing multivalent rotavirus vaccines.</p>
