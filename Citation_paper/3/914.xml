			<title>Introduction</title>
			<p>In a previous paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] we have demonstrated that <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> L. extract exerts a myorelaxant effect on the ileum and colon of a mouse model of Sodium Dextran Sulphate induced colitis. The effect is not related to the well known antiinflammatory effect and it is more pronounced in the ileum in respect to the colon. The inhibitory activity of Curcuma towards basal and stimulated intestinal motility, associated with its spasmolytic and antispastic efficacy prompted us to propose the use of <italic>Curcuma Longa</italic> L. extract in the treatment of gastrointestinal tract functional disorders such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), in addition to its use in  the prevention of relapses and to maintain remission in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Although IBS is a complex bio-psycho-social illness with a multifactorial etiology, involving, among others, diet and life style, altered bowel motility is a common feature, resulting in chronic abdominal dis-comfort, pain, associated with changes in bowel habits that compromise the quality of life. </p>
			<p>For centuries <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> L., the bright yellow spice, derived from the rhizome of <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> L., has been used in folk traditional medicine as a household remedy for a wide range of pathological conditions, such as arthritis, diarrhea and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Presently, a growing interest for herbal medicine has prompted a large amount of scientific investigations about the biological and pharmacological properties of curcuma extract main component, curcumin, which has been shown to exert several biological actions  including anti-inflammatory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], anti-infectious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], antioxidant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], antithrombotic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], antiatherosclerotic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], anticonvulsant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and anticancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] properties, cardio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and neuroprotective activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], in addition to improving memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], reducing aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and determining benefits in psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Moreover, curcumin seems to protect from metabolic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] decreasing insulin resistance, obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and to prevent the complications. Curcumin, due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] is therefore a multifunction phytochemical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] that can interact with multiple molecular targets, modulating cell growth, inflammation, and apoptosis signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The wide range of potential therapeutical clinical applications and the possible use in intestine functional motor disturbances prompted the present investigation to focus on the safety of this natural substance. In fact, IBS is very common in western countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and IBS patients often complain of several concomitant associated pathological conditions, which may represent a controindication to its use. Therefore it is of main importance to evaluate the activity of this substance on other targets than the intestinal tract. Many animal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and clinical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] reports demonstrating the therapeutic effect of curcumin are so far available and support its use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] but few studies about curcumin toxicity, even at high doses, have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Moreover a comprehensive and comparative investigation of the dose-related pharmacological activity of curcumin on different organs is not available in the same animal species. The potential use of curcumin as well as of the natural curcuma extract is severely hampered by poor water solubility of the active ingredients and short biological half-life of curcumin, resulting in  poor intestinal absorption and low bioavailability irrespective of the administration rout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Moreover lipid Curcuma extract carriers showed a significantly higher and earlier serum peak concentration and a greater AUC<sub>0-∞</sub> compared with Curcuma extract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The phytosomized extract significantly improves its oral bioavailability, and its tissue distribution in spleen, heart, liver, kidney, lung and brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p>
			<p>Considering the potential use of <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> phytosomized extract in chronic conditions such as intestinal dysmotility disorders and in the prevention and maintenance of remission of IBD, requiring long time treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and due to the higher biodisponibility of this pharmaceutical form, it has seemed imperative a deep investigation following three main experimental approaches:</p>
			<list list-type="order">
				<list-item>
					<p>Intestine: to verify whether the <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> extract exerts any effect on other receptors systems or channels in the ileal tract and in the colon, the main intestinal segments involved in IBD, and to evaluate whether these effects, mainly on the cholinergic system, are also present in other gastrointestinal tract segments (stomach, jejunum and proximal colon);</p>
				</list-item>
				<list-item>
					<p>Other systems :to evaluate whether other effects are present on the smooth muscular layers of the biliary tract, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, where it is recovered in high concentrations;</p>

				<list-item>
					<p>Liver, the main organ in lipid and xenobiotic metabolism,: to evaluate the parameters of liver function and serum lipids and, since administration of curcumin has been reported to induce a slight decrease in bile acid secretion (-12 %) in bile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], to evaluate plasma, bile and liver bile acids qualitative and quantitative composition. </p>

				<title>Animals</title>
				<p>50 male Balb/c mice (8 weeks old, 25-30 g b.w.) (Charles Rivers Laboratories, Calco, Lc, Italy) were used. The animals were kept at constant light/dark cycling and constant room temperature of 22 °C. They were fed the usual commercial diet and tap water. The day before the experiment, food was withdrawn and water was allowed <italic>ad libitum</italic>. The animals were divided into 2 groups: a group (30 animals) was used as donors of the organs; a second (20 animals) group was administered over 28 days either 4RF21diet (Mucedola S.r.l., Milan, Italy) (10 animals) or 4RF21 complete food added with Curcuma (Indena Spa, Milan, Italy) extract at a final concentration of 1 g/kg. The delivery form of Curcuma used in the present study is a patented formulation of Curcumin (Free Curcumin; Curcuminglucuronide; Curcuminsulphate), a dietary phenolic, with soy lecithin. The two compounds form a non-covalent adduct in a 1:2 weight ratio, and two parts of microcrystalline cellulose are then added to improve formulation (www.phytosomes.info). The chemical preparation was proved to be 18-22% pure by HPLC total curcuminoids content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Each mouse received 200 mg/kg per day, i.e. the human equivalent dose for mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. </p>

After an equilibration period (60 - 90 min), the tissues were used to test curcuma extract (1 mg/ml) against specific receptor families (cholinergic, adrenergic, serotoninergic and CCK systems) and calcium channels, according to the tissue preparation method previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In some tissues it was used a cumulative dosing regime for curcuma extract was used, and only one concentration-effect curve was obtained per preparation. The addition of the drug vehicle had no appreciable effect on different preparations.</p>
				<list list-type="bullet">
					<list-item>
						<p><italic><underline>Gastric fundus, gallbladder, ileum, distal colon and bladder assay preparations</underline></italic>. Each segment was removed, cleaned and mounted longitudinally under a resting tension of either 0.3g (stomach) or 0.5 g(gallbladder) or 1g (others). Tissues were allowed to equilibrate for 60 min during which time the bathing solution was changed every 10 min. Concentration–response curves to agonist were obtained at 30 min intervals, the first one being discarded and the second one used as control. A new concentration-response curve to agonist was obtained following incubation with the antagonist or Curcuma extract. Tension changes were recorded isometrically. In all cases, parallel experiments in which tissues did not receive any antagonist were run in order to check any variation in sensitivity. It was always verified that the EC<sub>50</sub> values for the agonist in tissues receiving only the solvent were not significantly different (P &gt; 0.05) from the control values. In all other cases experiments were discarded.</p>

					<list-item>
						<p><italic><underline>Heart assay preparations</underline></italic>. Atria. The experiments were carried out on spontaneously beating mice atria. An initial tension of 0.5 g was applied. Contractile activity was recorded isometrically by a force transducer (FT 0.3, Grass Instruments Corporation, Quincy, MA) using Power Lab software (AD-Instruments Pty., Ltd, Castle Hill, Australia). The right atrium frequency was also recorded. After beating for several minutes, a length-tension curve was obtained, and the muscle was stretched to the length at which 90% of maximal force was developed. A stabilization period of 45-60 min was allowed before the atria were challenged by various agents. During the equilibration period, the bath solution was changed every 15 min, and the threshold voltage was ascertained for the left atria. Atrial muscle preparation was used to examine the inotropic and chronotropic activities of the curcuma extract added to the preparation on a cumulative basis (in the range of 0.01-1 mg/mL) and the responses were recorded. During the generation of cumulative concentration-response curves, the next higher concentration of the extract was added only after the preparation reached a steady state.</p>

					<p>Ventricles. The strips of left ventricle were driven at 1 Hz were used. The contractile activity was recorded isometrically by means of force transducer ( see above) The ventricular strips were stimulated by rectangular pulses of 0.6–0.8 ms duration and about 50% threshold voltage through two platinum contact electrodes in the lower holding clamp (Grass S88 Stimulator). The ventricles preparations were then processed as the atria.</p>

				<p>Total bile acids in plasma, liver and bile  have been determined by HPLC-ES-MS/MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Briefly HPLC was performed using a 2695 Alliance system (Waters, Milford, MA) separation module coupled with autosampler. The analytical column was a Luna Phenyl-Hexyl (150x2.0mm i.d., 4 µm particle size), protected by a Security Guard ODS 4 x 2.0 mm i.d. guard column, both supplied from Phenomenex. </p>
				<p>The sample preparation (extraction method) is different from a matrix to another.</p>
				<p>Liver samples: each mouse liver sample was weighed and 0.60 g ± 0.2 g was taken from different points of the sample; 2 ml phosphate buffer (0.005 M, pH 7.2) was added and the mixture was homogenized ,washed with methanol (3 × 1 ml). The mixture was sonicated for 5 minutes, vortexed for 2 minutes, heated to 37°C for 20 minutes, and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 minutes. 1ml of the supernatant (5 ml total) was dried under vacuum and resuspended with 2 ml sodium hydroxide (0.1 N). The solution was sonicated for 10 minutes, heated to 64°C for 30 minutes, and SPE was carried out on C18 extraction cartridges. The SPE cartridge was conditioned with 5 ml methanol and 5 ml water prior to sample loading. The liver sample extract was loaded onto the conditioned cartridge and washed with 10 ml water. The cartridge was then eluted with 5 ml of methanol. The eluate was dried under vacuum and reconstituted with 500 µl mobile phase solution; 5 µl were injected into the HPLC-ESI/MS instrument.</p>
				<p>Bile samples: mouse bile samples were brought to room temperature, briefly stirred, and 1: 10000 with mobile phase. Final solution was transferred in autosampler vials, and 5 µl were injected into the HPLC-ESI/MS instrument.</p>
				<p>Plasma samples: plasma samples (50 µl) were diluted 1:6 (v/v) with NaOH 0.1N and heated to 64°C for 30 minutes. The solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridge was conditioned with 5 ml methanol and 5 ml of water prior to sample loading. Plasma samples were loaded into the conditioned cartridge and then washed with 10 ml water. The cartridge was then eluted with 5 ml methanol and the eluate was collected, then dried under vacuum and reconstituted with 200 µl  mobile phase and 5 µl were injected into the HPLC-ESI-MS/MS instrument.</p>
				<p>Plasma free (for calibration curve): charcoal was rinsed several times, then dried. 50 mg of charcoal was put in every 1 ml of plasma  and shaken. After stirring at +4 °C overnight, the plasma was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes, then  filtered through Millipore µm 0.22 and stored at -20 ° C. </p>
				<p>Bile acids from different media were separated in elution gradient mode using 15 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH = 8.00) as mobile phase A and acetonitrile: methanol =75:25 v/v as mobile phase B. Mobile phase B was increased from 30% to 45% in 10 min, then to 70% in 10 min, and finally brought to 100% in 1 min and held constant for 3 min. Injected sample volume was 5 µL. Flow rate was 150 µL/min and the column was maintained at 45 °C. The HPLC is combined with a triple quadrupole  mass spectrometer with an Electrospray source operating in negative ionization (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) using a Quattro-LC (Micromass) triple quadruple mass spectrometer operating in Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) acquisition mode. MassLynx software version 4.0 was used for data acquisition and processing. Nitrogen was used as nebulizer gas at 100Lh.1 flow rate and as desolvation gas at 610Lh.1. Ion source block and desolvation temperatures were set at 120 °C and 180 °C, respectively. Capillary voltage was 3.1 kV and cone voltage was 60 V. Full-scan mass spectra and product ion spectra of each bile acids are obtained in the optimized mass spectrometry conditions. Chromatograms were acquired using mass spectrometer in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode Collision energies was performed for each bile acids. The Micromass Mass-Lynx version 4.0 software was employed for instrument control, data acquisition, and processing. Calibration samples were obtained in the 0.05 to 20 μmol/L concentration range prepared in plasma free (same preparation used for the samples) and only in mobile phase. Linear calibration curve parameters were obtained from the plot of the analyte peak area versus Internal standards concentration using a least squares regression analysis (weight = 1/x). Correlation coefficients were higher than 0.991.</p>

				<p>The biological activity of curcuma extract against histamine-induced contraction was studied in the isolated mice ileum. As shown in Figure lA, curcuma extract reduced the maximum response to histamine in a concentration-dependent manner showing a noncompetitive antagonist mechanism. The maximum effect was reached within 30-minutes incubation at a concentration of 0.025 mg/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080925-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The dose-response curve obtained with histamine after 45-minutes incubation (curcuma extract concentration: 0.025 mg/ml) did not differ from the curve obtained after are reversible, we studied the concentration-response curves to histamine after exposure to curcuma extract (0.025 mg/ml) at different washout times. As shown in Figure lC, the response to histamine was completely recovered after 60 minutes tissue washout.</p>

The first activity is mediated by release of acetylcholine from the intramural parasympathetic ganglion cell cholinergic receptors, while relaxation is achieved via a direct effect on serotoninergic receptors. Although pre-incubation with curcuma (0.1 mg/ml) abolishes the contraction, it has no effect on the relaxation induced by serotonine (50 µM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080925-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

				<p>At the concentration of 0.05 mg/ml, which is the concentration active on the ileum and colon, the induced contraction is 30 % of that induced by Carbachol as reference. At the concentration of 1mg/ml, the natural extract increased by 255 % gallbladder contraction compared to Carbachol. In both cases, the effect was reversed by washing at both the concentrations. Since curcuma extract addition does not interfere with Carbachol induced contraction, it can be inferred that it probably does not compete with cholinergic receptors.</p>

The frequencies of spontaneous phasic contractions of gastric fundus and bladder muscle strips from control and after addition of curcuma extract (1 mg/ml) were not significantly different (n = 5, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080925-g005">Figure 5G</xref>). Similarly, the amplitudes of spontaneous phasic contractions of gastric fundus and bladder muscle strips were not significantly different from hose treated with curcuma extract (1 mg/ml) (n = 7, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080925-g005">Figure 5H</xref>). Surprisingly curcuma extract (1 mg/ml) induced a stable contraction, without a modification if the tone, that was 23 % and 25 % of the Carbachol (1 µM) as reference in the stomach and bladder respectively. The contraction was reversed by 30 min washout; no effect was observed at 0.05 mg/ml Curcuma extract concentration. Trachea: The amplitude and the frequency of the spontaneous contractions of muscular strips after Curcuma extract addition (1mg/ml) were not significantly different  from amplitude and frequency of control tissues (n = 6, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080925-g005">Figure 5G and Figure 5H</xref> respectively) and induces a 24% relaxation on the tracheal rings, reversed by 30 min washing; no effect was observed at 0.5 mg/ml concentration. This effect is not mediated by the cholinergic system, since CCh induces contraction. </p>

			<title>Discussion</title>
			<p>In a previous paper we have suggested the use of <italic>Curcuma Longa</italic> extract as a therapeutical tool in diarrhea, due to its myorelaxant effect towards  the intestinal muscle. Irritable bowel disease (IBS) is a worldwide diffused multifactorial pathophysiologal entity with multiple brain-gut and neuroimmune interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. A drug modulating gut motility can be a useful symptomatic tool. Since curcuma phytosomized extract absorption is 30 times higher than the common <italic>Curcuma Longa</italic> pharmacological available preparation, and its recovery therefore in the different organs is much higher, like also its biological activity towards several targets. In this view, it is worthwhile evaluating the safety profile and the effects of the preparation on the smooth muscle of different intestinal and extraintestinal districts, besides getting more insight into the mechanism of action of this substance in the gastrointestinal tract. The common used antidiarrheal drugs (5-HT<sub>3-4</sub> receptor antagonists, lubiprostone, μ-opioid receptors agonist loperamide) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] usually are hampered by side effects. Some herbal preparations are also used as a therapeutical means in irritable bowel disease, both in the constipation and in the diarrhea feature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. The so-called "natural drugs" used in alternative medicine can have dangerous adverse effects and the scientific field of activity associated with drug safety is increasingly becoming a major concern for the scientific community. In this study we focused mainly on the curcuma extract towards the neuronal and hormonal regulation of the smooth muscle layers in different organs, based on our previous observation showing a myorelaxant effect of <italic>Curcuma Longa</italic> L. on the mouse ileum and colon: The observed effect was due to a noncompetitive and transient inhibition of muscarinic receptors. In the present investigation we have also studied the effects of Curcuma extract on the autonomous system in different organs. In the intestine Curcuma activity involves not only the cholinergic receptors, but also L type Calcium channels and the effect is stronger in the ileum than in the colon. It is noteworthy that curcuma extract also completely inhibits histamine contraction. The latter finding justifies the potential clinical use of curcuma extract in patients affected by IBS, who have an increase of pro-inflammatory mediators and present an augment of mast cells in close apposition to nerves, determining colorectal hypersensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. The same observation holds for the effect on 5-HT receptors: In fact, 5-HT plays a key role in the control of gastrointestinal motility, secretion and sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] and its spontaneous  release is significantly increased in IBS patients  and it may contribute to abdominal pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. 5-HT<sub>3</sub> serotonin antagonists used for diarrhea are not devoid of side effects: for example, alosetron has been suspected to determine colonic ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. In the present experimental model, serotonin induces a transient contraction of the smooth muscle, mediated by cholinergic receptors, followed by a relaxation, mediated by a direct agonism towards serotoninergic receptors. Curcuma extract abolishes the contractile initial response through its antagonism against cholinergic system, at the dose representing the IC<sub>50</sub> for the colon, therefore proving an antiserotoninergic effect. These results support the use of curcuma extract as a possible tool in the management of gastrointestinal tract dysmotility disorders. Since antidiarrheal drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] decrease gallbladder motility, impairing gallbladder emptying, their chronic administrations may contribute to gallstone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Basing on this observation, we argued whether curcuma extract administration contribute to cholelithiasis. Curcuma extract, at the dose effective on the intestinal tract contracts gallbladder smooth muscle: this result is consistent with the data obtained by Rasyid and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>],  who observed that curcuma induces contraction of the human gallbladder, thus ruling out a possible side effect of this natural substance. In addition, curcuma extract does not inhibit gastric motility even at a high concentration: on the opposite it induces a contraction of the fundus that is 23% of the Carbachol induced contraction; the concentration effective on the ileum does not induce any effect on the mouse stomach. The same mild contraction was also observed in the urinary bladder and trachea and it was demonstrated to be reversible and independent of the cholinergic receptors, at a dose 300-400 times higher than the IC<sub>50</sub> effective dose in the intestine. In addition, this contraction does not occur at the dose representing the IC<sub>50</sub> for the colon therefore ruling out any possible antitarget effect of producing dysuria and bronchospasm. The same observations hold for the great vessels: curcuma extract induced a weak contraction of the aorta at the same high dose and it has a minimal effect towards L type calcium channels in the muscular layers of this vessel. This finding is at variance with the high selectivity of Curcuma with the LTCC in the present in the smooth muscle of the ileum and colon, where the K<sup>+</sup>-induced contraction is reduced by 100% and 84% respectively. In addition, the negative inotropic and chronotropic effect of Curcuma on heart contractility and rate is present at a dose by far higher than the IC<sub>50</sub> effective dose on the ileal and colonic muscular layers.</p>
			<p>However, although in presence of normal liver parameters and serum lipids and glucose, it is worthwhile considering that both plasma and liver bile acid concentration is increased: this latter finding is in agreement with the data obtained by Deters and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], who have described that chronic Curcumin administration (100 mg/kg b.w./day) induces a slight decrease of bile flow (-7 %) and biliary bile acid secretion in bile fistula rat (-12 %), without effect on biliary secretion of cholesterol. The dose we have used in the present investigation is twice the dose used by Deters and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and it is possible that the effect observed in the present investigation is dose dependent. These data suggest that administration of curcuma, at least in rodents determines a mild cholestatic effect, responsible for an accumulation of BA in the liver cell and an increased back diffusion to the systemic compartment. The 2-3 fold increased bile acid serum concentration is still in the physiological range, similarly to the increased serum concentration that occur after feeding with respect to fasting conditions. Curcuma extract stimulates gallbladder motility and increased bile acids serum levels could result from a sustained BA biliary secretion following gallbladder emptying with a continuous input of the BA to the liver via portal vein. However, this can hardly explain the increased BA concentration in the liver. Biliary excretion of curcumin is mediated by multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp1, <italic>Abcc1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>] and Curcumin has been demonstrated to inhibit both Mrp1 and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2, <italic>Abcc2</italic>)-mediated transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. No information is available about any inhibition/ competition between curcuma extract and bile acids in the rat for Bile Salt Export Pump (Bsep, <italic>Abcb11</italic>), the ATP-dependent export system of bile acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Since only bile salts bearing two negative charges, such as sulphated tauro- or glycoconjugated bile acids share Mrp2 transport with curcumin and sulphated BA conjugates are mostly present in cholestasis, it is difficult to explain the high liver and plasma concentration of bile acids after curcuma extract chronic feeding in mouse, by a competition of di-anionic conjugated bile acids and curcuma extract for the Mrp2 transport system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. </p>
			<p>The different biodistribution of bile acids in the plasma-liver-bile compartment deserves further investigation, mainly in view of a chronic administration of this natural substance. The present investigation supports the concept of the importance of the evaluation of the antitarget effects also of natural substances that are largely used as a self medication and in folk medicine, in order to provide a pharmacological safety profile.</p>
