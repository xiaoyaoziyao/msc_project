<abstract>
<p>Yifei Tongluo (YFTL) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulation which has been shown clinical efficacy in treatment of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in China. However, the underlying mechanisms of the effects of YFTL are lacking. This study investigated the effects of YFTL on immune regulation with a mouse lung infection model with <italic>Bacille Calmette-Guérin</italic> (BCG). We found that compared with untreated mice, the lung mycobacterial load in YFTL-treated mice was significantly reduced, accompanied by alleviated pulmonary inflammation with reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increase of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Flow cytometry analyses showed that Th1 cells were significantly higher in the lungs of YFTL-treated mice at early infection time. The results suggest that YFTL-treatment down-regulates pulmonary inflammation, which facilitates a rapid infiltration of Th1 cells into the lungs. Moreover, the Th1 cells in the lungs were resolved faster at later time concomitant with increased the regulatory T cells (Tregs). The reduction of mycobacterial burden associated with improved tissue pathology, faster Th1 cell trafficking, and accelerated resolution of Th1 cells in the lungs of YFTL-treated mice indicates that YFTL improves mycobacterial clearance by maintaining lung homeostasis and dynamically regulating T cells in the lung parenchyma, and suggests that YFTL can be used as host-directed therapies that target immune responses to mycobacterial infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) is a major health problem worldwide that causes mortality of almost 2 million persons per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref001">1</xref>]. The susceptibility to the onset and progression of TB is not only the pathogenic destruction of infected tissue but the outcome of host immune response to the pathogen. Inflammation caused by a wide array of inflammatory cytokines in response to infection dictates the eventual pathology of TB by contributing to early host immune defense and initiating an adaptive immune response, such as activation and recruitment of Th1 cells to the infected site for successful control of TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref002">2</xref>]. However, the excessive inflammation may promote lung tissue damage, which causes TB to spread throughout the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref003">3</xref>]. Indeed, in <italic>Mtb</italic> infections, disease progression is associated with high levels of pro-inflammatory mediators and progressive accumulation of inflammatory cells in the lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref004">4</xref>]. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a lipid mediator and essential homeostatic factor with multiple functions in regulation of immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref005">5</xref>]. Studies have shown that significantly higher bacterial burden is found in PGE2-deficient MΦs than in wild-type MΦs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref006">6</xref>]. Recently, more studies demonstrated that PGE2 production is significantly lower in virulent <italic>Mtb</italic> infection than in avirulent <italic>Mtb</italic> infection and augment of PGE2 levels inhibits <italic>Mtb</italic> replication and prevents acute mortality of <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref008">8</xref>]. These findings indicate that PGE2 is an important mediator in the regulation of immune responses to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection.</p>
<p>Th1 (CD4<sup>+</sup> IFN-γ<sup>+</sup>) cells in the lung parenchyma are a major element of adaptive immune defense required for containing <italic>Mtb</italic> infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref009">9</xref>]; however, the T-cell response is delayed in <italic>Mtb</italic> infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref010">10</xref>]. It is known that a sufficient recruitment of effective T cells in the lungs requires a homeostatic environment of the lungs and that the inflammatory environment within the lung lesion can limit the acquired immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref012">12</xref>]. On the other hand, uncontrolled Th1 type immune responses are associated with increased tissue destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref014">14</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to recruit Th1 cells rapidly to infected sites and to attenuate the process for limiting tissue injury.</p>
<p>Chemotherapy treatment regimens for TB are being complicated by the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref016">16</xref>] and characterized by a long term and complex drug regimen that usually cause problems with toxicity and compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref017">17</xref>]. Therefore, the development of effective and safe therapies is urgently required. Host-directed therapies (HDTs) that target the host's immune response to the infection can be an efficient treatment for TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref008">8</xref>] and have gained attention as a means to improve treatment outcomes of drug-resistant TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref018">18</xref>]. Yifei Tongluo (YFTL) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulation that contains multiple herbs for balance of Yin and Yang, a system of two opposites but complementary aspects of nature to maintain immune homeostasis. Treatment with YFTL with the combination of chemotherapy agents has improved the clinical symptoms of patients with MDR-TB in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref021">21</xref>]. However, the mechanisms underlying YFTL treatment of TB have not been investigated although a study shows that YFTL enhances the activities of natural killer cells and balances the ratio of Th1/Th2 cells of immune deficient naïve mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref019">19</xref>]. The purpose of this study is to verify the effects of YFTL on mycobacterial infection and dissect the mechanisms underlying the clinical improvement with a mouse model infected with <italic>Bacillus Calmette-Guérin</italic> (BCG). We found that YFTL treatment significantly reduced mycobacterial numbers in the lungs, associated with restrained early inflammatory responses and alleviated lung tissue damage. In addition, rapider recruitment and faster resolution of Th1 cells in the lungs were detected in the YFTL-treated mice than in the vehicle-treated mice. The results indicate that YFTL reduces mycobacterial burden by balancing innate inflammation and dynamically regulating T cell response in the lungs.</p>

<title>Preparation of crude YFTL and conversion of the human dose to the mouse equivalent</title>
<p>The components of YFTL are <italic>Polygonatum sibiricum Delar</italic>, <italic>Bletilla striata</italic>, <italic>Pseudostellariae Radix</italic>, <italic>Stemona sessilifolia</italic>, <italic>Ardisia japonica</italic>, <italic>Viola philippica Cav</italic>, <italic>Cirsii Japonici Herba</italic>, <italic>Asparagus cochinchinensis</italic>, <italic>Flos Farfarae</italic>, <italic>Carapax Trionycis</italic> and <italic>Retinervus Luffae Fructus</italic>. The YFTL extract is provided by Dr. Yanke Liu, Changsha Central Hospital (161 Shaoshan Rd. S, Yuhua Dist, Changsha China) and prepared as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref019">19</xref>]. The conversion of the human equivalent dose (HED) to the mouse equivalent dose (MED) was calculated according to a previous study by using the following formula for dose translation based on body surface area: HED (mg/kg) = MED (mg/kg) × (Mouse km/Human km), in which mouse km = 3 and human (adult) km = 37. The proposed dose of YFTL was 55.8 μg/mouse (20-g mouse), equivalent to a dose of 0.31 g/kg for human adult per day, according to the previous formula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref022">22</xref>].</p>

<title>Bacterial strains and culture conditions</title>
<p><italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis (M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis)</italic> strain mc<sup>2</sup>155 and BCG were grown in liquid Middlebrook 7H9 medium (Becton Dickinson) supplemented with 0.2% (v/v) glycerol (Beijing Modern Eastern Fine chemical), 0.05% Tween 80 (v/v) (Sigma) and 10% ADS (50 g/L bovine serum albumin, 20 g/L dextrose and 8.5 g/L NaCl). When required, kanamycin was added at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml. The mc<sup>2</sup>155 and BCG were kindly gifted by Dr. K. Mi (IMCAS). The mc<sup>2</sup>155 and BCG were cultured overnight until the OD<sub>600</sub> reached 1.7, washed with and resuspended in PBS, and used for all infections. Colony-forming units (CFUs) were verified by plating serial dilutions of cultures onto Middlebrook 7H10 or 7H11 agar plates, followed by 3-day (mc<sup>2</sup>155) or 21-day (BCG) incubations, respectively, at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<sec id="sec006">
<title>Mouse model</title>
<p>The mouse infection models were developed as follows: Female C57BL/6 (B6) mice aged 6–8 weeks were randomly divided into two groups (n = 4–6), and the control group was given volumes of H<sub><bold>2</bold></sub>O equivalent to the YFTL-treatment volume. Mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg) before inoculation. Mice were intravenous (i.v.) inoculated with 100 μl of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> suspension (1×10<sup><bold>7</bold></sup>/mouse) by tail injection, or intranasally inoculated (i.n.) in the left nostril with 50 μl of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> suspension (3.7×10<sup><bold>7</bold></sup>/mouse), or 50 μl of BCG suspension (1×10<sup><bold>7</bold></sup>/mouse). Animals were placed into cages in a supine position for recovery. Four hours after the inoculation, mice were provided with the YFTL treatment (55.8 μg/mouse) once daily by oral gavage for 7, 14 or 60 consecutive days.</p>

<sec id="sec007">
<title>Specimen collection</title>
<p>Lung tissues were harvested at different time points (3, 5, 7, 14 and 60 days) after infection. The mice were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub>, and efforts were made to minimize suffering; the lungs were taken, placed in 1 ml of pre-chilled PBS and used for lung tissue preparations and histopathological evaluations. The lung was then pestled and homogenized in 1 ml PBS, passed through a cell strainer (BD Falcon) to obtain a single-cell suspension, and divided into two parts. One part was used for evaluating CFU. The other part was centrifuged for measuring cytokines in the supernatant by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and for flow cytometry analysis of cells.</p>

<title>ELISA assay for cytokines and antibodies</title>
<p>A single-cell suspension of lung was centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 min at 4°C, and IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, CCL2, IFN-γ, and IL-12p70 levels in the supernatants were measured with ELISA kits (eBioscience, USA) and PGE2 with ELISA kits (MEIBIAO, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, diluted standards and supernatants of lung homogenate were added to 96-well plates precoated with antibodies specific for mouse IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, CCL2, IFN-γ, IL-12p70 and PGE2. Cytokine binding was detected by enzyme-linked polyclonal antibodies. The intensity was measured at 450/570 nm and the expression levels of cytokines were calculated according to the equation of the standard curve. Sera and supernatants of lung homogenate samples were undiluted and direct dispensed on Corning Costar 96-well plates (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) coated with heat-killed (HK) BCG (1–2×10<sup>7</sup>/well) for testing BCG-specific antibodies. Antibody binding was detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or IgA (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA), followed by 3, 3’, 5, 5’-Tetramethylbenzidine staining (Sigma). Absorbance was measured at 450/630 nm. A standard curve was generated by adding two-fold serial dilutions of purified mouse IgG (Alpha Diagnostic Int. Inc., San Antonio, TX, USA) or IgA (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX, USA) to anti-mouse IgG- or anti-mouse IgA-coated wells. The concentrations of the immunoglobulin levels were calculated according to the standard curve.</p>

Bacterial colonization was determined by colony-forming units (CFUs) in the lungs and body weight was monitored daily. The results showed that CFU numbers from the lungs of YFTL-treated mice was significantly lower than that in the untreated mice at five days post infection (p.i.), although was no difference between -YFTL and +YFTL group at other time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203678.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).

<p>Mtb inhalation is the main route of infection that causes TB. We examined the effects of YFTL in a model of intranasal (i.n.) infection. Mice were infected i.n. with mc<sup>2</sup>155 and treated with YFTL according to the protocol from the i.v. infection model. Similarly, at five days p.i., the number of CFUs recovered from the lungs of YFTL-treated mice was significantly lower than that in the untreated mice, although no differences in CFUs were found at other time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203678.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Interestingly, compared with the i.v. infection method, body weight recovery was significantly faster in the YFTL-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203678.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), indicating that the i.n. infection model is more sensitive to YFTL treatment. In summary, these results suggest that YFTL treatment alleviated the symptoms of the infection and temporarily restricted bacterial replication in the lungs.</p>
<p>We further tested the effects of YFTL on <italic>Bacille Calmette-Guérin</italic> (BCG) infection model with i.n. inoculation, a more sensitive model for mycobacterial studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref027">27</xref>]. Mice were infected i.n. with BCG and treated with YFTL according to the protocol used for the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> infection. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203678.g001">Fig 1E</xref>, the number of CFUs in the lungs of treated and untreated group was similar at seven days p.i., but at 14 days p.i., the number of CFUs in the YFTL-treated mice was significantly lower than in the untreated mice. At 60 days p.i., more than 1<bold>×</bold>10<sup>3</sup> CFUs were detected in the untreated mice, whereas the bacteria were almost cleared completely in the YFTL-treated mice; although the number of CFUs at 30 days p.i. was similar in both groups. However, the number of CFUs in the spleens at the indicated time points or spleen weights at 14 days p.i. between YFTL-treated and untreated groups were not significantly changed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0203678.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Body weight loss in the YFTL-treated mice was slightly less severe than in the untreated mice, with significance at three days p.i.. Both groups of mice had returned to their original body weight by 14 days p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203678.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). These results confirmed that YFTL treatment can reduce mycobacterial burden in the lungs.

<title>YFTL treatment significantly reduces pulmonary pathogenesis</title>
<p>Because YFTL does not have bactericidal activity <italic>in vitro</italic> we predicted that the reduced CFUs in the YFTL-treated mice could be resulted from host response to the infection. At three days p.i. when the body weights were significantly different between the treated and untreated groups, the lung weights of the untreated mice were substantially increased; whereas, no significant difference was found in the YFTL-treated mice compare with naïve mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203678.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Histological examination of the lung tissue sections showed that the BCG infection caused significant solidification of the lungs; however, while the untreated mice showed few intact alveolar spaces and a heavy infiltration of inflammatory cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203678.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, center), there was much more alveolar space and less infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lungs of YFTL-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203678.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, right). Consistently, flow cytometry analyses revealed that the number of neutrophils in the lungs was significantly lower in the YFTL-treated mice than in the untreated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203678.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), although was no difference between naïve and +YFTL groups.

<title>YFTL treatment significantly reduced the production of inflammatory cytokines in the lungs of BCG-infected mice</title>
<p>We speculated that the alleviated pulmonary pathology in YFTL-treated mice results from reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. ELISA examination of the supernatants of lung tissue homogenate showed that the levels of IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 were lower in the YFTL-treated than in the untreated mice at three days p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203678.g003">Fig 3A–3C</xref>). Less infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lungs of YFTL-treated mice suggests that YFTL may reduce chemokine production. It has been reported that a high level of CCL2 (chemokine ligand 2) is associated with disease severity in TB patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref028">28</xref>]. We examined CCL2 by ELISA and results showed that CCL2 levels in the lungs of YFTL-treated mice were lower than in the untreated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203678.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). These results suggest that the reduction in pro-inflammatory mediators diminishes the recruitment of inflammatory cells and alleviates inflammation in the lungs.</p>

<p>A balanced inflammation is required for host protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref029">29</xref>] and maintained by anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10. However, ELISA tests for detection of IL-10 showed that IL-10 production in the lungs was similar between the YFTL-treated and untreated mice at three days p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203678.g003">Fig 3E</xref>), indicating that IL-10 is not involved in the YFTL-mediated inhibition of early lung inflammation. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is another mediator that is able to prevent uncontrolled inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref030">30</xref>]. We found that PGE2 increased in response to BCG infection at three days p.i.; but dramatically higher levels of PGE2 were detected in the YFTL-treated mice than in the untreated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203678.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). The association of alleviated lung inflammation with increased expression of PGE2 indicates that YFTL balanced pulmonary inflammation by induction of PGE2.

<title>YFTL treatment changed the dynamics of Th1 cells in the lungs but had no effect on antibody responses to mycobacterial infection</title>
<p>To determine whether the YFTL-mediated resistance to the BCG infection was related to the T cell response, single-cell suspensions of homogenized lung tissue were analyzed by flow cytometry. We found that Th1 cells (CD4<sup>+</sup> IFN-γ<sup>+</sup>) were increased in response to BCG infection at 7 and 14 days p.i.. Noticeably, the number of these cells was significantly higher in the YFTL-treated mice than in the untreated mice at 14 days p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203678.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, left). CTL cells (CD8<sup>+</sup> IFN-γ<sup>+</sup>) were also increased in the lungs at 14 days p.i. with no difference between the YFTL-treated and untreated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203678.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, right). Recent studies have shown that lung parenchymal T cells exhibit a greater control over <italic>Mtb</italic> infections than intravascular T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref009">9</xref>].

<p>The Th1 cells in the lung parenchyma were continuously increased to higher levels at 30 days p.i. after the infection with and without YFTL treatment; however, lower levels of these cells were found in the YFTL-treated mice than in the untreated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203678.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) with similar CFU numbers in the lungs between the two groups at this time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203678.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). By 60 days p.i., the Th1 cells returned to basal levels in both YFTL-treated and untreated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203678.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) when the bacteria in the lungs were completely eradicated in seven of the eight YFTL-treated mice (87.5%) but were eradicated in only two of the eight untreated mice (25%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203678.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). These results suggest that YFTL treatment results in a timely resolution of the Th1 response in the lungs, which favors clearance of the bacteria. To determine if the lower Th1 response was related to the Treg cell response in YFTL-treated mice at 30 days p.i., the number of CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells was determined. We found that CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells were hardly detectable in lung parenchyma (data not shown). However, the number of these cells was increased in the hilar lymph nodes (HLN) of YFTL-treated mice, compared with that of the untreated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203678.g004">Fig 4D</xref>), suggesting that the rapid Th1 resolution in YFTL-treated mice is related to the increase in Treg cell numbers.</p>
<p>In contrast to the effects of YFTL on T cell-mediated immunity, BCG-specific antibodies determined by ELISA showed that serum IgG was significantly increased in response to BCG infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203678.g004">Fig 4E</xref>, upper panel), but no differences were found between the YFTL-treated and untreated mice at the tested time points.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Susceptibility to mycobacteria can result from either inadequate or excessive acute inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref032">32</xref>]. The immune response to <italic>Mtb</italic> must be tightly regulated to mount a sufficient response to contain bacterial growth while avoiding inflammation-mediated tissue damage. In the study, we employed a BCG infection model and demonstrate that YFTL, a clinically effective TCM formulation used in the treatment of TB patients, improves outcomes of BCG infected mice by regulating host immune responses, leading to increased eradication of the bacteria. The results reveal that the beneficial effects of YFTL on mycobacterial infection are due to its ability to suppress early inflammation in the lungs through PGE2 production and to regulate the dynamics of Th1 cell numbers in the lung parenchyma.</p>
<p>PGE2 has multiple functions in regulation of immune response, including suppression of acute-inflammatory mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref005">5</xref>]. It is reported that PGE2 induced by BCG is involved in the Th1-to-Th2 shift of immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref034">34</xref>], which is not favor clearance of mycobacterial infection. Recently, more studies demonstrated the critical role of PGE2 in inhibition of <italic>Mtb</italic> replication. However, the mechanisms are not clear. We found that YFTL significantly promoted PGE2 production in the lungs, concomitant with restrained inflammatory cytokines and alleviated pathology. These results indicate that increased endogenous PGE2 contributes to the lung homeostasis and suggest that the role of PGE2 might be stage-dependent, which is beneficial at early time of BCG infection by maintenance of innate immune response and detrimental to adaptive immune response by interfering with Th1 response. YFTL could avert destructive tuberculous lung pathology through induction of PGE2 at early time. More investigation is required to study the mechanisms underlying the regulation of PGE2 and dynamics of PGE2 production during YFTLtreatment.</p>
<p>The coordinated efforts of innate and adaptive immune responses are required for the effective host resistance to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref011">11</xref>]. Th1 response is induced by BCG and plays important role in clearance of BCG in the lungs of mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref036">36</xref>]. Higher levels of Th1 cells at early time in YFTL-treated mice could be due to YFTL-improved lung homeostasis during innate inflammatory response to the infection, which benefits <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrTHRsMVzxaVVMAywdXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTByYnR1Zmd1BGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwMyBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1513932685/RO=10/RU=http%3a//www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1165/rcmb.2003-0208OC/RK=2/RS=Ih5aFTdFRdKQUCezM__g8.ptKic-" xlink:type="simple">trafficking of Th1 cells</ext-link> to the infected sites and contributes to decreasing the lung bacterial burden during this lag time between the establishment of infection and the arrival of T cells. The alveolar macrophage (AMΦ) plays a key role in the immediate elimination of the bacteria by phagocytosis and is important in both the induction and effector phases of specific T cell responses by its multiple functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref038">38</xref>]. However, we found that the expression of <italic>iNOS</italic> mRNA was induced following infection of mice with BCG and was significantly suppressed by YFTL treatment at three days p.i. (data not shown). It has been reported that T cell proliferation is suppressed significantly by AMΦs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref039">39</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that YFTL-mediated reduction of iNOS is part of dampened lung inflammation and beneficial to T cell activation. In addition, <italic>in vitro</italic> induction of splenocytes activation and production of IFN-γ and IL-12p70 in these cells by YFTL also supports a contribution of direct role of YFTL in activation of Th1 cells. The effects of YFTL on multiple functions of AMΦs in both innate and adaptive immune responses will be investigated in our future study.</p>
<p>Treg cells are required for immune homeostasis and constitute an essential counterbalance of inflammatory Th1 responses. Although emerged studies point out the role of Treg in determining severity of TB, the function of Treg in TB still remains obscure and studies on the role of Treg cells in BCG infection are rare. It is found that a strong Treg cell response is associated with less effective BCG vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref040">40</xref>], indicating that Treg cells are indicative of ineffective immune response induced by BCG. While a number of studies support that Treg cells are associated with a detrimental outcome of active TB other studies demonstrate Treg cells are correlated with protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref042">42</xref>]. These differences may be dependent on the stage of an infection when the samples are taken for examination. We found that increased Treg cells in the HLN of YFTL-treated mice at 30 days p.i., concomitant with faster resolution of Th1 cells and more effective bacterial clearance subsequently; indicating that the Treg cells contribute to damping of Th1 response and suggesting that differential regulation of Th1 response is important for the outcome of mycobacterial infection.</p>
<p>A high structural diversity of compounds is expected in YFTL. These components may act to improve the therapeutic effects synergistically or independently. As a starting point to study mechanisms underlying YFTL-mediated improvement in TB treatment we focused on the role of YFTL as a formula in immune response to mycobacterial infection. The phytochemical active ingredients in YFTL, their metabolites <italic>in vivo</italic> and the cellular mechanisms involved in the modulation of immune responses remain to be further elucidated to improve clinical results of YFTL. TCM focuses on holistic regulation of immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref043">43</xref>]. Although the pharmacologically active ingredients in YFTL remain to be further elucidated we showed that YFTL supported a comprehensive immune functioning by dynamically regulating immune response to mycobacterial infection. The study indicates that a coordinated and dynamic immune regulation is critical for a beneficial outcome of TB. Most HDTs are still theoretical so far, except for the use of broadly acting corticosteroids, which may cause immunosuppression, leading to insufficient immunity against TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0203678.ref044">44</xref>]. Thus, more specific host-directed therapies are desired. The effects of YFTL on enhancement of PGE2 production and regulation of Th1 cells may make YFTL a HDT in TB treatment.</p>
<p>The findings in the study encourage us to ask more questions: 1) what is the efficacy of YFTL in a mouse model infected with a pathogenic <italic>Mtb</italic> strain? 2) If the infection will start again after 60 days of YFTL treatment is interrupted? 3) If YFTL promotes macrophage apoptosis and bacterial killing by macrophages with increased PGE2? In addition, refining YFTL formulation for more desired anti-TB effects would further improve the efficacy of YFTL in TB treatment and provide an effective alternative treatment for MDR <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p>
